Whereas, pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 1 of the act of June 12, 1934, by the joint resolution approved June 7, 1943, by sections 2 and 3 of the act of July 5, 1945 (ch. 474, 48 Stat. 943, ch. 118, 57 Stat. 125, ch. 269, 59 Stat. 410 and 411), and by sections 4 and 6 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 (Public Law 307 81st Congress), the period for the exercise of the said authority having been extended by section 3 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1948, on October 10, 1949, I entered into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Treaties and Other International Acts Series 1700) of the Governments of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Greece, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Italy, the Republic of Liberia, the Republic of Nicaragua, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, which trade agreement for accession consists of the Annecy Protocol of Terms of Accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 10, 1949, including the annexes thereto (Dept. of State Pub. 3664);8.

(Parts 5 and 6) A7, A11 and A2051);2. Whereas, by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. 1103), I proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation on and after January 1, 1948, which proclamation has been supplemented by the proclamations referred to in the second recital of proclamation No. 2867 of December 22, 1949 (3 CFR, 1949 Supp., p. 55), and by the said proclamation of December 22, 1949, Proclamation No. 2874 of March 1, 1950, Proclamation No. 2884 of April 27, 1950, Proclamation No. 2888 of May 13, 1950, Proclamation No. 2901 of September 6, 1950, Proclamation No. 2908 of October 12, 1950, and Proclamation No. 2912 of October 30, 1950 (3 CFR 1950 Supp., pp. 21, 28, 32, 51, 63, and 68);3.

Whereas reasonable public notice of the intention to conduct trade-agreement negotiations with the governments of the countries other than the United States of America named in the third recital of this proclamation was given, the views presented by persons interested in such negotiations were received and considered, and information and advice with respect to such negotiations was sought and obtained from the United States Tariff Commission, the Departments of State, Defense, Agriculture, and Commerce, and from other sources;5. Whereas (pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the acts specified in the first and third recitals of this proclamation, the period for the exercise of the authority to enter into trade agreements under the said section 350 having been extended by section 3 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1948), the trade-agreement negotiations with the countries named in the third recital of this proclamation having been successfully carried out, on April 21, 1951, I entered, through my duly empowered plenipotentiary, into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the said General Agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation of the Governments of the republic of Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Philippines, Peru, and the Republic of Turkey, and for the application of the relevant provisions of the said General Agreement to additional schedules of concessions relating to countries already contracting parties thereto, including the countries named in the third recital of this proclamation other than the United States of America and other than those countries previously named in this recital, which trade agreement consists of the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated April 21, 1951, including the Annexes thereto, authentic in the English and French languages as indicated therein, a copy of this is annexed to this proclamation;6. Whereas, in view of the provisions of section 508 of the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 (ch. 244, 60 Stat. 158), no trade-agreement negotiations were entered into by the Government of the United States of America with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and Article XXXV of the said General Agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation, as amended by the Protocol Modifying Certain Provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated March 24, 1948 (Treaties and Other International Acts Series 1761-1765, p. 49), has been invoked to prevent the General Agreement from applying between the United States of America and the Republic of the Philippines;7. Whereas, the said Torquay Protocol specified in the fifth recital of this proclamation having been signed on behalf of the Government of the United States of America on April 21, 1951, pursuant to paragraph 3 thereof, Schedule XX contained in Annex A thereto will become a schedule to the General Agreement relating to the United States of America on June 6, 1951;8. Whereas, under paragraph 4 of the said Torquay Protocol specified in the fifth recital of this proclamation, a government which has signed the said Torquay Protocol may withhold in whole or in part any concession provided for in the schedule annexed thereto which was initially negotiated with a government which has not signed the said Torquay Protocol;9. Whereas I find that each modification of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and each continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America which is hereinafter proclaimed in Part I of this proclamation will be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement specified in the said fifth recital of this proclamation on and after such date as may be notified by the president to the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register as the date on and after which the President considers such modification or undertaking to continue treatment should not be withheld pursuant to the said paragraph 4 of the Torquay Protocol referred to in the eight recital of this proclamation;10. Whereas item 781 [part] (Geneva), item 1205 [first] (Geneva), and items 1532(a) [part] (Geneva) and 1532(a) in Part I of Schedule XX contained in Annex A to the said Torquay Protocol specified in the fifth recital of this proclamation provide for the withdrawal in part of each of items 781, 1205 [first], and 1532(a), respectively, in Part I of Schedule XX (original) to the said General Agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation;11. Whereas (pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the acts specified in the first recital of this proclamation, the period for the exercise of the authority under the said section 350 having been extended by section 1 of the said act of July 5, 1945, until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1945) on October 30, 1947, I entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba (61 Stat. (pt. 4) 3699), which exclusive trade agreement includes certain portions of other documents made a part thereof and provides for the treatment in respect of ordinary customs duties of products of the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States of America;12.

(pt. 2) 3959), and Proclamation of November 28, 1940 (54 Stat. (pt. 2) 2461);13. Whereas on October 13, 1950, the said trade agreement specified in the eleventh recital of this proclamation was supplemented by the following provisions;1. If, as a result of unforeseen developments and of the effect of the obligations incurred by the Government of the United States of America or of Switzerland under the Trade Agreement signed in Washington January 9, 1936, including tariff concessions, any product is being imported into the territory of either country in such relatively increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to the domestic industry in that territory producing like or directly competitive products, the Government of the United States of America or of Switzerland shall be free, in respect of such product, and to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such injury, to suspend the obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or modify the concession.;2. Before the Government of the United States or of Switzerland shall take action pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph one above, it shall give notice in writing to the other Government as far in advance as may be practicable and shall afford such other Government an opportunity to consult with it in respect of the proposed action and with respect to such compensatory modifications of the Trade Agreement as may be deemed appropriate, to the extent practicable maintaining the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions in the Agreement. If agreement between the two Governments is not reached as a result of such consultation, the Government which proposes to take the action under Paragraph one shall, nevertheless, be free to do so and, if such action is taken, the other Government shall be free, not later than ninety days after the action has been taken and on thirty days' written notice, to suspend the application to the trade of the Government taking action under Paragraph one of substantially e1uivalent obligations or concessions under said Trade Agreement. The Government taking action under Paragraph one shall then be free, within thirty days after such suspension takes effect, to terminate said Trade Agreement on thirty days' written notice. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which it would be difficult to repair, action under Paragraph one may be taken provisionally without prior consultation, under the condition that consultation shall be effected immediately after taking such action. Where an action taken without prior consultation causes or threatens to cause serious injury in the territory of the other Government to the domestic producers of products affected by the action, that Government shall, where delay would cause damage difficult to repair, be free to suspend, upon the taking of the action and throughout the period of consultation, such obligations or concessions as may be necessary to prevent or remedy the injury.;Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the acts specified in the first and ninth recitals of this proclamation, do proclaim as follows;PART 1;The said proclamation of December 16, 1947, and the said proclamations supplemental thereto specified or referred to in the second recital of this proclamation, are hereby terminated in part to the extent that they shall be applied, effective after the close of business January 25, 1952 as though the items and parts of items identified in the fifth recital of this proclamation, and that part of the said second item 712 identified in the sixth recital of this proclamation relating to "whole chickens packed in airtight containers", were deleted from Part I of Schedule XX (original) of the said General Agreement.;PART II;To the end that the said trade agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation may be carried out;(a) Effective after the close of business January 25, 1952 the rate provided for in the second item 712 in Part I of Schedule XX (original) of the said General Agreement shall be applied to the products in that part of the said item 712 described at the end of the sixth recital of this proclamation.;(b) Effective after the close of business December 26, 1951 the rate of duty specified at the right of the description of products in the item at the end of the seventh recital of this proclamation shall be applied as if the said item were inserted in the appropriate numerical order in the list set forth in the seventh recital of the said proclamation of January 30, 1948, specified in the second recital of this proclamation, subject to the applicable terms, conditions, and qualifications set forth in the said list.;(c) Effective on and after April 21, 1951, the relevant provisions of the said General Agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation (Article XXVIII thereof) shall be applied as supplemented by the said Declaration specified in the eighth recital of this proclamation.;PART III;To the end that the said trade agreement specified in the eleventh recital of this proclamation may be carried out, effective on and after October 13, 1950, the provisions of the said trade agreement shall be applied as supplemented by the provisions set forth in the thirteenth recital of this proclamation.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.;Done at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.;HARRY S.

Whereas the trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation, the date for the signature of which by the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay was extended until December 31, 1953, has been signed by the said Government under such circumstances that it will enter into force for such Government, and such Government will become a contracting party to the said general agreement, on December 16, 1953;6. Whereas I determine that the application of each of the concessions provided for in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of the said trade agreement for accession which were withheld from application in accordance with paragraph 4 of the said trade agreement for accession by the said proclamation of December 22, 1949, as are identified in the following list is required or appropriate to carry out, on and after December 16, 1953 the said trade agreement for accession;7. Whereas serious problems which have developed in the cattle and beef situation in the United States since negotiation of the said trade agreement for accession render inappropriate the application to the products specified in items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of the said trade agreement for accession of rates of duty lower than those now applicable thereto;8. Whereas I determine that, in view of the circumstances set forth in the seventh recital of this proclamation, it is required or appropriate, in order to carry out the said trade agreement for accession as fully as possible while such circumstances exist, that the provisions of Items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of the said trade agreement for accession, which were withheld from application in accordance with paragraph 4 of the said trade agreement for accession by the said proclamation of December 22, 1949, be applied as though they were stated as follows;9. Whereas I determine that, in view of the determination set forth in the sixth recital of this proclamation, the deletion of Item 1530 (a) from the list set forth in the ninth recital of the said proclamation of January 1, 1948, as amended and rectified, is required or appropriate to carry out, on and after December 16, 1953, the said exclusive trade agreement specified in the third recital of this proclamation;Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, do proclaim as follows;PART I;To the end that the said trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation may be carried out as fully as possible, the identification of each of the concessions provided for in Part I of the said Schedule XX in Annex A which is specified in the sixth or eighth recital of this proclamation shall, on and after December 16, 1953, be included in the list set forth in the ninth recital of the said proclamation of December 22, 1949, as supplemented, Provided, That, unless and until the President proclaims that the circumstances set forth in the seventh recital of this proclamation no longer exist, the provisions of Items 705 and 706 in the said Part I shall be applied as though they were stated in the manner set forth in the eighth recital of this proclamation.;PART II;To the end that the said exclusive trade agreement specified in the third recital of this proclamation may be carried out, the list set forth in the ninth recital of the said proclamation of January 1, 1948, as amended and rectified, shall, on and after December 16, 1953, be further amended by deleting therefrom Item 1530 (a) referred to in the ninth recital of this proclamation.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.;DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.;DWIGHT D.

Eisenhower: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">April 25, 1956</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Please be seated. We will go right to questions.;Q. Merriman Smith, United Press: Mr. President, the Communist leader Khrushchev in London says that Russia will soon have guided missiles with H-bomb warheads capable of hitting every point or any point in the world. Now, Governor Stassen last night in London talked with Mr. Khrushchev on disarmament issues, and Mr. Stassen said he was sending you an immediate report.;I wonder if you could tell us first, sir, how you evaluate the Khrushchev statement, and second, have you heard from Governor Stassen?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I will answer it in reverse order because I know the exact answer. Yes, I heard from Governor Stassen, had his report this morning, which is long enough to require more study than I have been able to give it before I would want to comment on it at any length.;Now, I know of no reason why the Soviets should be making misstatements in this field, and certainly I don't accuse them of any such thing. But I do want to point out there is a very, very long distance between a laboratory capacity or capability of doing something and making an instrument, a really efficient, effective instrument of war.;These instruments are, of course, very expensive, require elaborate guiding equipment, and we know how expensive these things are when you put them on airplanes. So it is not a simple matter that we are talking about when we are talking about these things that are useful in the event of war.;Q. Ray L. Scherer, National Broadcasting Company: Mr. President, could you give us any specific views on how NATO might be broadened politically and economically?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, no, I couldn't give you specifically, Mr. Scherer, for this reason: here is something that I have been interested in for the past 4 or 5 years, and I have always believed that a greater usefulness was inherent in the organization that was established by the NATO nations than was to be represented merely in its usefulness as a military organization. Now, the Secretary of State, at the meeting just within a few days--the NATO meeting--is going to make certain proposals, and they will be there discussed, and if there is any agreement among the NATO nations, why, then, it will be published.;Q. Raymond P. Brandt, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Mr. President, could you amplify your thought of Saturday night about the board of rotating members on foreign aid and foreign policy?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I wasn't talking so much of foreign policy in its, you might say, theoretical or abstract sense as I was on foreign aid of all kinds, because here is such a big field.;I am not ready to amplify it particularly, Mr. Brandt, for this reason: there are a number of people that have had ideas in this field, and I am trying to correlate them, get them together and see if we are all thinking along the same lines. I do believe that we need a more disinterested, let us call it bipartisan, or unpartisan, or whatever you want to call it, study of these very major problems.;Officials, whether elected or appointed, or whether in Congress or in executive departments, are busy. They are always busy trying to get their desks cleared for the day. There is very little time in Government, as you know, for thinking, for contemplating, for pondering, and that has to be done.;Q. Mr. Brandt: May I ask another question? Will that be in time for this present session to help your recommendations?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't think that you could do anything like this hurriedly. I believe if we get such a thing established, I would like to do it with the greatest possible cooperation of everybody that has an interest in the Government. And I believe it will take quite a while before we have it.;Q. Mr. Brandt: Have you got any reports from Congress that your bill is in good shape?;THE PRESIDENT. I haven't put in a bill. Oh, you mean the foreign aid?;Q. Mr. Brandt: The foreign aid.;THE PRESIDENT. Oh. Well, all I get are reports that they are studying it. There is some opposition, always is. And there are some people supporting it. Some people of course think that we are being far too meager in what we're proposing. So just how it will come out, I wouldn't predict at this moment.;Q. Robert E. Clark, International News Service: Mr. President, Khrushchev and Bulganin indicated the other day that they would like to pay a visit to this country some time after the election. Can you tell us how you feel about this idea of their coming to the United States?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I didn't note that, and so I haven't made any formed conclusions on it. I wouldn't want to be quoted as meaning that I couldn't change my mind, but as of this moment, I see no useful purpose to be served.;I think that the particular issues in which there should be some agreement are well understood. They were thoroughly discussed at Geneva. They were discussed by the foreign ministers in October last, and I think until there is some new idea brought forward, there will be very little use of repeating such a visit.;Q. Carleton Kent, Chicago Sun-Times: Mr. President, have you formed any conclusion on the suggestion that the United States and her allies distribute foreign aid through the United Nations? If so, could you discuss it for a minute?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, the United States has always been, I think, by far the biggest contributor to important matters of this kind in the United Nations. I believe we have put in 50 percent, at least, of the money that has gone into the technical assistance program of the United Nations, and I think we pay 60 percent of the freight in the child welfare program.;We would be very happy to see the United Nations take a bigger and firmer hold and get more nations that are capable of contributing, more nations into the thing, if for no other reason than to make certain there was no political purpose behind it.;In the meantime, we are constantly studying our own methods to see how we can promote mutuality of interests and not merely be in the position of attempting to dictate or to bribe somebody.;Far from seeing anything against it, I would be in favor of seeing the United Nations take a more active interest in this business.;Q. David P. Sentner, Hearst Newspapers: Mr. President, would you care to comment on the revised highway bill which is about to be taken up by the House?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I can't comment on it too much, because while I talked about it yesterday, I am not sufficiently aware of all its details to discuss it at any great length.;Anyway, I rarely discuss details of legislation until I finally see it in its finished form. I have learned that a bill that comes out of Congress often bears little resemblance to the way it went in. But I still stick to this one thing: we need highways badly, very badly, and I am in favor of any forward, constructive step in this field.;Q. Charles S. von Fremd, CBS News: Mr. President, many Republicans on Capitol Hill are now saying openly that they think the Democratic-controlled Congress is a do-nothing Congress. Are you beginning to agree with them in this?;THE PRESIDENT. I have never indulged in that kind of talk. People that are accustomed to partisan bickerings, why, I suppose they have things they want to say. As far as I am concerned, I don't challenge anybody else's motives. I want to get results through thrashing out things on the anvil of logic and good sense, what is good for America. That is my sole purpose. I am not going to challenge anybody else's motives.;Q. William H. Lawrence, New York Times: Some time ago, Mr. President, you told us that you had asked Vice President Nixon to chart his own course and then report back to you. Has he done this?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, he hasn't reported back in the terms in which I used the expression that morning, no.;Q. Sarah McClendon, El Paso Times: Mr. President, I wonder if you think it is quite fair to give price support to corn farmers when they are not under the limitations of acreage controls, and not do the same thing for the cotton farmer or the wheat farmer.;THE PRESIDENT. One thing that made the corn farmer considerably different from others was the fact that the high supports of wheat and the low supports on corn finally had the corn market in almost a debacle, because there were so few farmers really participating.;Now, trying to handle agriculture across the board, the administration proposed, as you know, a 9-point program last January. They have been working very hard to get it through. Failing to get that bill, and particularly in time to do any good now, we had to take measures that we would be far from recommending as an all-time or a permanent thing, but we had to take measures that did recognize the situation which agriculture and its important parts had reached.;Q. Charles E. Shutt, Telenews: It has been suggested, sir, that a possible Summit conference might effect a settlement, a peaceful one, in the Mid-East. Do you think that would be a good idea, and would you be willing to participate in such a meeting, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, first of all, I repeat what I have said so many times. Where I think it would promote peace, I will meet with anybody and practically anywhere, as long as it is in keeping with the dignity and the self-respect of this country.;Now, I don't know among whom this Summit conference that you speak of is supposed to take place. Was it to be the head of Israel and the head of Egypt and Britain and a few more that are interested in the area, or who was it?;Q. Mr. Shutt: France and Russia and the United States included, sir, including Russia on the basis that of some--;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I will only say this: in all such proposals, as always, you have to take a look at all the details that are placed before you, what is the purpose, what is the way in which people are coming there, if you think it would be a useful thing, then, of course, I would always do it. But I would have to be convinced it were useful.;Q. Ruth Montgomery, International News Service: Mr. President, Democratic strategists here last weekend decided that from now on they were going to make you the direct target of all their attacks instead of members of your Cabinet. Do you have any comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it is perfectly correct. I am the head of the administration, and I have been shot at before. [Laughter];Q. Rowland Evans, New York Herald Tribune: Back on missiles for a second, sir, could you tell us, one, whether you think it is very important that the United States achieve an accurate long-range missile before the Soviet Union, and two, if you do think that is important, could you tell us why?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, frankly, one of the great reasons is psychological in this field. We have been very busy, the whole world, in developing weapons of very great destruction. One of them is the great, fast bomber, armed with these new types of explosive weapons and flying at such heights and such speeds that interception is very, very difficult indeed.;So there has developed a great power for destruction that as long as both sides have it probably tends to work as a deterrent both ways. When you bring in the guided missile, you bring it in as a reinforcement to a capacity that exists. You can make your own judgment whether it exists in sufficient force, but it does exist. So the guided missile, then, would be to reinforce that capacity for destruction.;Now, I do believe this: you can scarcely overemphasize the psychological value of such a weapon, because it has sort of a terrifying, let us say, result upon the human mind to think of something flying off through space at several times the speed of sound and at tremendous altitudes, and coming down then with these great hydrogen bomb bursts. It would be a terrific thing. But as I pointed out, those things are not simple. They are very expensive, and it will take a long time to produce them, even after the secret is first achieved.;Q. Mr. Evans: Could I ask one more question?;THE PRESIDENT. All right.;Q. Mr. Evans: Do you still say as you did in February that the United States is making the maximum effort? There are Democrats who say we are not.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am sorry you said "Democrats." There are lots of people saying we are not. [Laughter] But there are only so many scientists, there are only so many facilities, and you get to a point where mere expenditure of money in a field like this does no good. My own conviction, supported by that of many, many experts, is that in this field we are somewhere certainly around the limit.;Now, no man, I believe, in the world would say by just doing one thing more somebody out in the woods might find out something, but as far as the employment of the best scientists in several different areas, in several different groupments, is concerned, we are working at top speed on this whole thing.;Q. Mrs. May Craig, Portland (Maine) Press Herald: Mr. President, Mr. Stevenson and one of the members of the Atomic Energy Commission have suggested that the United States should halt its tests of the H-bomb. Would you comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I usually ask you people not to quote someone else when you want me to talk, because I don't comment on somebody else's opinion. They are entitled to their own opinions. But I do want to point this out: it is a little bit of a paradox to urge that we work just as hard as we know how on the guided missile and that we stop all research on the hydrogen bomb, because one without the other is rather useless. So we go ahead with this hydrogen bomb--not to make a bigger bang, not to cause more destruction--to find out ways and means in which you can limit it, make it useful in defensive purposes, of shooting against a fleet of airplanes that are coming over, to reduce fallout, to make it more of a military weapon and less one just of mass destruction.;We know we can make them big. We are not interested in that any more. So this whole thing goes together: the guided missile, with an expensive thing that is a one-shot thing, is really effective because it has a tremendous blow when it gets to the end of it. So if you don't work on one and get the right kind of explosive to use there, why work on the other?;So I think research without test is perfectly useless, a waste of money. And, goodness knows, I don't want to do this. If the world would allow us to put the money in schools and all the rest of the things, we all know what would result, the great benefit of mankind. But as long as we have to do it, let's do it right as best we know how.;Q. Edward P. Morgan, American Broadcasting Company: Mr. President, you seemed to be so much more at home in your off-the-cuff remarks to the editors the other night than in your prepared speech that I dare to ask this question;Have you had time to ponder the problems of communicating Government purpose and policy to the ordinary citizen? Official statements always seem to have to be so general. Mr. Dulles said the other day that it is time to raise NATO to the totality of its meaning. Democrats undoubtedly could furnish similar vague statements on their side.;Have you any suggestions as to how to improve political semantics?;THE PRESIDENT. You know, you must stick to small words when you're talking to me. [Laughter];The reason that I made my off-the-cuff talk was to try to convey to editors, to the press in general, to all media of mass communications, that there is a terrific responsibility resting on everybody in this country, not merely on Government, not merely on the President, or not merely on the Congress.;If a nation is going to lead, I point out again, it is absolutely impossible for the individual to delegate his responsibilities in the field to political figures, even the most trusted. We must know, because a policy doesn't become translated into national leadership until the nation is truly leading.;Now, the nation expresses itself through its elected heads and through its Congress, and so on, but we need an understanding in this country of what is going on in the world, what are the troubles, what are the difficulties, why can't we make better progress?;I'd put it this way: I know of nothing more important than that the United States gain a constantly improving understanding of what are the main difficulties in the world, what are the principal ways of attacking those difficulties so we can achieve a program of peace.;So my first statement is merely this: that it isn't just on Congress, it isn't on the Democrats or on the Republicans, it isn't on the President alone. They have very great and responsible duties. But it is on everybody who sees or believes he sees some of the basic factors in this problem and has some little ability or opportunity to explain them to others, because they are very, very serious.;Q. Chalmers M. Roberts, Washington Post and Times Herald: Mr. President, some time ago you described to us on the arms control issue what you considered to be the opposing approaches of the U. S. and the Soviet Union on the control problem. Was there anything in Governor Stassen's report that would indicate any sign of change on the Soviet approach?;THE PRESIDENT. Not so far as I have seen. As I say, I have not studied the entire report and I can't say that there isn't something in the fine print I haven't read yet. But as far as I know, there has been no change in the approach to the problem.;Q. Elie Abel, New York Times: Mr. President, on this matter, sir, getting back to the question of communicating with Congress in this case, there seems to be very considerable apprehension in Congress over this foreign aid thing, particularly the long-term commitment feature, and any number of responsible congressional leaders have been telling us that they don't understand precisely what this commitment is to mean and precisely how it is to operate.;Could you expand a little bit, sir, on what kind of project specifically you have in mind and what kind of authority you would settle for?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, first of all, it is quite clear that one Congress cannot commit another. Any policy in the United States has to have yearly appropriations to carry it out, and there is no disposition to try to ignore those facts in the problem. But a nation wants to start a great dam or a great school system, both of which you think would be very important in bringing it along into a position where it could support freedom, could raise its economy to the position it could.;Now, you say, "All right. We will give you X million dollars a year to help this out. We will take some of it in a loan, we will take some in soft currency and spend it in your country, with regular arrangements.;But they say, "All right. That is all right for this year. But how about next? There is an election in the United States.;Well, all that you are asking for and all you can ask for in a long-term commitment is that you take such projects as that, enumerate them, specifying them if you want to, but generally classifying them rather than enumerating them, because you don't know when one will come up. And for a very small part of this sum--I believe we said $ 100 million, is all--let Congress announce its intention to support that kind of an approach, which doesn't do anything for the future except it convinces the other fellow with whom we are dealing that the United States as a whole, not just the President, not just the Secretary of State, believes in this sort of long-range help in this particular type problem. That is all there is to it. There is no additional authority except it is the backup, it is the backup by Congress of a commitment the President would normally have to make by himself.;Q. Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune: Mr. President, may I ask another question about Mr. Nixon? Even though he may not have replied to you in the same terms that you used at the press conference, I would like to ask if he had replied in any manner which gives to you an impression as to whether he would like to be renominated?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I am not going to talk about impressions, Mr. Drummond, for the simple reason that a fellow can get those rather erroneously at times. At least, they have about me, at times.;I would say this: he hasn't given me any authority to quote him, any answer that I would consider final and definitive.;Q. Edwin L. Dale, New York Times: Mr. President, it has been rather widely reported that your Secretary of the Treasury and Chief Economic Adviser both had serious reservations about the latest increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve. There is a rather long history of this situation. I wonder if you have any comment on it.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the only comment I can logically make is this: the Federal Reserve Board is set up as a separate agency of Government. It is not under the authority of the President, and I really personally believe it would be a mistake to make it definitely and directly responsible to the political head of the state.;The Federal Reserve Board had the unanimous conclusions of their eleven district boards that this rediscount rate ought to be raised, and after studying the whole situation they decided to go ahead and do it.;Now, of course, the thing was argued for a long time. Certain individuals had viewpoints on the opposite sides of the fence. But having done it, I do have this confidence in the Federal Reserve Board: they are watching this situation day by day. They are watching whether money dries up, because there are two things about money: one, it gets a little dearer in its cost to the borrower, the other is that it is just not there to borrow. They are watching it very closely, and I personally believe that if money gets to what is normally referred to as too tight, they will move in the other direction in some way or other as soon as they can.;Q. Marvin L. Arrowsmith, Associated Press: Mr. President, on the basis of the latest reports to you, could you tell us what you think the prospects at this time are for a tax reduction during this session of Congress?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have discussed this with you people before. I see, so far, no logical reason for reducing taxes, and I really believe it would be not to the good interests of America to reduce them at the moment.;We are in a time of very high income. We certainly must be able to run our Government now without going into debt to do it or we never will. And I want to point out, in each of the past two years we have had to get a temporary increase in the debt limit to tide us over the months, the fall months, when income is low and outgo is high so that we run up to something like two hundred eighty-one or two billion, but always with the compulsion to be back to two seventy-five by June 30th, which we are doing again this year.;As long as we have that situation, if we can get a billion or a billion and a half or something of that order in advance, I think it is only prudence--I think it is what any housewife in the United States and any manager of a business would do--to put that much aside to keep himself solvent.;Q. William Theis, International News Service: Mr. President, would you like to give us your reaction to yesterday's presidential primary results?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, they have only showed me one, and that was in--no, they showed me two, one in Pennsylvania, one in Massachusetts.;I can only say, I am still astonished any time anyone votes for me, and very grateful.;Q. Robert L. Riggs, Louisville Courier-Journal: Mr. President, you were put on television Monday night by Senator Johnson in his own speech. Do you think the excerpts he used from your 1952 speech accurately reflected your views at that time on the farm question?;THE PRESIDENT. I won't talk about what anybody else said, but I will tell you what I said in 1952, time and time again.;I said that there was a law on the books that provided 90-percent rigid price supports for those basic crops through the end of '54. I said that law would not be disturbed for the simple reason that it would take that long to get all of the farm organizations and the farm authorities and the administration and everybody else together to work out a new plan. So that would not be disturbed, and I was for it, going to stay that way without any equivocation whatsoever.;I said, from there on, the goal we must have is to work for 100 percent of parity for the farmer in the market place. I said that over and over again, meaning that we must get the supply and demand so adjusted that the farmer was getting a good price without depending upon these 90-percent or 80-percent or any other kind of supports from the Government.;I went through this time and time again, and I think if you will follow through all these speeches, it never varied, because it was what I believed then. It is what I believe now.;Q. Lawrence Fernsworth, Concord (New Hampshire) Monitor: Mr. President, for several weeks past, the newspapers have printed charges that a Columbia University professor, Jesus Galindez, was assassinated by agents of the Trujillo dictatorship.;THE PRESIDENT. By whom?;Q. Mr. Fernsworth: The Trujillo dictatorship of the Dominican Republic. Yesterday a group of Columbia University professors requested the Justice Department to investigate these charges.;The question is, in your view, is it incumbent on the Department of Justice to determine the truth or falsity of charges that agents of a dictatorship which enjoys diplomatic immunity here are assassinating persons under the protection of the United States flag?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, you have laid down a problem of which I haven't heard. But I will say this: the Justice Department would have no authority in a foreign country. Anything that you did in a foreign country would have to be taken up with the State Department. That is your communication.;Now, I have no doubt if there are any grounds at all for the State Department believing that an American citizen has been unjustly treated, particularly in the way you are talking about, that there will be [laughter];What I meant to do was cover the entire field of injustice done [laughter] and not merely this one of extreme character.;But then it is the State Department's duty to investigate and demand an explanation of the whole thing, and what would happen I don't know, because I don't know anything about this case.;Q. Mr. Fernsworth: Sir, the assassination was supposed to have occurred in the city of New York.;THE PRESIDENT. New York?;Q. Mr. Fernsworth: Yes, sir.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, then, I suppose it would be--I thought you meant down in Santo Domingo.;No. I will have to find out about that. I don't know a thing about it.;Q. James B. Reston, New York Times: Mr. President, can you tell us whether there is any connection between the disturbing situation in the Middle East and your dispatch of four destroyers to that part of the world?;THE PRESIDENT. No, there isn't except in this sense, that we are always keeping forces in the Mediterranean, as you well know. It is our hope that they have a stabilizing influence, because it is also our hope that all the world knows that we are not trying to pick up the gage of anybody's quarrel against somebody else.;We are not trying to expand our own authority or our own influence anywhere. We are simply trying to keep the peace.;So if you can say that they have any relationship at all, it is merely wherever our forces are, whether they are in Formosa, whether they are in the Japanese area, whether they are in the Mediterranean, it is always in the hope of keeping stability.;Merriman Smith, United Press: Thank you, Mr. President</td></tr>

Whereas I have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and of Australia, the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Belgium, Canada, the Republic of Chile, the Republic of Cuba, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Finland, the French Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Italy, Japan, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, Peru, the Kingdom of Sweden, the Republic of Turkey, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, all being contracting parties to the General Agreement, are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purposes declared in section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, will be promoted by a trade agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Governments of some or all of the other countries referred to in this recital;5. Whereas, pursuant to section 3 (a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 72, ch. 141), I transmitted to the United States Tariff Commission for investigation and report lists of all articles imported into the United States of America to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment in the trade agreement negotiations with the governments of the foreign countries referred to in the fourth recital of this proclamation, and the Tariff Commission made an investigation in accordance with section 3 of the said Trade Agreements Extension Act and thereafter reported to me its determinations made pursuant to the said section within the time period specified in the said section 3;6. Whereas reasonable public notice of the intention to conduct trade agreement negotiations was given, the views presented by persons interested in such negotiations were received and considered, and information and advice with respect to such negotiations were sought and obtained from the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense, and from other sources;7. Whereas, the period for the exercise of the authority of the President to enter into foreign trade agreements under section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, having been extended by section 2 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 (69 Stat. 162, ch. 169) from June 12, 1955, until the close of June 30, 1958, on May 23, 1956, as a result of the finding specified in the fourth recital of this proclamation, I entered, through my duly empowered plenipotentiary, into a trade agreement providing for the application of the relevant provisions of the General Agreement to additional schedules of tariff concessions relating to the countries named in the said fourth recital of this proclamation, which trade agreement consists of the Sixth Protocol of Supplementary Concessions to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated May 23, 1956, including the Annex thereto containing a supplemental schedule of United States concessions (hereinafter referred to as "Schedule XX (Geneva-1956) "), and which trade agreement is authentic in the English and French languages as indicated therein, and a copy of which in the English language is annexed to this proclamation;8. Whereas, the Protocol of Supplementary Concessions specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation having been signed on behalf of the Government of the United States of America on May 23, 1956, and the notification of the intention to apply the concessions provided for in Schedule XX (Geneva-1956) having been given on May 31, 1956, to the Executive Secretary to the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement pursuant to paragraph 2 of the said Protocol of Supplementary Concessions, the said Schedule XX (Geneva-1956) will become a schedule to the said General Agreement relating to the United States of America on June 30, 1956, and the concessions provided for in the said Schedule XX (Geneva-1956) shall then enter into force as specified therein;9. Whereas, under the authority of subsection (a) (3) (D) of section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and of subsection (b) (2) thereof by reference to that subsection, I have determined, in the case of those modifications of existing duties proclaimed in Parts I (a) and II (a) of this proclamation which reflect decreases in duties exceeding the limitations specified in subsection (a) (2) (D) or (a) (3) (B) of the said section 350, or in subsection (b) (2) thereof by reference to those subsections, that such decreases will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to the articles concerned;10. Whereas I have made the determinations regarding the ad valorem equivalent of specific rates of duty (and combinations of rates including a specific rate) and regarding representative periods, under the authority of subsection (a) (2) (D) (ii) of section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and of subsections (a) (3) (D) and (b) (2) thereof by reference, directly or indirectly, to the said subsection (a) (2) (D) (ii), in the case of each modification of existing duties proclaimed in this proclamation for which such a determination was relevant, using, to the maximum extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in section 402 of the said Tariff Act of 1930;11. Whereas I find that each modification of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and each continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America which is proclaimed in Part I (a) of this proclamation will be required or appropriate, on and after the date specified in the said Part, to carry out the trade agreement specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation;12. Whereas, pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended in the manner referred to in the first recital of this proclamation, on October 30, 1947, he entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba (61 Stat. (pt. 4) 3699), which exclusive trade agreement includes certain portions of other documents made a part thereof and provides for the treatment in respect of ordinary customs duties of products of the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States of America;13. Whereas by the following proclamations the President has proclaimed, in respect of products of the Republic of Cuba, such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States, or such additional import restrictions of the United States, or such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were found to be required or appropriate to carry out the exclusive trade agreement specified in the twelfth recital of this proclamation, or has terminated in whole or in part proclamations specified. in this recital;Proclamation 2764, of January 1, 1948, (62 Stat.

Whereas Part II of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947), which was made a part of the exclusive trade agreement specified in the twelfth recital of this proclamation, is supplemented by Part II of the Schedule XX (Geneva-1956), and I determine that it is required or appropriate, on and after the date specified in Part II (a) of this proclamation, to carry out the said exclusive trade agreement that Part II of the said Schedule XX (Geneva-1947) be applied as supplemented by the said Part II of Schedule XX (Geneva-1956);15. Whereas I determine that, in view of the finding set forth in the eleventh recital of this proclamation, it will not be required or appropriate to carry out the exclusive trade agreement specified in the twelfth recital of this proclamation on and after June 30, 1956, to include the items identified below in this recital in the list set forth in the sixteenth recital of the proclamation of July 22, 1955, specified in the third recital of this proclamation;Items in the 16th recital of the Proclamation of July 22, 1955 to be deleted effective June 30, 1956;411;717 (c);772;778;802;1530 (e);1541 (a);16. Whereas, in view of the amendment of Article I of the General Agreement by section A (iii) of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Modifying Part I and Article X= of the said General Agreement specified in the second recital of this proclamation, of the inclusion of certain products in Part I of Schedule XX (Torquay-1951) and in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1956), and of the inclusion of item 774 in Part II of Schedule XX (Geneva-1956), it is required or appropriate that, effective June 30, 1956, the references to Article I of the said General Agreement in the sixth and seventh recitals of the proclamation of January 30, 1948, specified in the third recital of this proclamation be amended to refer to the fourth instead of the third paragraph of the said Article I, and that the list set forth in the seventh recital of the said proclamation of January 30. 1948, as amended, be further amended to read as follows;17. Whereas, agreement for such withdrawal and modifications having been reached pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement, and pursuant to the procedures provided for in paragraph 1 (b) of the Declaration on the Continued Application of the Schedules to the said General Agreement specified in the second recital of this proclamation, I determine that it is required or appropriate to carry out the trade agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation that Part I of Schedule XX (Annecy-1949) be applied as though item 502 [first] were withdrawn therefrom, and that the value-bracket subclassifications preceding the subclassification for articles valued at more than $30 per dozen in item 1526 (a) in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947), item 502 [first] in Part II of the said Schedule XX (Geneva-1947), and item 502 in Part I of Schedule XX (Torquay-1951) be applied as though the said subclassifcations and items read as follows;18. Whereas I determine that, upon the effectiveness of the modification of the concession provided for in item 1526 (a) in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947) set forth in the seventeenth recital of this proclamation, the termination of the proclamation of December 16, 1947 specified in the third recital of this proclamation insofar as it related to a part of the said item 1526 (a), by the proclamation of October 30, 1950, specified in the said third recital of this Proclamation, will no longer be in the public interest;19. AND Whereas the following item was inadvertently omitted from the list set forth in the sixteenth recital of the proclamation of July 22, 1955, specified in the third recital of this proclamation, and I determine that the addition of the said item to the said list in its correct numerical order is required or appropriate to carry out the exclusive trade agreement specified in the twelfth recital of this proclamation on and after September 10, 1955;Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930,

(pt. 3) B139);2. Whereas, by Proclamation No. 2867 of December 22, 1949 (64 Stat. (pt. 2) A380), the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and the other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the designated trade agreement for accession on and after January 1, 1950;3. Whereas that proclamation has been supplemented by subsequent proclamations including Proclamation No. 3040 of December 24, 1953 (68 Stat. (pt. 2) C26);4. Whereas the seventh recital of Proclamation No. 3040 set forth that serious problems which had developed in the cattle and beef situation in the United States since the negotiation of the trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation rendered inappropriate the application to the products specified in items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of that trade agreement of rates of duty lower than the rates then applicable to such products;5. Whereas the proviso in Part I of Proclamation No. 3040 states that unless and until the President proclaims that the circumstances set forth in the seventh recital of that proclamation no longer exist the provisions of items 705 and 706 in that Part I shall be applied as though they were stated in the manner set forth in the eighth recital of that proclamation instead of as set forth in Part I of the Schedule XX;6.

[Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. No, I haven't any formula. I can just say it's been a very happy experience and speaking from the advantage of my years, I would say this: that a successful marriage I think gets happier as the years go by, that's about all.;Q.

Well, I don't know exactly what you are adverting to when you say freedom of information.;This question, from the time of Washington, has been a live one. When the Executive determines that something will damage the security of the United States or its vital interests, then it withholds information that possibly could be put out. But, I don't know of any specific thing which you are talking about at this moment.;Q. Mr. McGaffin: Mr. President, if I could just spell it out briefly: Congress seems perturbed over various instances where they feel that the executive branch has misused the claim of Executive privilege and denied them information which they feel they should have. For instance, there are evaluation reports made by the ICA on certain countries which have received mutual security, Formosa, Laos, Brazil, Guatemala, a whole string of them, and Congress has raised the point where they are going to try to pass a law which would compel ICA to turn that information over to them.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there are certain things, particularly in the security field that, if you reveal, are very obviously damaging the United States, and I think anyone of good sense will see that. You simply must take measures to see that those things are not revealed.;For example, suppose you have a method of getting information. Now, that particular information can be obtained only in one way. Therefore you reveal it. Instantly, you can topple an entire system of getting information. So, there are all sorts of things that simply cannot be revealed.;There is nothing new about this. There seems to be a sort of a congenital built-in mutual opposition that I don't know why it occurs, I don't particularly feel it personally, but I know it's there and at times it comes to my attention in one form or another.;But, I am using my own conscience on the matter and when such things as these come to me for decision, I shall continue to do so.;Q. Thomas N. Schroth, Congressional Quarterly: Now that the new fiscal year is upon us, do you have any plans for a special message to the people regarding the fiscal problems?;THE PRESIDENT. Not for the moment, not for the moment, no.;Q. Robert C. Pierpoint, CBS News: Mr. President, in view of some recent statements by British statesmen indicating that they feel that a summit conference may already be justified by the Geneva talks, I wonder if you could reconcile the apparent differences between ourselves and the British?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, you say the differences between ourselves and the British. There are just as many opinions in Britain as there probably are in our country about the wisdom of many of the procedures contemplated in this field of negotiation.;Now, we have always taken the attitude here that there was no use to convene, or to go to a summit meeting, unless there was some ground discovered or prepared by the legitimate diplomatic agencies of governments which give some kind of promise to this summit meeting.;Now, this was the opinion and conviction of the foreign ministers as they came back from Geneva, when they arranged the recess, and I think it still is.;Q. Mrs. May Craig, Portland (Maine) Press Herald: Mr. President, the House Un-American Activities opened a hearing this morning on the type of art that we are sending to the American Exhibit in Moscow. More than half the artists have some record of Communist affiliation-with the movement.;One picture, for instance, depicts an American general in the most unflattering way, and the artist has said that generals of the armies are a continuation of the class struggle.;Would you review our presentation there to make sure that it truly represents Americans to the Russians?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I will say this: this is exactly the way the thing is done. The authorization for this fair, which is a very huge affair, and this furor about the art is really a relatively minor sector, as those of you who have been up to the Russian place--my goodness, the art is down in two fairly small rooms and the exhibition is all over two floors.;Now, in the same way, in our place, the artistic representation is only a minor part of this business. But no one in the Government had a single thing to do with it except Mr. Allen, as the official responsible for this kind of thing, appointed a committee. Now, who he got to advise him on appointing the committee I don't know, but this committee was made of curators of art museums, and I believe one of them was a president, and I believe another one was an artist, and so on. 1 They did make this rule--now this, I don't know why they told me after the event, because naturally there were details of which I know nothing--the detail is that there would be no art, no piece of art or painting that went over to Moscow except those produced since 1918, since the First World War.;1 As announced by the White House on February 24, the committee members, designated by George V. Allen, governmental coordinator of the exhibition, included Franklin C. Watkins, instructor of painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pa., Lloyd Goodrich, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York City, Henry Radford Hope, chairman of the Fine Arts Department of Indiana University, and Theodore Roszak, distinguished American sculptor.;Now this one of which you speak was produced in 1946. It looks like a lampoon more than art, as far as I am concerned. But I am not going, I assure you, I am not going to be the censor myself for the art that has already gone there. Now I think I might have something to say, if we have another exhibition anywhere, to the responsible officials of the methods they get the juries. Possibly there ought to be one or two people that, like most of us here, say we are not too certain exactly what art is but we know what we like. What America likes is after all some of the things that ought to be shown.;Now there are one or two artists, for example I think one of the artists in the classical sense like Andrew Wyeth--there is his picture, it was a woman, I believe, just a bust of a mother. I have had photographs taken of all of these because of this quarrel, or secured them from another source. I have nothing to say about them because I am not an artist, but I am describing to you what happened and why I am not now going to be any censor, or make myself, at this moment.;It seems strange--all of the editorial opinion I have seen on this is defending the committee very strenuously, and so I don't know what's right.;Q. Edward T. Folliard, Washington Post: Mr. President, in January, when you called for a balanced budget, there was a good deal of skepticism. Now, thanks to the business upturn, it looks as if the Treasury will get more revenue than has been expected, and Senator Lyndon Johnson and others, answering Charlie Halleck's crack about budget busters, say that Congress is going to appropriate less money than you have asked for.;In view of these things, Mr. President, do you look for a balanced budget and possibly a surplus in fiscal '60?;THE PRESIDENT. As you know, I am earnestly working for that, and not only the balanced budget that I have said before should be our minimum objective, we should be starting to pay something on our debt. And you can see that the sentiment of Congress is that we should, because they do not make the permanent debt $295 billion, they make it $285 billion and $10 billion temporary, which means you have got to get back by June 30th, back again on the balance. I don't know what's going to happen in that field, but it does show that Congress itself expects us to get in the business of paying off some of these great obligations. And I think we should.;So, my expectation is that we are going to do just that. I will be delighted when Congress can find proper ways to cut any of my particular recommendations, as far as their money is concerned, but I'll say this: merely because they are cut in one place doesn't mean that I haven't got a big concern about any increase anywhere else.;Q. Kenneth M. Scheibel, Gannett Newspapers: Mr. President, speaking of that exhibit and Russia, some people have the idea that you are sending Vice President Nixon over there to build him up as a presidential candidate for 1960 over Governor Rockefeller. Would you comment?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I suppose there is nothing that you can do in the last 18 months of any President's term that touches on any individual where there won't be some interpretation that he is trying to be political about it.;Mr. Nixon just happens to be the Vice President of the United States, which I think makes him a logical choice for someone to go over in high position and open our exposition.;Actually he has asked my brother to go, and I don't think anyone accuses my brother of having political ambitions, and there are two or three others in the party. Then, I believe, there is another planeload of newspaper people and so on.;But in any event, if they can find any political effect out of such a choice, why, I don't know how they find it.;Q. Ruth S. Montgomery, Hearst Newspapers: Mr. President, why is it that we are able to build submarines that will go under the North Pole and we can build--we can send mice and apes into orbit, but we can't find anybody who can air-condition this room? [Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. Well, you know, I'll tell you frankly, I think you people can make yourselves one pressure group that I'd have great sympathy with. [Laughter];Q. Edward P. Morgan, American Broadcasting Company: Mr. President, last night former Secretary of State Acheson in a speech charged your administration's military spending policies are endangering the security of the country, and he called for an additional $7.5 billion in annual defense expenditures, not necessarily deficit, for 4 or 5 years, boosting ground forces and an immediate crash effort to bridge the missile gap.;Now, you may not want to comment on your policy, on that speech, but would you say how much you think defense is going to be an issue in the 1960 political campaign?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think if defense is an issue, it will at least show this: in the last 6 Ѕ years, it has been able to keep anybody else from attacking us.;Q. Robert G. Spivack, New York Post: Getting back to Vice President Nixon's visit to Moscow, at the same time that your brother's visit was announced, there were some newspaper stories and some interpretations that sending your brother along was an attempt to minimize or knock down the significance, political significance, of the Vice President's trip, and just now you said that the Vice President had asked your brother to come along.;THE PRESIDENT. That's correct.;Q. Mr. Spivack: I wonder if you can tell us how it all came about.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, because he just asked my brother to go along and they both asked me whether I thought it would be a good idea, and I said sure. Period.;Q. Ray L. Scherer, NBC News: What sort of an impression did you get of Mr. Kozlov and his place in the Russian scheme of things from your visit to New York?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, of course in most of the personal visits with representatives of the Soviet Government, you find that you have had a rather pleasant personal experience. They are outgiving, they apparently like to have fun, they appreciate a joke, they see humor in a number of things and so, by this standard, and I mean in this, you might say in this habit, I found a man that was very friendly, and frankly I enjoyed the visit I had with him.;It was entirely personal, it was not political. He showed me with a great deal of interest and I think justifiable pride the many items they had to show in their exhibition, and I think it will attract the eye and interest of anybody.;I am looking forward to my visit with him this morning, I think it's at 11:15. I don't know what we are going to talk about--it's a meeting without agenda, but whatever we talk about, I am sure it will be a little bit more serious than that one.;Q. J. F. Ter Horst, Detroit News: Sir, this week the Supreme Court ruled out of bounds the Nation's industrial security clearance program on the grounds that neither Congress nor the executive branch had authorized it. I wonder, sir, if you could tell us whether you feel the continuation of this program is vital to the country, and also whether you would prefer to have Congress initiate the authorization or whether you will do so?;THE PRESIDENT. As quickly as that decision was handed down, our people were directed to begin a study of it. It is one of those things, because they made it on these sole grounds that authority had not been delegated. I don't know what further decisions would be made if we did so delegate it or did attempt it. So I think it will have to be studied and then an answer reached.;Q. Frank van der Linden, Nashville Banner: Sir, in view of the Senate's rejection of Admiral Strauss as Secretary of Commerce, after this long ordeal, are you having much trouble finding a successor in his Cabinet post?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'll just say this: that anyone having gone through what Mr. Strauss has gone through stands as sort of an example to someone else, and someone else may take a long look.;I have not been one of those people that has found any difficulty in getting people to take positions merely because of financial sacrifice. I have found a great readiness, and I have heard, just, you might say casual comment of the kind you are now discussing, but that's all.;Q. Stewart Hensley, United Press International: A little more on Mr. Kozlov. You said you expect your talk with him in a few minutes to be a little more serious than the New York visit. He said when he arrived here yesterday that he hoped his talks with you and with others here would lead to getting rid of some of what he called the abnormalities in the Russian-American situation.;Do you have any suggestion for him as to how this can be done, or is the ball on his side of the court?;THE PRESIDENT. I suppose that in such a situation, each side rather thinks the other has some new or additional responsibility. We have, as our position, that described by Mr. Herter here a few nights ago after he came back from Geneva, when he said there are only two or three basic principles which mark a minimum position in, you might say, our readiness for negotiation, everything else, we try to be flexible in and we certainly will attempt to promote and develop some ideas that we hope will be fruitful.;But, of course, in this one or two basic things which I have so often repeated, why, of course, we cannot recede.;Q. Sarah McClendon, Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader: Mr. President, sir, I wonder what we are going to do about this arms situation down in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, in view of the fact that we probably have supplied the arms and ammunition that they may be getting ready to shoot at each other, and also in view of the fact that there seems to be ample argument for the claims that there is Communist infiltration in some of these armed forces.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think that if America is going to be true to itself and to its pledges, that it must depend primarily upon the Organization of American States to take cognizance of these difficulties, and if they can find any reason for action, that they are the ones that must recommend it.;The United States, as I have so often said, tries to maintain friendly relations with friendly governments. There is no sense of closing our eyes to some of the situations of the current time in Central America and in the Caribbean. But we do look primarily to the Organization of American States to take the initiative, otherwise we again would be called the dollar imperialists or something else of that kind.;Q. John Scali, Associated Press: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko a few days ago denied that Russia had any ambitions to annex West Berlin. He professed to see some evidence at Geneva that both sides were getting closer together, and he again reiterated the need for a summit conference.;What do you think of these views?;THE PRESIDENT. Well I think he said this before, and until there is something that you can identify as either progress through deeds or a readiness of presenting an agenda which, in itself, would be negotiated by, let's say, heads of state, I don't quite see the reason for his conclusion.;Q. Richard L. Wilson, Cowles Publications: You referred, sir, to the growing interest in the nominations for candidates for President in 1960--;THE PRESIDENT. No, someone else referred to it. [Laughter];Q. Mr. Wilson: I wondered if you considered yourself neutral in this discussion?;THE PRESIDENT. Well I think it would be too much to think that a man's sentiments and ideas were completely neutral. I have said time and again that the Republican Party, in my opinion, has brought forward a group of able, capable men of vigorous years and that any could be selected with honor to himself and to the party.;But, I certainly shall never, so far as I am able, indicate publicly to anyone, or privately, to the details of the procedures well, that will bring about some nominee, because I don't think it is correct or right.;Q. Raymond P. Brandt, St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Do you agree with Vice President Nixon that the main issue in the 1960 campaign will be inflation?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I didn't know he had said that, but certainly it will be one of them. Of course, I tried to bring it to the Congress in 1958, and I said we simply couldn't go on with irresponsible spending. I gave instance after instance of bills that I thought would have required just unconscionable spending. The decision at the polls was not one, at that moment, to lead me to believe that people were too much concerned by inflation. But I think they have changed their minds.;Q. Mr. Brandt: There has been a written report, a newspaper report, that there is a secret or confidential Government document that prices will increase 3 percent during 1960.;THE PRESIDENT. What's that?;Q. Mr. Brandt: There has been a confidential Government report that the price index will rise 3 percent in 1960. Have you seen such a report?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Q. Spencer Davis, Associated Press: In this connection, sir, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has cut down the size of the military assistance which you have requested rather considerably and at the same time increased the amount of economic assistance to other countries, saying that $500 million will be sufficient for the critical areas of Formosa, Korea, and Viet-Nam and the rest could more or less take care of itself.;Would you say what you believe, what you think of this?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I can say only this: I agree with the idea implicit in their recommendation, which is that the struggle has become far broader than it was in the early days when we thought of the matter merely as the use of force or the threat of force to throw us off balance. They have got into the economic and the cultural and propaganda fields I think very much more strongly than was formerly the case. But with respect to this matter of military assistance, I sent the question very recently again to the Chiefs of Staff and I said, "I want to know whether you, with your combined military opinion, believe that this sum that I put in, $1.6 billion, is sufficient.;I can't remember the exact words in which the reply came back, but the $1.6 billion in their opinion was not only the minimum that we dared to use if we were really concerned about the security of our country, but they implied that since that sum would necessarily have to be augmented by what is left of the once big pipeline, that we would have to do more in 1961.;Marvin L. Arrowsmith, Associated Press: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Eisenhower: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">August 17, 1960</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good morning. Please sit down.;I had a few questions about the accomplishments of the Space Agency over the past week, and so I had a short memorandum prepared this morning that will be available at Mr. Hagerty's office if any of you want them. It lists the unusual accomplishments of the week. 1;Any questions?;1 See item 264.;Q. frank Eleazer, United Press International: Mr. President, Francis Powers, the U-2 pilot, pleaded guilty today to spying. Does this indicate to you in any way that he may have been brainwashed or do you have any other comments, sir, on the conduct of the trial so far?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, no, it doesn't show evidence that he has been brainwashed. The only thing I would like to comment on would be the past history of the case.;Under international usage--custom--any foreigner who is accused of a crime in any country has been accorded the right to see counsel of his own choosing and to see interested consuls or people of that kind of the other government. In this case, of course, Mr. Powers has been given no such privilege and we have asked that he should have it.;Now, in the actual conduct of the trial, as it goes on, I would have no comment because it certainly wouldn't be helpful to Mr. Powers' case for anyone in my position to be commenting on the conduct of a trial in that other country.;Q. Ray L. Scherer, National Broadcasting Company: Mr. President, a number of us talked to Mr. Dirksen and Mr. Halleck after they conferred with you yesterday, and they said that generally they don't look for much from this post-Convention session of Congress. Some of us got the impression that Republican strategy will be to label this a "do-little" Congress. Is that he way you see it, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, that is the first time that I have heard that word "do-little" Congress and I didn't--I suppose they were speaking as legislators, and possibly from past experience. You know, strangely enough, someone called my attention to the fact that the Congress passed in 2 weeks last year 436 bills. And now we have a program that was not only presented last January for consideration during these past some 7 or 8 months, but it has been repeated to the Congress in messages of various kinds during the time. This is not a new program. It is one that was presented some months back. And I don't see any reason why there shouldn't be some action.;Q. Lloyd M. Schwartz, Fairchild Publications: Mr. President, in the closing months of any administration, the President usually has the problem of persuading people not to leave their posts and go back to their private businesses. I wonder if you are having that problem already, or anticipate having it soon?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I haven't in any--there certainly has been no volume of it. I remember one of my staff was offered a different position, and he accepted, with my blessing. But I have always done that, and I have seen no great influx of letters of resignation at the moment.;Q. Chalmers M. Roberts, Washington Post: Mr. President, since the Democrats do not seem disposed to enact any, or much, of your 21-point program, are you considering at all the possibility that you might call Congress back into session before the elections, or do you prefer to leave the issue to the voters in November?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, Mr. Roberts, I think it would be a very unwise thing to call a special session of Congress under the atmosphere in which we are now living, unless actual emergency demands it. If Congress doesn't want to act now, what would be the point in bringing them back?;If we are thinking of the public interest and not just of political maneuvering, why, there can be done what needs to be done. Then if the voters are dissatisfied with either side, why, they can make their views known.;Q. Edward P. Morgan, American Broadcasting Company: Mr. President, this is a question about your project for an emergency fund for the Congo and Africa, which the Senate foreign Relations Committee approved yesterday. Do you think that a case can be made, particularly at this juncture, for use of some of those funds through the United Nations, or does the administration think it would be wiser and easier to spend the money independently?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I wouldn't want to comment in such detailed fashion about this question that I would appear to set up a new policy on the spur of the moment. Actually, I believe that we must depend on the United Nations to take the leadership in meeting these situations as they arise. Actually, there haven't been too many of them, you know, when you stop to think that, I believe, with the six nations now soon to come into existence we have got something like 34 or 35 coming into existence since World War II. And in many--most cases--these transitions have been accomplished not only peacefully but in such ways that a certain degree of stability has been achieved almost at once. Here we have had the unfortunate spectacle of disorder and disruption of governmental processes occurring. The United Nations ought to take the lead, and we support it. Therefore, if some of the funds that we have to give to this place go through them, it will be, I think, a proper way to do it.;Q. Mr. Morgan: How do you envision, sir, the use of those funds in other ways? The funds that would not go through the United Nations-how do you expect them to be applied?;THE PRESIDENT. You will recall, I think it says not merely the Congo, but in the other areas of Africa. So you couldn't always do it through the United Nations, because the United Nations probably wouldn't have taken any cognizance of the need expressed to us by that nation.;I would think each one would have to be decided on its merits as it came up. But I think if you will read Mr. Dillon's statement in detail, the one he made before the Committee the other day, it was very explanatory.;Q. Felix Belair, New York Times: Mr. President, you spoke a moment ago of the U.N. taking the lead in Africa with our support. What will you do, if you can say, sir--what do we do when U.N. troops are arrested over there and also do you have any correspondence on this?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, this last incident--you mean when Lumumba arrested some of them and then released them? Well, you have got conditions that are deplorable, and there seem to be many actions taken impulsively. I still say this: the United Nations must shoulder its responsibilities in such matters, and we must support them. And I think that the vast bulk of the free nations will feel exactly as we do about this. Now, this doesn't mean that things are always going to be easy, and we are not going to have such incidents as occurred the other day--or yesterday, I guess it was. But I think that on the whole, the record of the United Nations gives a great deal of promise that it can continue to handle matters like this expeditiously.;Q. Mrs. May Craig, Portland (Maine) Press Herald: Mr. President, regardless of whether Congress did or didn't do what it should since January, do you think it is possible for them now to deal with all of your more than a score of points when the time is so short, or do you think that they should go out and explain their future policies and platforms to the voters between now and November?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have a Congress of the United States, set up in the Constitution, to pass the laws that are seemingly needed for the United States. And under that system we have developed the two-party system. We have now in each House of Congress a two-thirds majority. And as a matter of fact, from my viewpoint at least, such of this legislation as is constructive, and I believe those that I have recommended are supported by the Republican group, I see no reason why you couldn't get a lot of action, particularly when, as I pointed out, there were 436 bills passed in 2 weeks last year.;Q. Robert C. Pierpoint, CBS News: Mr. President, I wonder if you have some kind of a priority among these 21 proposals that you could list for us.;THE PRESIDENT. No, no. Actually, after having put these things before the Congress, the Congress will have to decide what it is going to do and what it is not going to do.;Q. Peter Lisagor, Chicago Daily News: Suggestions were made in the Senate this week that perhaps it would be wise to devise a program, a multibillion-dollar program, for Latin American aid, something on the concept of the Marshall plan. Can you tell us how you would feel about such a program?;THE PRESIDENT. The Marshall plan was developed for a specific purpose. This specific purpose was the restoration of a damaged and, in some cases, destroyed industrial fabric in Western Europe--mostly in Western Europe. Now, this was--this had, in other words, a foreseeable terminating date because it had a specific objective.;When you go into the problem of helping people raising living standards, this has no foreseeable end at the moment, it is a thing that has to be studied year by year, adapted, changed to meet changing conditions, and this is an entirely different thing. I don't believe any man is wise enough today to foresee what will be the ultimate need and set up the program and the money to meet it. I think that this is the kind of thing where a family of nations, like a family of individuals, have to understand they live together, and in living together, new needs come up. And if they are met cooperatively by everybody putting his brains and his resources into it, we will get somewhere. But I don't believe that any nation could at this moment, for all the other 20, say, "We will put x billion dollars, and here is a program, and if you do this you will be all right." I don't believe that for a minute.;Q. Lambert Brose, Lutheran Layman: Mr. President, there has been some criticism in the press of the hopeful signs you gave of our economy at last week's news conference. And Newsweek magazine has taken some of the Government statistics you quoted and shows that, according to Newsweek, that they are not so favorable. May I quote several of them to you?;THE PRESIDENT. It's all right with me. [Laughter];Q. Mr. Brose: You said last week: "Retail sales continue to go up at a record," and Newsweek says, "Total retail sales dropped during July to 18.3 billion, lowest level in 3 months. It is no higher than it was a year ago, despite rising population and rising prices.;And then you said last week: "Right now, they are building houses at a rate of 1.3 million, which is, I think with one exception, as high as we have ever been." Newsweek says: "Home builders are in fact having their worst year, with one exception, since 1954.;And one more--[laughter]--I just want to mention. You stated: "Employment is almost 69 million, another record." Newsweek says: "Unemployment, which the President didn't mention, is over 4 million, a high 5.4 percent of the labor force.;My question is: do you think--[laughter]--the public may have received a slightly more favorable outlook of the economy at last week's press conference than really is justified?;THE PRESIDENT. Allowing for the possibility that any man can always misspeak himself a little bit, I don't admit that I made any error. But I will tell you: you are talking now about a quarrel between Newsweek and the Council of Economic Advisers, and I ask you to go and meet them, and see what they have to say about it. [Laughter];Q. Edward T. Folliard, Washington Post: Mr. President, last week you were asked about your role in the campaign. As I remember it, you said that you would do whatever you could to help the Nixon-Lodge ticket, but you didn't think it would be wise to go out on the hustings. And since then, it has been announced that you are going to make a couple of nonpolitical speeches. What is your reasoning there, Mr. President, that nonpolitical speeches, so called, would be more helpful to the Nixon-Lodge ticket? I was a little puzzled.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, certainly I wouldn't want to hurt that ticket, because I think it is fine. But let's get this thing straight.;There becomes a division of responsibility with respect to the future-you might say the political future of this country--that must be obvious to everybody. I necessarily remain as President of the United States, and I am responsible for every decision taken up, as I say, until January 20, on the actions of this Government.;Now, there is a political campaign up, when by Constitution I am no longer included. I am just a spectator in a way. Therefore, the direction of the political campaign as such--not the Government, but the political campaign--falls into other hands.;Now, they come to me, because after all we have been working together a long time, and they do realize that what I do will have some definite influence on that election. Then they will tell me what they want done.;What I am saying is that I have already accepted, oh, months back, some engagements--like I am going up to speak for my old friend, Cardinal Spellman, in the Catholic Church. I guess we have announced this, haven't we?;Mr. Hagerty: Yes, sir.;THE PRESIDENT. And in Philadelphia, and places like that. Now, what I would do otherwise, I know that there is one--there is one performance coming in where I am going to be part of the political picture, and make a political speech. I don't know how many. But they will give me their ideas, and if I agree, why, that is exactly what I will do, because I am going to do whatever I can to elect Mr. Nixon and Mr. Lodge, you can bet on that.;Q. David Kraslow, Knight Newspapers: Mr. President, this administration has prided itself on being budget conscious, yet it is sponsoring a medical care program for the aged that will make a sizable dent in the general Treasury, while the Democratic leadership, which has been criticized in the past on spending issues, is sponsoring a so-called self-funding plan, pay as you go, as they put it. Will you comment on that, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I say this. I am for a plan that will be truly helpful to the aged, particularly against illnesses which become so expensive, but one that is freely accepted by the individual. I am against compulsory medicine, and that is exactly what I am against, and I don't care if that does cost the Treasury a little bit more money there. But after all, the price of freedom is not always measured just in dollars.;Q. Sarah McClendon, Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader: Mr. President, I presume from the reappointments in the State Department that you have taken some look recently at the background and actions of--both actions and policy in the State Department on the things that brought about the Communist encroachment in Cuba. Now, I wonder if from your look at that, if you have found mistakes that were made, and if you would tell us who were making the mistakes?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, you must be asking for some kind of white paper--[laughter]--that will tell everything that we have ever done in Cuba. I have not heard of any circumstances that would justify the question you have just asked. And I know of no blunder which I can attach blame to anyone for. Therefore--and I have had these reports on Cuba every day, I think, for the last month, either by telephone or personally--I don't know of any reason for apologizing for what we have done in the past.;Q. Mrs. McClendon: Well, sir, may I--;THE PRESIDENT. No, thank you.;Q. E. W. Kenworthy, New York Times: A further question, sir, on aid to Latin America. While the situations confronting the Marshall plan countries and Latin America are quite different, would it be helpful if the Latin American countries would set up an equivalent organization to the--;THE PRESIDENT. Would set up a what?;Q. Mr. Kenworthy:--an equivalent organization to the OEEC, which the Marshall plan countries have, to help plan the aid they want?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I wouldn't be too quick to give a specific answer on this. I think it would be good. And I am speaking personally, and not having discussed this particular point with others--very competent people in this field. I am sure of this: that the OAS must provide a mechanism where this whole development is going to be on a cooperative basis, and where there is the actual decision made on a group basis, because if it is made unilaterally, and we pretend to be the great experts on Latin America, and everything that we say is to be done and nothing else, then it will not work. It has got to be a very cooperative effort, and if it is an organization something as we developed in the OEEC, why, fine.;Q. Paul Martin, Gannett Newspapers: Mr. President, Marion Folsom said the other day that, on this health bill, Congress should not act this year in a political atmosphere. He suggested that we appoint a study commission, composed of representatives of the insurance industry, medical profession, employers, labor, and so on, with instructions to report next year, and let the next administration and the next Congress, with the basis of facts, determine what they should do. What do you think about that idea?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, first of all, I have great admiration for Marion Folsom. Secondly, I very thoroughly believe in a thorough analysis of all the facts that we can find in such thing--in such affairs, in such vast pro- grams, before we take action.;Now, the fact is that there has been an awful lot of study. We have conferred with the American Medical Association, with the insurance companies, and everybody that seemed to have an authoritative voice in this matter.;And I am not adverse to the studies. I doubt that you ever get a really favorable year to do anything as difficult. People say it is either election year or it is not an election year. Either one seems to be a good excuse for not doing anything. But the fact is that if such studies would give us a better and clearer idea, why, of course, I would have no objections. But I do believe that something ought to be done now, because these people are truly in need for this kind of support and help.;Q. Spencer Davis, Associated Press: Would you say, sir, how the situation in Laos looks to you now, and if you contemplate any need to pull out American aid and military missions in that country?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, Laos is a very confused situation. Of course, the new prime minister is getting ready to present his newly established government to the Assembly, and that is about the only development since last week. And I can say only this: that both in Laos and here in Washington we are following the situation just as earnestly as we can, and certainly to take any kind of action that seems to be indicated.;Q. John V. Homer, Washington Star: Mr. President, now that the American foreign ministers are in session, what do you think that they should do, or what would you like to see them do., about Cuba?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think that they are brought together there to study everything that is of interest, and particularly that seems to disturb the public opinion in all the Americas, from here on southward. Both by the report made to the foreign--to the Council--yesterday, both Trujillo, the Dominican problem, and the Cuban problem are cited as two of the items which they must study, and decide among themselves what to do. And further than that, I would not want to comment, because I am quite clear in my mind that these matters are for all the states of the OAS. It is not merely because we have had some specific problems and difficulties in these areas. This does not make it our problem alone. If we can't solve it on a cooperative and general basis, then indeed it would look quite bad.;Q. Lillian Levy, Science Service: Mr. President, there have been reports, sir, that there is some feeling among our allies that an agreement on the cessation of nuclear tests cannot be achieved between East and West before the end of your administration. What is your appraisal of the possibility of an agreement between now and January?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, of course the history of the whole thing doesn't seem too good, for the simple reason that we have been working so hard on this thing up to now. And I would say this: nothing could gratify me more than to achieve, between the East and West, some agreement that would bring a bit more of peace of mind to all our people, and would do so by making certain that that agreement could be policed on both sides-that is, inspected and kept everybody up to snuff.;Q. Frank van der Linden, Nashville Banner: Mr. President, the polls are now beginning to show that Vice President Nixon is pulling ahead of Mr. Kennedy in the presidential race, and his press secretary says he now has closed the gap, and they are running neck to neck. I wonder, sir, if you have any advice to Mr. Nixon's friends and the Republicans not to get a little overconfident as was done in 1948, and maybe keep working.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I wasn't here in '48. But I would say this: in any competitive enterprise, whether it is war or politics or anything else, no one should be pessimistic or discouraged by some straw in the wind, and certainly he should not be complacent with another straw that seems to point favorably in his direction. I am quite sure that Mr. Nixon is correct when he says he is starting a fight as rapidly as he can, and he is going to wage it right down to the last minute of the campaign, because I think he is too old a campaigner to take anything for granted.;Q. John M. Hightower, Associated Press: I would like to raise the question of the Powers case again, sir. The major Soviet propaganda line in connection with this case is that the United States itself is on trial. I wondered whether you had occasion to give this matter some thought, and what your reaction is to this line.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't think it is, whatsoever. When we admitted publicly that the U-2 belonged to us and that it was on a reconnaissance mission, we were doing something that in a modern world was the only way we could find out, to get any information, about a closed society, and a society that is constantly threatening us by their strength, boasting about what they could do to the world, and all the rest of it.;Now, this does not put the United States on trial whatsoever. If they want to say that they are putting me on trial, that is their privilege. But to put the United States on trial in this way is just another piece of their propaganda that distorts fact into their own line of charge and allegation.;Q. Benjamin R. Cole, Indianapolis Star: Mr. President, in connection with that, if the Soviets put the President of the United States on trial, how, then, can they put an American citizen on trial for carrying out a mission under the command of his Commander in Chief?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, they can't put him on trial, because they can't take jurisdiction in the sense that you are speaking. What they are trying-they are trying to say that they are condemning the United States before world opinion. Well, I think they have no case whatsoever. The number of spies that we have caught, and cases of bribery and subversion, which have been proved all over the world, gives their--just denies any validity whatsoever to this kind of a charge on their part.;Jack Ball, Associated Press: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Eisenhower: Special Message to the Congress on the Sugar Quota of the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">August 23, 1960</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;The meeting of foreign Ministers of the American Republics at San Jose, Costa Rica, has just completed its deliberations on the charges made against the Dominican Republic by the Government of Venezuela, as well as on the flagrant violation of human rights by the Trujillo regime. The foreign Ministers voted unanimously to condemn the Dominican acts of aggression and intervention against Venezuela, culminating in the attempt on the life of the President of that country, and resolved to (1) break diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic, and (2) interrupt partially economic relations with that country beginning with a suspension of trade in arms and implements of war, with the provision that the Council of the Organization of American States shall study the feasibility and desirability of extending this trade suspension to other articles. The United States joined with the other American Republics in approving these measures.;Some 322,000 short tons of the sugar not being purchased from Cuba pursuant to the reduction in the Cuban quota is, under the July amendment to the Sugar Act, to be allocated to the Dominican Republic. This allocation is in addition to the Dominican Republic's 1960 quota amounting to approximately 130,000 tons. Since total imports of sugar from the Dominican Republic in 1959 amounted only to about 84,000 tons, the statutory allocation would give that country a large sugar bonus seriously embarrassing to the United States in the conduct of our foreign relations throughout the hemisphere.;In view of the foregoing considerations, the Government should have discretion to purchase elsewhere the quantity apportioned to the Dominican Republic pursuant to the July Amendment to the Sugar Act. I therefore request legislation providing that amounts which would be purchased in the Dominican Republic pursuant to the July Amendment need not be purchased there, but may be purchased from any foreign countries without regard to. allocation.;I would also remind the Congress that the Sugar Act's present termination date of March 31, 1961--only three months after the reconvening of Congress next January--could cause a serious gap in supplies, because it often takes as much as one or two months after purchase for sugar from distant areas to reach our refineries. Thus an extension of the Sugar Act beyond its present termination date is necessary at this session in order to protect consumers in the United States against the possibility of unreasonable prices for sugar next February and March.;I request that the Congress give urgent consideration to and take favorable action on the proposed legislation.;DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER</td></tr>

The proclamation expresses my finding that such action is in the national interest of the United States. It is applicable to imports of Cuban sugar through March;31, 1961, the expiration date of the present Sugar Act.;Since my proclamation of July 6 of this year the Government of Cuba has continued to follow a policy of deliberate hostility toward the United States and to commit steadily increasing amounts of its sugar crop to Communist countries. This further confirms the view I expressed at that time that the United States cannot now rely upon Cuba to supply a large part of the sugar needs of American consumers.;To replace supplies normally obtained from Cuba, the Department of Agriculture will shortly authorize the importation of non-quota sugar from other countries. These authorizations will be made in accordance with the formula laid down in the present Sugar Act as amended.;Despite my urgent recommendations to the contrary, Congress has provided that one of the countries from which replacement sugar must be purchased under this Act is the Dominican Republic. In view of the unanimous condemnation of the present Government of the Dominican Republic by the Organization of American States, replacement sugar purchases from that country will continue to be subject to special import fees. When the new Congress convenes next month I shall again recommend that it relieve the Executive from the obligation to purchase such sugar from the Dominican Republic.</td></tr>

I have also indicated my belief that a nine-months extension is imperative to maintain a stable sugar market in the interest of domestic producers and consumers, if the Congress is to have time enough to develop longer range legislation.;In accordance with my statement of December 16, 1960, I have again asked the Congress to relieve the Executive of the obligation to purchase from the Dominican Republic a portion of the sugar needed to replace that formerly obtained from Cuba.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Address at a White House Reception for Members of Congress and for the Diplomatic Corps of the Latin American Republics.</td><td class="c6">March 13, 1961</td><td class="c7">IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE for Mrs. Kennedy and for me, for the Vice President and Mrs. Johnson, and for the Members of Congress, to welcome the Ambassadorial Corps of our Hemisphere, our long time friends, to the White House today. One hundred and thirty-nine years ago this week the United States, stirred by the heroic struggle of its fellow Americans, urged the independence and recognition of the new Latin American Republics. It was then, at the dawn of freedom throughout this hemisphere, that Bolivar spoke of his desire to see the Americas fashioned into the greatest region in the world, "greatest," he said, "not so much by virtue of her area and her wealth, as by her freedom and her glory.;Never in the long history of our hemisphere has this dream been nearer to fulfillment, and never has it been in greater danger.;The genius of our scientists has given us the tools to bring abundance to our land, strength to our industry, and knowledge to our people. For the first time we have the capacity to strike off the remaining bonds of poverty and ignorance--to free our people for the spiritual and intellectual fulfillment which has always been the goal of our civilization.;Yet at this very moment of maximum opportunity, we confront the same forces which have imperiled America throughout its history--the alien forces which once again seek to impose the despotisms of the Old World on the people of the New.;I have asked you to come here today so that I might discuss these challenges and these dangers.;We meet together as firm and ancient friends, united by history and experience and by our determination to advance the values of American civilization. For this New World of ours is not a mere accident of geography. Our continents are bound together by a common history, the endless exploration of new frontiers. Our nations are the product of a common struggle, the revolt from colonial rule. And our people share a common heritage, the quest for the dignity and the freedom of man.;The revolutions which gave us birth ignited, in the words of Thomas Paine, "a spark never to be extinguished." And across vast, turbulent continents these American ideals still stir man's struggle for national independence and individual freedom. But as we welcome the spread of the American revolution to other lands, we must also remember that our own struggle--the revolution which began in Philadelphia in 1776, and in Caracas in 1811--is not yet finished. Our hemisphere's mission is not yet completed. For our unfulfilled task is to demonstrate to the entire world that man's unsatisfied aspiration for economic progress and social justice can best be achieved by free men working within a framework of democratic institutions. If we can do this in our own hemisphere, and for our own people, we may yet realize the prophecy of the great Mexican patriot, Benito Juarez, that "democracy is the destiny of future humanity.;As a citizen of the United States let me be the first to admit that we North Americans have not always grasped the significance of this common mission, just as it is also true that many in your own countries have not fully understood the urgency of the need to lift people from poverty and ignorance and despair. But we must turn from these mistakes from the failures and the misunderstandings of the past to a future full of peril, but bright with hope.;Throughout Latin America, a continent rich in resources and in the spiritual and cultural achievements of its people, millions of men and women suffer the daily degradations of poverty and hunger. They lack decent shelter or protection from disease. Their children are deprived of the education or the jobs which are the gateway to a better life. And each day the problems grow more urgent. Population growth is outpacing economic growth--low living standards are further endangered--and discontent--the discontent of a people who know that abundance and the tools of progress are at last within their reach--that discontent is growing. In the words of Jose Figueres, "once dormant peoples are struggling upward toward the sun, toward a better life.;If we are to meet a problem so staggering in its dimensions, our approach must itself be equally bold--an approach consistent with the majestic concept of Operation Pan America. Therefore I have called on all people of the hemisphere to join in a new Alliance for Progress--Alianza para Progreso--a vast cooperative effort, unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs of the American people for homes, work and land, health and schools--techo, trabajo y tierra, salud y escuela;First, I propose that the American Republics begin on a vast new Ten Year Plan for the Americas, a plan to transform the 1960's into a historic decade of democratic progress.;These 10 years will be the years of maximum progress-maximum effort, the years when the greatest obstacles must be overcome, the years when the need for assistance will be the greatest.;And if we are successful, if our effort is bold enough and determined enough, then the close of this decade will mark the beginning of a new era in the American experience. The living standards of every American family will be on the rise, basic education will be available to all, hunger will be a forgotten experience, the need for massive outside help will have passed, most nations will have entered a period of self-sustaining growth, and though there will be still much to do, every American Republic will be the master of its own revolution and its own hope and progress.;Let me stress that only the most determined efforts of the American nations themselves can bring success to this effort. They, and they alone, can mobilize their resources, enlist the energies of their people, and modify their social patterns so that all, and not just a privileged few, share in the fruits of growth. If this effort is made, then outside assistance will give vital impetus to progress, without it, no amount of help will advance the welfare of the people.;Thus if the countries of Latin America are ready to do their part, and I am sure they are, then I believe the United States, for its part, should help provide resources of a scope and magnitude sufficient to make this bold development plan a success--just as we helped to provide, against equal odds nearly, the resources adequate to help rebuild the economies of Western Europe. For only an effort of towering dimensions can ensure fulfillment of our plan for a decade of progress.;Secondly, I will shortly request a ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council, a meeting at which we can begin the massive planning effort which will be at the heart of the Alliance for Progress.;For if our Alliance is to succeed, each Latin nation must formulate long-range plans for its own development, plans which establish targets and priorities, ensure monetary stability, establish the machinery for vital social change, stimulate private activity and initiative, and provide for a maximum national effort. These plans will be the foundation of our development effort, and the basis for the allocation of outside resources.;A greatly strengthened IA-ECOSOC, working with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Inter-American Development Bank, can assemble the leading economists and experts of the hemisphere to help each country develop its own development plan--and provide a continuing review of economic progress in this hemisphere.;Third, I have this evening signed a request to the Congress for $500 million as a first step in fulfilling the Act of Bogota. This is the first large-scale Inter-American effort, instituted by my predecessor President Eisenhower, to attack the social barriers which block economic progress. The money will be used to combat illiteracy, improve the productivity and use of their land, wipe out disease, attack archaic tax and land tenure structures, provide educational opportunities, and offer a broad range of projects designed to make the benefits of increasing abundance available to all. We will begin to commit these funds as soon as they are appropriated.;Fourth, we must support all economic integration which is a genuine step toward larger markets and greater competitive opportunity. The fragmentation of Latin American economies is a serious barrier to industrial growth. Projects such as the Central American common market and free trade areas in South America can help to remove these obstacles.;Fifth, the United States is ready to cooperate in serious, case-by-case examinations of commodity market problems. Frequent violent change in commodity prices seriously injure the economies of many Latin American countries, draining their resources and stultifying their growth. Together we must find practical methods of bringing an end to this pattern.;Sixth, we will immediately step up our Food for Peace emergency program, help establish food reserves in areas of recurrent drought, help provide school lunches for children, and offer feed grains for use in rural development. For hungry men and women cannot wait for economic discussions or diplomatic meetings--their need is urgent--and their hunger rests heavily on the conscience of their fellow men.;Seventh, all the people of the hemisphere must be allowed to share in the expanding wonders of science--wonders which have captured man's imagination, challenged the powers of his mind, and given him the tools for rapid progress. I invite Latin American scientists to work with us in new projects in fields such as medicine and agriculture, physics and astronomy, and desalinization, to help plan for regional research laboratories in these and other fields, and to strengthen cooperation between American universities and laboratories.;We also intend to expand our science teacher training programs to include Latin American instructors, to assist in establishing such programs in other American countries, and translate and make available revolutionary new teaching materials in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics, so that the young of all nations may contribute their skills to the advance of science.;Eighth, we must rapidly expand the training of those needed to man the economies of rapidly developing countries. This means expanded technical training programs, for which the Peace Corps, for example, will be available when needed. It also means assistance to Latin American universities, graduate schools, and research institutes.;We welcome proposals in Central America for intimate cooperation in higher education--cooperation which can achieve a regional effort of increased effectiveness and excellence. We are ready to help fill the gap in trained manpower, realizing that our ultimate goal must be a basic education for all who wish to learn.;Ninth, we reaffirm our pledge to come to the defense of any American nation whose independence is endangered. As its confidence in the collective security system of the OAS spreads, it will be possible to devote to constructive use a major share of those resources now spent on the instruments of war. Even now, as the government of Chile has said, the time has come to take the first steps toward sensible limitations of arms. And the new generation of military leaders has shown an increasing awareness that armies cannot only defend their countries--they can, as we have learned through our own Corps of Engineers, they can help to build them.;Tenth, we invite our friends in Latin America to contribute to the enrichment of life and culture in the United States. We need teachers of your literature and history and tradition, opportunities for our young people to study in your universities, access to your music, your art, and the thought of your great philosophers. For we know we have much to learn.;In this way you can help bring a fuller spiritual and intellectual life to the people of the United States--and contribute to understanding and mutual respect among the nations of the hemisphere.;With steps such as these, we propose to complete the revolution of the Americas, to build a hemisphere where all men can hope for a suitable standard of living, and all can live out their lives in dignity and in freedom.;To achieve this goal political freedom must accompany material progress. Our Alliance for Progress is an alliance of free governments, and it must work to eliminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it has no rightful place. Therefore let us express our special friendship to the people of Cuba and the Dominican Republic--and the hope they will soon rejoin the society of free men, uniting with us in common effort.;This political freedom must be accompanied by social change. For unless necessary social reforms, including land and tax reform, are freely made--unless we broaden the opportunity for all of our people--unless the great mass of Americans share in increasing prosperity--then our alliance, our revolution, our dream, and our freedom will fail. But we call for social change by free men-change in the spirit of Washington and Jefferson, of Bolivar and San Martin and Martin--not change which seeks to impose on men tyrannies which we cast out a century and a half ago. Our motto is what it has always been--progress yes, tyranny no-progreso si, tirania no!;But our greatest challenge comes from within--the task of creating an American civilization where spiritual and cultural values are strengthened by an ever-broadening base of material advance--where, within the rich diversity of its own traditions, each nation is free to follow its own path towards progress.;The completion of our task will, of course, require the efforts of all governments of our hemisphere. But the efforts of governments alone will never be enough. In the end, the people must choose and the people must help themselves.;And so I say to the men and women of the Americas--to the campesino in the fields, to the obrero in the cities, to the estudiante in the schools--prepare your mind and heart for the task ahead--call forth your strength and let each devote his energies to the betterment of all, so that your children and our children in this hemisphere can find an ever richer and a freer life.;Let us once again transform the American continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary ideas and efforts--a tribute to the power of the creative energies of free men and women--an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk hand in hand. Let us once again awaken our American revolution until it guides the struggle of people everywhere--not with an imperialism of force or fear--but the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Address at the University of North Carolina Upon Receiving an Honorary Degree.</td><td class="c6">October 12, 1961</td><td class="c7">Mr. Chancellor, Governor Sanford, members of the faculty, ladies and gentlemen;I am honored today to be admitted to the fellowship of this ancient and distinguished university, and I am pleased to receive in the short space of 1 or 2 minutes the honor for which you spend over 4 years of your lives. But whether the degree be honorary or earned, it is a proud symbol of this university and this State.;North Carolina has long been identified with enlightened and progressive leaders and people, and I can think of no more important reason for that reputation than this university, which year after year has sent educated men and women who have had a recognition of their public responsibility as well as in their private interests.;Distinguished Presidents like President Graham and Gray, distinguished leaders like the Secretary of Commerce, Governor Hodges, distinguished members of the congressional delegation, carry out a tradition which stretches back to the beginning of this school, and that is that the graduate of this university is a man of his Nation as well as a man of his time. And it is my hope, in a changing world, when untold possibilities lie before North Carolina, and indeed the entire South and country, that this university will still hew to the old line of the responsibility that its graduates owe to the community at large--that in your time, too, you will be willing to give to the State and country a portion of your lives and all of your knowledge and all of your loyalty.;I want to emphasize, in the great concentration which we now place upon scientists and engineers, how much we still need the men and women educated in the liberal traditions, willing to take the long look, undisturbed by prejudices and slogans of the moment, who attempt to make an honest judgment on difficult events.;This university has a more important function today than ever before, and therefore I am proud as President of the United States, and as a graduate of a small land grant college in Massachusetts, Harvard University, to come to this center of education.;Those of you who regard my profession of political life with some disdain should remember that it made it possible for me to move from being an obscure lieutenant in the United States Navy to Commander-in-Chief in 14 years, with very little technical competence.;But more than that, I hope that you will realize that from the beginning of this country, and especially in North Carolina, there has been the closest link between educated men and women and politics and government. And also to remember that our nation's first great leaders were also our first great scholars.;A contemporary described Thomas Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32 who could calculate an eclipse, survey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a horse, dance the minuet, and play the violin." John Quincy Adams, after being summarily dismissed by the Massachusetts Legislature from the United States Senate for supporting Thomas Jefferson, could then become Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University, and then become a great Secretary of State.;And Senator Daniel Webster could stroll down the corridors of the Congress a few steps, after making some of the greatest speeches in the history of this country, and dominate the Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his day.;This versatility, this vitality, this intellectual energy, put to the service of our country, represents our great resource in these difficult days.;I would urge you, therefore, regardless of your specialty, and regardless of your chosen field or occupation, and regardless of whether you bear office or not, that you recognize the contribution which you can make as educated men and women to intellectual and political leadership in these difficult days, when the problems are infinitely more complicated and come with increasing speed, with increasing significance, in our lives than they were a century ago when so many gifted men dominated our political life. The United States Senate had more able men serving in it, from the period of 1830 to 1850, than probably any time in our history, and yet they dealt with three or four problems which they had dealt with for over a generation.;Now they come day by day, from all parts of the world. Even the experts find themselves confused, and therefore in a free society such as this, where the people must make an educated judgment, they depend upon those of you who have had the advantage of the scholar's education.;I ask you to give to the service of our country the critical faculties which society has helped develop in you here. I ask you to decide, as Goethe put it, "whether you will be an anvil or a hammer," whether you will give the United States, in which you were reared and educated, the broadest possible benefits of that education.;It's not enough to lend your talents to deploring present solutions. Most educated men and women on occasions prefer to discuss what is wrong, rather than to suggest alternative courses of action. But, "would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece," as George William Curtis asked a body of educators a century ago, "would you have counted him a friend of ancient Greece who quietly discussed the theory of patriotism on that hot summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hours Leonidas and the three hundred stood at Thermopylae for liberty? Was John Milton to conjugate Greek verbs in his library when the liberty of Englishmen was imperiled?;This is a great institution with a great tradition and with devoted alumni, and with the support of the people of this State. Its establishment and continued functioning, like that of all great universities, has required great sacrifice by the people of North Carolina. I cannot believe that all of this is undertaken merely to give this school's graduates an economic advantage in the lifestruggle.;A university," said Professor Woodrow Wilson, "should be an organ of memory for the State, for the transmission of its best traditions." And Prince Bismarck was even more specific. "One third of the students of German universities," he once said, "'broke down from over-work, another third broke down from dissipation, and the other third ruled Germany." I leave it to each of you to decide in which category you will fall.;I do not suggest that our political and public life should be turned over to college trained experts, nor would I give this university a seat in the Congress, as William and Mary was once represented in the Virginia House of Burgesses, nor would I adopt from the Belgian constitution a provision giving three votes instead of one to college graduates--at least not until more Democrats go to college. But I do hope that you join us.;This university produces trained men and women, and what this country needs are those who look, as the motto of your State says, at things as they are and not at things as they seem to be.;For this meeting is held at an extraordinary time. Angola and Algeria, Brazil and Bizerte, Syria and South Viet-Nam, Korea or Kuwait, the Dominican Republic, Berlin, the United Nations itself--all problems which 20 years ago we could not even dream of.;Our task in this country is to do our best, to serve our Nation's interest as we see 'it, and not to be swayed from our course by the faint-hearted or the unknowing, or the threats of those who would make themselves our foes.;This is not a simple task in a democracy. We cannot open all our books in advance to an adversary who operates in the night, the decisions we make, the weapons we possess, the bargains we will accept--nor can we always see reflected overnight the success or failure of the actions that we may take.;In times past, a simple slogan described our policy: "Fifty-four-forty or fight." "To make the world safe for democracy." "No entangling alliances." But the times, issues, and the weapons, all have changed--and complicate and endanger our lives. It is a dangerous illusion to believe that the policies of the United States, stretching as they do world-wide, under varying and different conditions, can be encompassed in one slogan or one adjective, hard or soft or otherwise-or to believe that we shall soon meet total victory or total defeat.;Peace and freedom do not come cheap, and we are destined, all of us here today, to live out most if not all of our lives in uncertainty and challenge and peril. Our policy must therefore blend whatever degree of firmness and flexibility which is necessary to protect our vital interests, by peaceful means if possible, by resolute action if necessary.;There is, of course, no place in America where reason and firmness are more clearly pointed out than here in North Carolina. All Americans can profit from what happened in this State a century ago. It was this State, firmly fixed in the traditions of the South, which sought a way of reason in a troubled and dangerous world. Yet when the War came, North Carolina provided a fourth of all of the Confederate soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in those years. And it won the right to the slogan, "First at Bethel. Farthest to the front at Gettysburg and Chickamauga. Last at Appomattox.;Its quest for a peaceful resolution of our problems was never identified in the minds of its people, of people today, with anything but a desire for peace and a preparation to meet their responsibilities.;We move for the first time in our history through an age in which two opposing powers have the capacity to destroy each other, and while we do not intend to see the free world give up, we shall make every effort to prevent the world from being blown up.;The American Eagle on our official seal emphasizes both peace and freedom, and as I said in the State of the Union Address, we in this country give equal attention to its claws when it in its left hand holds the arrows and in its right the olive branch.;This is a time of national maturity, understanding, and willingness to face issues as they are, not as we would like them to be. It is a test of our ability to be far-seeing and calm, as well as resolute, to keep an eye on both our dangers and our opportunities, and not to be diverted by momentary gains, or setbacks, or pressures. And it is the long view of the educated citizen to which the graduates of this university can best contribute.;We must distinguish the real from the illusory, the long-range from the temporary, the significant from the petty, but if we can be purposeful, if we can face up to our risks and live up to our word, if we can do our duty undeterred by fanatics or frenzy at home or abroad, then surely peace and freedom can prevail. We shall be neither Red nor dead, but alive and free--and worthy of the traditions and responsibilities of North Carolina and the United States of America.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Transcript of Interview With the President by Aleksei Adzhubei, Editor of Izvestia.</td><td class="c6">November 25, 1961</td><td class="c7">Mr. Adzhubei: Mr. President, I am happy to get this interview from you, and I would like to tell you quite frankly that your election to the high post of President of the United States office was met with great hope by public opinion in our country. In connection with this, I would like to ask you the following question--;THE PRESIDENT. May I just say that I appreciate very much your coming to the United States. I also appreciate the opportunity to talk, through you and through your newspaper, to the people of the Soviet Union. I think that communication, an exchange of views, an honest report of what our countries are like and what they want and what the people wish, is in the interests of both our countries and in the interests of peace. So we are delighted to have this opportunity.;Mr. Adzhubei: I would like to ask you the following question. Mr. President, during the election campaign, on several occasions you expressed good intentions with respect to the necessity of improving Soviet-American relations. On the occasion of your Inauguration as President of a great country, Nikita Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and Leonid Brezhnev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in their message to you expressed the hope that by their joint efforts our countries can succeed in radically improving our relations and the international situation. They also expressed confidence that we can, step by step, liquidate the existing suspicion and distrust, and thus bring cooperation between our peoples. On its part, the Soviet government is always ready to support any good endeavor in that direction, and to do its best for the establishment of a stable peace in the world, in order that all peoples may live in friendship and without hatred among them.;Mr. President, what do you think about the present state of Soviet-American relations, and what in your opinion must be done by the American as well as the Soviet governments to improve the relations between our two countries?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I would say that the relations today are not as satisfactory as I had hoped they would be when I first took office. In fact, one of the first things that I did on becoming President was to commit the United States to an earnest effort to achieve a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union on the cessation of nuclear tests. As a result of that effort, at the end of March, we sent our representatives, along with Great Britain's, to Geneva for the first time with a complete treaty which we tabled for discussion. I had hoped that this would be one area where we could make real progress. It would lessen the contamination of the air, it would be a first step towards disarmament, and I felt that if we could achieve an agreement in this area, we could then move on to the other areas of disarmament which required action.;We were not successful. And, as you know, we were in fact still at the table in Geneva in August when, still negotiating, the Soviet Union resumed its tests which must have been in preparation for many months, at the very time that the conversations were going on. So that has been a disappointment.;In addition, Berlin and Germany have become, I think, areas of heightened crisis since the Vienna meeting, and I think extremely dangerous to the peace, which I am sure--I know--both of our people want.;I think that the Soviet Union and the United States should live together in peace. We are large countries, energetic people, we are steadily providing in both our countries an increase in the standard of living. If we can keep the peace for 20 years, the life of the people of the Soviet Union and the life of the people of the United States will be far richer and will be far happier as the standard of living steadily rises.;Where we feel the difficulty comes is the effort by the Soviet Union to communize, in a sense, the entire world. If the Soviet Union were merely seeking to protect its own national interests, to protect its own national security, and would permit other countries to live as they wish--to live in peace--then I believe that the problems which now cause so much tension would fade away.;We want the people of the Soviet Union to live in peace--we want the same for our own people. It is this effort to push outward the communist system, on to country after country, that represents, I think, the great threat to peace. If the Soviet Union looked only to its national interest and to providing a better life for its people under conditions of peace, I think there would be nothing that would disturb the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.;Mr. Adzhubei: That is very interesting. However as a citizen of the Soviet Union, as a member of the Communist Party, I cannot agree with you, in that part of your answer where you are saying that we are trying to "communize" the world. At the 22nd Party Congress, which, in our opinion, was an historic event, we adopted a program of communist development and we said that we are against any export of the revolution, but we are also against any export of counterrevolution. If we turn to facts, there are many countries in the world in the affairs of which, from our point of view the United States is interfering. Yesterday, I saw a TV program which was being shown to millions of Americans, where your commentator asserted that the whole world is under complete threat of the communists to capture the world. We would like to see an end put to this situation.;Our government and our party believe that every people chooses such a system of government as they like. Austria chose the capitalist way of development, although American and Soviet troops were there. But Cuba has chosen another way of development. And we would be happy if you, Mr. President, were to state that the interference in the affairs of Cuba was a mistake. We hope that the Cuban people will consolidate their own way of life--as well as the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Brazil, and many other countries.;THE PRESIDENT. May I just say, without getting into a debate, that the United States supports the idea that every people shall have the right to make a free choice as to the kind of government they want. In the case of Cuba, let me remind you that the Castro revolution was originally supported by the great majority of the people. When Castro was leading the revolution, the statement was made that there would be free elections, and freedom for the people, and progress for the people. But Castro has not kept that commitment. Until the present government of Cuba will allow free and honest elections, in our opinion, it cannot claim to represent the majority of the people. That is our dispute with Cuba.;Mr. Jagan, on the other hand, who was recently elected Prime Minister in British Guiana is a Marxist, but the United States doesn't object--because that choice was made by an honest election, which he won.;If the people of any country choose to follow a communist system in a free election, after a fair opportunity for a number of views to be presented, the United States would accept that. What we find to be objectionable, and a threat to the peace, is When a system is imposed by a small militant group by subversion, infiltration, and all the rest.;If the Soviet Union and this country could develop their own resources, and if you permitted the peoples of the world to develop in the way they wish to develop, then, if any nation should choose a communist system, we would recognize and accept that. And if they chose another system, then we would hope that you would recognize and accept that, too. If we could get that on both sides, I believe the Soviet Union and the United States, which have so much to gain from peace, could live in peace.;Mr. Adzhtfbei: I understand you, Mr. President, and I am very happy to hear these words from you, because as you know, the future of the world depends in many respects on the relations between the United States and our country. Let the people decide what way of development they want to choose. However I would like to draw your attention to the following historical parallel. When the Bolsheviks, headed by V. I. Lenin, came to power, all the capitalist world was shouting that they were plotters and that there was no freedom in Russia but in 44 years our country became a great power. But this is not the issue. I would like to ask you another question--;THE PRESIDENT. You are a newspaper man and a politician.;Mr. Adzhubei: In our country every citizen is a politician, because we like our country very much. The young and the old like the socialist system of our country and we are ready to fight for it until its victorious end. You are proud of your country, Mr. President, and we are also very much proud of our own country, and we are very proud of our party, and we are proud of V. I. Lenin.;Mr. President, sometimes it's said that in order to improve the relations between our countries, it is necessary to start with the settlement of small problems. Others believe that too many small issues have accumulated and that perhaps it would be better to start with a big act. We believe that such a big act was the visit by Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev to the United States in 1959. But unfortunately the resuits of that trip were not completely satisfactory. 1 Mr. President, what is your attitude toward the idea of concluding a pact of peace between the United States and the Soviet Union? That would be a great step forward.;THE PRESIDENT. I think we should have not only an agreement between our countries, but take those steps which make peace possible. I don't think that paper, and words on paper, are as significant as looking at those areas which provide tension between our two systems and seeing if we can dispel that tension.;1 This sentence, as published in Izvestta, reads: "Bat the positive results of that trip were wrecked and brought to nothing by the well. known actions of the then American administration.;One of those areas now is the problem of Germany and Berlin. If we could make progress there, then in my opinion it would provide a most important step in improving our relations in other areas.;I stated that if we had been able to get an agreement on the nuclear tests cessation, that would lead to other agreements on disarmament. If we can make an agreement successfully which provides peace in Central Europe, if we can conclude our efforts in Laos and insure a government and a country which are neutral and independent, as Chairman Khrushchev and I agreed at Vienna, then we would be able to move into other areas of tension. I believe, as I have said, if we can now make an agreement on a satisfactory basis on Berlin and Germany, which is the most critical area--because it represents a matter of great interest to both our countries, and great concern to our peoples-then we could take other steps. If we can solve the problem of Germany and Berlin, I believe we can find our relations substantially improved.;Mr. Adzhubei: Thank you, Mr. President, this is a most worthy thought. Especially because, as I understand you, you intend to talk seriously on these problems with our government. Let me say that the German problem is of great importance to our country, for many reasons. Not only for strictly political reasons, and not only because of prestige considerations. As you know we have allies--Poland, Czechoslovakia, and a number of other countries. However, to date we haven't heard any sober voices from the West affirming the integrity of the borders existing in Europe and it would be very important to hear that. But there is also another aspect to the German problem. In our country, in the Soviet Union, there is not a single family that did not lose some kin in the war. You know we are trying to put out the smoldering coals of the last war in Central Europe. But we do not wish only to play the role of a political fireman, as it were, though it is very important. In the heart of every Soviet citizen, in the soul of every Soviet citizen, there are, as you know, coals still burning from the last war and they are burning his soul and does not let him sleep quietly. Thus, solution of the question of a peace treaty is the hope and tranquillity in the heart of every Soviet man. After all we are still singing songs about those who did not come home from the war. I know that you participated in the war, that you are a hero of the war, and this is why I am talking to you in such lofty words. But this, if you wish, is a sideline.;Mr. President, in 1958, if I am not mistaken, our government suggested to the government of the United States--of course, the previous administration was in power then-that the trade relations between our countries be normalized. Now, as you know, the trade relations between our countries are in a very lamentable condition. Before I left for the United States, I had a conversation with my friends from the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and they asked me to inquire with you whether there are any prospects of improving the trade relations between our countries. After all there is a very old truth: together with goods, together with the exchange of goods, there also come better relations among peoples.;THE PRESIDENT. Let me say that I know that the Soviet Union suffered more from World War II than any country. It represented a terrible blow, and the casualties affected every family, including many of the families of those now in government.;I will say that the United States also suffered, though not so heavily as the Soviet Union, quite obviously. My brother was killed in Europe. My sister's husband was killed in Europe.;The point is that that war is now over. We want to prevent another war arising out of Germany. I think the important thing between the United States and the USSR is not to create the kind of tension and pressure, which in the name of settling World War II increases the chances of a conflict between the Soviet Union and its allies on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other. What we should attempt to do is work out a solution through negotiation which will make it possible to keep the peace in Central Europe. And that is the aim of this government.;Now in regard to trade, one of the first things I did on becoming President was to change governmental policy which provided for the admission of crab meat. This was not a matter of great dollar value, but had some symbolic importance, and was a matter which Chairman Khrushchev had spoken about on several occasions.;My own judgment is that, if we can solve the problems that we are now talking about, particularly in Berlin, and ease the general tension, trade will then increase. What has diminished trade in recent months has been the difficulty which we have experienced in Germany and Berlin. I would hope that trade could be expanded, and in my judgment it would expand immediately, if we can bring about a peaceful and satisfactory solution to the interests of all in Germany and Berlin.;Mr. Adzhubei: I shall communicate your words to our readers with a feeling of satisfaction. We have always thought and still think of the Americans as the realists. It is your energy, your realistic approach, that has helped you to create such a wealthy country. But now I would like to ask you frankly, Mr. President, because this idea was expressed by you in several instances, whether you seriously think that the social changes which are happening in the world today are the result of actions in which Moscow has its hands? I would like to remind you of one thing. You know, in France when the bourgeois revolution won, the aristocratic Europe accused France of every mortal sin. When the October revolution won, all the world of the rich condemned that revolution. But this revolution won! You mentioned that a Marxist came to power in British Guiana. Do you think that events occurred there according to our instructions? Of course, we can't give you any assurances that there won't be social changes in the world, although you will call it the result of the "hands" of Moscow.;THE PRESIDENT. Let me say, as I indicated, if the people of these countries make a free choice, that they prefer the communist or socialist or any other kind of system, then the United States and the people of the United States accept that. That is why I gave the example of British Guiana. But of course I do not hold and I do not say that the Soviet Union is responsible for all the changes that are coming in the world. For example, since the end of World War II, the British Empire has been turned into independent states, I think 15 of them. The French community has been turned into 21 independent states. There are many changes in the world. Western Europe has joined closer together in the Common Market. These are not the result of the communists' efforts. There are many changes, as I have said, throughout the world. People want to live in different ways. That is what we want, also. If they have a fair opportunity to make a choice, if they choose to support communism, we accept that. What we object to is the attempt to impose communism by force, or a situation where once a people may have fallen under communism the communists do not give them a fair opportunity to make another choice.;We had been under the impression that the Yalta Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement provided for a free choice for the peoples of Eastern Europe. They do not, in our opinion, today have a free choice. You may argue that they may want to live under communism, but if they do not they are not given the opportunity to change.;We believe that if the Soviet Union--without attempting to impose the communist system--will permit the people of the world to live as they wish to live, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States will then be very satisfactory, and our two peoples, which now live in danger, will be able to live in peace and with a greatly increased standard of living. And I believe we have such vast economic opportunities now in both of our countries that we should consider how we can get along, and not attempt to impose our views, one on the other or on anyone else.;Mr. Adzhubei: Of course, Mr. President, I did not expect in such a short period of time I would succeed in converting you to another belief--just as you did not expect to convert me. You have talked with our Chairman, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and he did not succeed in convincing you, nor did he try to do so. This, as you know, is a matter of personal outlook. One man may consider certain elections to be free, while another would consider those elections 'non-democratic. For example, in a number of countries of Latin America, great revolutionary changes are taking place. For a long period of time you considered that Trujillo was elected in a democratic way. You have been saying the same about the regime of the Shah of Iran as well. But let us not engage in an argument and let us turn to the next question.;Mr. President, may I ask you the following question? It is well known that the Soviet government has declared its readiness to accept any proposal of the Western powers on international control and inspection, if agreement on general and complete disarmament is reached. At the same time, the Soviet government does not exclude the possibility of reaching agreement on a number of measures which may decrease the danger of war and which could be effected in the nearest future. Such proposals are, for instance, the proposals on the freezing of military budgets, renunciation of the use of nuclear weapons, the conclusion of a nonaggression pact between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries, withdrawal of foreign troops from the territories of other countries, the establishment of a nuclear free zone, or measures against the danger of surprise attack. What, in your views, are the prospects of general and complete disarmament, and of decreasing international tensions?;THE PRESIDENT. Inasmuch as the Soviet Union and the United States agreed in the declaration of principles in September, at the end of the McCloy-Zorin talks, on the goal of general and complete disarmament, the problem now becomes an attempt to implement that goal, stage by stage. The Soviet Union and the United States have a basic disagreement which must be resolved on this question. We believe that there must be adequate inspection, to make sure that each side is disarming and staying in accordance with the agreements which they make. The Soviet Union has stated that it will permit us, or the international body, to inspect those weapons which are destroyed but will not permit us to carry out an inspection to see what weapons remain. One side could destroy a hundred bombers but still have a thousand or two thousand bombers left. If you are really going to provide for orderly disarmament, it seems to me you have to inspect not only those weapons which have been destroyed, but also those weapons that remain. Otherwise we do not have any guarantee of security for either side. If we can agree to an effective inspection system so that each country can know that the other is living up to its agreement, then, in my opinion, we can move into general and complete disarmament.;That is why I thought it so vitally important that we make an agreement on cessation of nuclear testing as the first step, and then proceed step by step through atomic weapons, through missiles, through the level of ground forces, the Navy, and all the rest. If we can get agreement on that, then we can move toward general and complete disarmament.;I think it would be helpful if NATO and the Warsaw pact engaged in a commitment to live in peace with each other. I certainly believe we should take every conceivable step to prevent surprise attack. I believe that if the relations between our countries can be normalized, there will be less military buildup on both sides, but we cannot now withdraw our troops from Europe, way back across the Atlantic Ocean, when you merely withdraw your troops to the Soviet Union which is only a few hundred miles away. That is why we need some understanding of what is going to be the situation in Berlin and in Germany. And that is why I hope negotiations will take place between our governments quickly and will come to a successful conclusion.;The statement has been made on many occasions that we object to the signing of a peace treaty, that we regard that as a belligerent act. That is not the point. It is our view that the statement which the four powers made at Geneva in 1955 providing for the reunification of Germany represents the soundest policy. To divide a country, to divide a city, to put up a wall in a city, we believe, only increases tensions rather than diminish them. And we believe that, if the German people were permitted to be reunifled, adequate steps could be taken to protect the security of all involved.;Now we recognize that today the Soviet Union does not intend to permit reunification, and that as long as the Soviet Union has that policy, Germany will not be reunifled. The question now is whether the Soviet Union will sign a treaty with the East German authorities which will increase tension rather than diminish it. As I said in my speech at the United Nations, we recognize that the Soviet Union can sign any treaty it wishes with the East German authorities. What we find to be so dangerous, however, is the claim that that treaty will deny us our rights in West Berlin, rights which we won through the war, rights which were agreed to by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France at the conclusion of the war, and which we believe should be continued. But if you sign a, treaty with East Germany and those rights are subject to the wishes of the East German authorities, it seems to me that that is going to increase tension. If the Soviet Union attempts in that treaty to turn over jurisdiction over West Berlin to the East German authorities, against the wishes of the people of West Berlin--if the lines of communication and access, from West Berlin to the outside world and the West, are completely under the control of East German authorities to cut any time they so wish--then this treaty does not bring peace, it only increases the danger.;Now I am hopeful that, in the conversations and negotiations which we hope to have with the Soviet Union, assurances will be given which will permit us to continue to exercise the rights which we now have in West Berlin, as a result of the existing four power agreement, and will permit free access in and out of the city. We do not want to stay in West Berlin if the people there do not want us to stay. But they want us to stay. When they decide that they don't want us, we will leave. But as long as they wish us to stay, it seems to me that the rights which are ours by agreement should be maintained. I am hopeful that the Soviet Union will agree with this, and in particular will agree to permit supplies and people to move in and out of West Berlin freely. Then we can, in my opinion, reach a peaceful settlement in the center of Europe, and if we can reach an agreement on this question, then I believe our relations will greatly improve.;Mr. Adzhubei: You just answered the question I was going to ask. But I cannot agree with you. I am not a specialist in the field of disarmament, but as I understand it, the McCloy-Zorin agreement was a very important step forward, and we hope that the efforts by specialists who will be authorized by our governments will lead to better resuits. And now a few words about Germany. If I understood correctly the translation, I have heard a very unrealistic term. I have in mind the term "East German authorities." It would be more pleasant to hear "government of the German Democratic Republic." You don't like the German Democratic Republic. We don't like the Federal Republic of Germany, but we have diplomatic relations with the FRG, we have very good trade relations with it. Thus, we are realists. If the government of the United States were not saying "East German authorities" but were to say "government of the GDR," that would be very good and realistic.;And now a second point. We would like to sign a peace treaty together with our World War II allies, and we hope that it will be so. It would be a great happiness not only for our government but also for our people. Nobody intends to turn West Berlin over to East Germany. That does not make sense. There is the GDR and there is the FRG with its capitalist system. Let's sign a peace treaty and let us guarantee freedom for West Berlin by every means-by troops of the four powers, by United Nations troops--and let's thus guarantee its rights. But this is a problem for future negotiation. Now a few words about access to West Berlin. Why complicate such a simple problem? Communication to West Berlin runs over 100 miles through the territory of the German Democratic Republic. If one needs to visit West Berlin, if it is necessary to send people, food or other goods there, then it is very elementary to ask permission for that of the government of the GDR. Sometimes I feel--and I am saying this to you very frankly--that some evil people are attempting to complicate simple things and thus are deliberately creating tension. Yesterday, when I was talking with your closest advisers, I gave this example: if a man has his nervous system extremely strained, he is irritated by every noise, every sound and everything is taken by him very suspiciously. Such a man can create much trouble. We hope that the negotiations which will take place in the near future will be objective, realistic, and will be conducted in an atmosphere of complete calm.;THE PRESIDENT. May I just make one brief response? All Berlin was put under fourpower authority by the agreements at Potsdam. East Berlin, which was under the immediate authority of the Soviet Union, has now been turned over to East Germany in violation of those agreements. It is no longer effectively under four-power control. And now the Soviet Union seeks to place Soviet troops in West Berlin. It does not suggest that the troops of the other three powers be placed in East Berlin. In other words, the Soviet Union now seeks to share in the control of West Berlin. That is the first point that is in question. The second is this question of the rights of access in crossing East Germany. As I gather it, you would give the East German authorities-you say East German government--the power to interfere with that traffic. It is stated that they would not do so, but we have no assurances in Mr. Ulbricht's statements which vary from week to week. In my opinion, if such an agreement is signed, if our rights on the communication lines between the West and West Berlin--which are now governed by the Soviet Union--are turned over to the East German authorities, and if the East Germans should interfere with that right of access, for one reason or another, then this would provide for heightened tension, the Soviet Union might come to the support of East Germany and we would find ourselves, instead of having settled this now, once more face to face.;The reason why we have been reluctant to recognize East Germany as a sovereign power is that we do not recognize the division of Germany. In our opinion the German people wish to have one united country. If the Soviet Union had lost the war, the Soviet people themselves would object to a line being drawn through Moscow and the entire country. If we had been defeated in war, we wouldn't like to have a line drawn down the Mississippi River. The Germans want to be united. I think it should be possible to provide for that under conditions which will protect the interests of all concerned. But the Soviet Union believes that it is more in their interest to keep Germany divided.;Now the question is--given that decision-can we provide for the protection of our rights in West Berlin, which were agreed to in 1945 by the Soviet Union, so that this is not a continuing crisis? In attempting to work out a solution of the problems which came about as a result of World War II, we don't want to increase the chances of World War III. All we wish to do is maintain a very limited--and they are a very limited number of troops of the three powers in West Berlin and to have, for example, an international administration on the Autobahn so that goods and people can move freely in and out. Then we can have peace in this area for years. But if East Germany is going to exercise the right of authority over that access, we are going to have continued tension there--and I simply do not see, given the strong interests of both of us in having peace in this part of Europe, why that is a wise decision. I am hopeful instead that the negotiations which we are anxious to see take place will bring about an agreement on this area which will recognize fairly the interests of all.;Mr. Adzhubei: Mr. President, since I'm talking to you in a very frank and friendly manner, I would like to ask you to imagine, at least for a moment, the following impossible thing. Imagine that you were an ricer, a veteran of the Soviet Navy, who fought in World War II. You won the war, and then the very events occurred which are now taking place. One of the parts of Germany-the Federal Republic of Germany-does not recognize the borders which have been established after the war. It is again building up its armed forces. The Chancellor of that country goes to the United States to talk to the President of the United States and they have secret talks. The spirit of revanchism is very high in that part of Germany. What would your attitude be toward this, if you were a veteran of the Soviet Navy?;THE PRESIDENT. If I were a Soviet veteran, I would see that West Germany now has only 9 divisions, which is a fraction of the Soviet forces. Nine divisions. It has no nuclear weapons of its own. It has a very small Air Force--almost no Navy, I think perhaps two or three submarines. So it is not a military threat. Its nine divisions are under the international control of NATO, and subject to the command of the NATO organization, which is made up of 15 countries of Europe which altogether have, in West Germany now, about 22 or 23 divisions-about the same number as the Soviet divisions in East Germany. So that I do not see that this country represents a military threat now to the Soviet Union, even though I recognize how bitter was the struggle in World War II--in the same way that Japan today represents no threat to the United States, even though 20 years ago there were 4 years of war in the Pacific against the Japanese. The power of countries changes--weapons change--science changes--without missiles, without nuclear capability, with very few divisions today, I don't believe West Germany is a military threat.;Then I would look at the power of the United States, and I would look at the power of the Soviet Union, and I would say that the important thing is for the Soviet Union and the United States not to get into a war, which would destroy both of our systems. So as a Soviet veteran, I would want the Soviet Union to reach an agreement with the United States which recognizes the interests and the commitments of the United States, as well as our own, and not attempt to enforce single-handedly a new situation upon the United States which would be against previous commitments we had made. The Soviet Union made a commitment in regard to Berlin in 1945. Germany today is divided. Germany today is not a threat to the Soviet Union militarily.;The important thing is to attempt to reach an accord which recognizes the interests of all, and I believe that can be done with respect to Germany. I recognize that there are going to be two Germanies as long as the Soviet Union believes that that is in her interest. The problem now is to make sure that, in any treaty which the Soviet Union reaches with East Germany, the rights of the other powers are recognized in Berlin. That's all we're talking about. We are not talking about encouraging revanchism, building a great German military machine, or anything else you mention. In any peace treaty which is signed with East Germany, there must be a recognition of the rights of the United States and the other powers.;Now that does not seem to me to be a threat in any way to the security of the Soviet Union. That does not provide for any increase in the Western military forces, which are rather limited there. I think we could have peace in this century in Central Europe if we can reach an accord over West Berlin. To pursue another course in the name of ending World War II--a course which threatens to increase the chance of World War III--represents a wholly unwise policy, for you and for us.;So, if I were a Soviet officer and wanted peace, I would think peace can be won and my country's security can be assured. The Soviet Union is a strong military power. It has great nuclear capacity. It has missiles, planes--it has a great number of divisions-it has countries associated with it. No one is ever going to invade the Soviet Union again. There is no military power that can do that. The problem is to make an agreement which will permit us to have our interests recognized, as well as yours. That should not be beyond the capacity of us both.;Chairman Khrushchev did not, nor did I, make the arrangements in 1945 in regard to Berlin. Our responsibility, given the situation which is a difficult one, is to bring about peace, and I believe it can be done.;In short, if I were a Soviet naval officer, I would feel that the security of the Soviet Union was well protected, and that the important thing now is to.reach an accord with the United States, our ally during that second war;Mr. Adzhubei: Mr. President, I am about to finish. Of course, you answered this question not as a veteran of the Soviet armed forces but as President of the United States, and that is quite natural. However, as I understand you, Mr. President, you are against West Germany's having nuclear weapons at her disposal, or in any degree of control over such weapons?;THE PRESIDENT. The United States, as a matter of national policy, as I said at the United Nations, will not give nuclear weapons to any country, and I would be extremely reluctant to see West Germany acquire a nuclear capacity of its own. Chancellor Adenauer stated that they would not, in 1954. That is still the policy of that government, and I think that is the wise policy.;Mr. Adzhubei: But you know perfectly well that many top posts in NATO are occupied by German generals, and you know that Europe is very far from the United States. Don't you think that at some point it might happen that German generals might become too influential in NATO?;THE PRESIDENT. That is why I believe it to be so important to stress the West German army is integrated in NATO. NATO is now commanded by an American, and, in my judgment, as long as German forces are integrated in NATO--and NATO is under the control of the 15 NATO countries, none of which wants another war--there is security for all. And I think that will continue.;Now if this situation changed, if Germany developed an atomic capability of its own, if it developed many missiles, or a strong national army that threatened war, then I would understand your concern, and I would share it. After all, we have had two wars in Europe, as well as you. But the situation today, and the situation for the future, is as I have described it. If it changed, then it would seem to me appropriate for the United States and the Soviet Union and others to consider the situation at that time. But it is not that way now, so why take the risk of having the United States, which is a powerful country, and the Soviet Union, which is also powerful, getting into difficulty with each other, when there is no real threat in Europe to you or to us. I think that we should look at things as they are in 1961.;You have stated that you are realists. This is not 1939, 1940, or 1941. Look what has happened. As I said, in the Far East, Japan's strength was entirely different in those years. China's power was also entirely different. Countries change. Situations change. And we have to be realistic enough to see where the real danger lies. The real danger today is the fact that both of us possess in our nuclear stockpiles the means to impose great devastation upon each other--and we are the ones that have the most to lose from war.;Therefore I think, if we look at it realistically, we should be able to reach an accord which protects the interests of our two great countries, and permits us both to go ahead with increasing our standard of living and meeting other problems. In the United States in the last 14 years our living standard has increased 40 percent. In the Soviet Union it has gone up sharply. Nobody can benefit more from peace than the Soviet Union and the United States.;I would hope that rather than attempting to talk about conditions in Germany as they were 20 years ago, we would look at them as they are today. We have had peace, really, in Europe for 15 years. The problem now is to see if we can reach a negotiation which can settle this matter for another 15 years. Nobody knows what is going to happen in the world over the long run, but at least we ought to be able to settle this matter of Berlin and Germany.;Mr. Adzhubei: I thank you for your attention and this time that I took from your weekend rest.;THE PRESIDENT. I appreciate very much your giving me, as President, this opportunity to talk to the people of the Soviet Union, and your courtesy in coming here. I want to emphasize that to the people of this country there is nothing that would satisfy them more than to see the two countries live at peace, and the people of the two countries enjoying a steadily increasing standard of living. I was in the Soviet Union as a student in 1939, and I understand that there have been many changes, and that the standard of living of the people is rising. The standards of the people of the United States have also risen. I am hopeful that this interview will contribute in some degree to better understanding and to peace. For, I repeat again, our two peoples have the most to gain from peace.;Mr. Adzhubei: Thank you Mr. President.</td></tr>

Kennedy: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">November 29, 1961</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Are there any questions?;[1.] Q. Mr. President, last week we had a show of force off the Dominican Republic. Under what circumstances would these ships and men actually have gone into action and is this an indication of policy in the hemisphere? Would U.S. forces be used to knock out any attempt by Castro, for instance, to overthrow an existing government?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, the United States forces which remained in international waters were there because there was some feeling that steps might be taken in the Dominican Republic which would end any hope that a democratic solution could be achieved. Because events in the Dominican Republic proceeded in the way they did, United States forces have been gradually withdrawn.;It's our hope that, as a result of the conversations now going on in the Dominican Republic, that we can make progress towards achieving the kind of government which will permit the Dominican people to control their own destiny.;As to the broader questions, we would, of course, be concerned and have responsibilities as a member of the Organization of American States, if actions were taken by one state against another state through the use of force, and we would be most concerned about that whatever its source and particularly if its source came from the one you describe.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, do you plan a trip out of the country any time before the first of the year?;THE PRESIDENT. We have not finalized any plans.;[3.] Q. The Government-controlled press in South Viet-Nam is attacking the United States now, apparently because we are asking for political reforms in exchange for our military and economic assistance. I wonder if this has jeopardized our effort to stop communism there, and if you could throw any light on this situation for us?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there have been stories in the press there that have been critical of the United States and of course there have been stories in the United States press which may in some cases bear a different relationship to the Government than the press in Saigon does to its government but which nevertheless have suggested that the steps which are being taken within Viet-Nam to counter the Communist threat have not been sufficient. We--of course, our ambition is to permit the Vietnamese people to control their destiny, and we are attempting to work with the Government and encourage steps which will increase the sense of commitment by the people of Viet-Nam' to the struggle. These steps are bound to be subject to discussion and controversy, and we are going to continue to have our conversations with the Vietnamese Government.;[4.] Q. Mr. President, what significance do you see in the fact that the Soviet Government at this time permitted you to speak to the Russian people?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I welcomed it. We had expressed, Mr. Salinger had--I think other newspapermen in the United States had expressed their concern that Mr. Khrushchev had been interviewed at some length by three or four American newspapermen, that all his views were carried in full in the Western world and particularly in the United States, but no similar opportunity had been given to the President of the United States or any other American leaders and this view was presented with vigor to Soviet representatives and I am delighted that they decided to give us that opportunity.;Q. Mr. President, when Mr. Khrushchev visited this country a couple of years ago, he had quite a number of chances to speak to the American people on virtually all of our radio, television, and newspapers. Would you welcome such an opportunity to do so personally in the Soviet Union to speak to the Russian people and see them?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I would think that Mr. Khrushchev came on invitation of the President of the United States and was a guest of the United States. I have not been given a similar invitation. I think that the important thing now is to attempt to work out a solution to the difficult problems which disturb our relations. The interview mentioned Germany and Berlin. There are also problems in southeast Asia, and that's the immediate task. And I think that probably they hold that view too in regard to any visit by a President of the United States that there are important problems that must be solved before such a visit would be rewarding to either side. No such invitation has as yet been extended.;Q. Mr. President, in your interview with the Izvestia reporter you said that what we objected to was the deprivation of a political choice, and I wonder if you could discuss with us how this criterion would apply to Finland where apparently the only anti-Soviet candidate and opponent to President Kekkonen has been pressured into retiring from the race.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the general thesis which I expressed on Saturday stands. We--what we desire is that the people of these countries will have a free choice. If they choose to follow under a condition of freedom, as I've said, with sufficient opportunity for alternative views to be presented, then we accept that. We would feel also, of course, that if they should choose the Communist system, then they should also be given the opportunity at another date to make another choice.;That is what we regard as freedom. That is not the view that has been held by the Soviet Union. And I would prefer to make that as a general statement rather than apply it to any particular country because some countries are having difficulties and I'm not sure that any statement that we might make at this time would be of assistance to them.;[5.] Q. Mr. President, you and your wife and other members of your family have declined to go to private clubs and to take part in other functions, even women's benefits at churches, where there was racial segregation. Now I wonder if you don't think it's simply fair that the President of the United States, members of his Cabinet, U.S. Ambassadors and other officers of this Government should decline to speak at and participate in functions where women newspaper reporters are barred?;THE PRESIDENT. I feel that I have many responsibilities and the press has less and I would think that the press should deal with that problem and I'm sure that--I think it would be most appropriate if the members of the Press Club had a meeting and permitted you to come and present your views to them. [Laughter];I will say that as we are expected, as President, to comment on everything, I will say that in my judgment when an official visitor comes to speak to the Press Club, that all working reporters should be permitted in on a basis of equality. That is not a social occasion but a working occasion.;That happens to be my personal view and the members of the Press Club will have to decide it in the way they want. They are entitled to have any arrangement they would want in regards, I would think, to social occasions, but I would think that when there is an official visitor here as part of--the guest of the people of the United States and there's a meeting held, that all reporters should come on a basis of equality. But that--I am not a member of the Press Club except honorary and therefore--but I give my view as an honorary member, not as President of the United States. [Laughter];[6.] Q. Mr. President, in your interview yesterday--published yesterday--you spoke of the possibility of a commitment to peace between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Senator Mansfield early this month also suggested an exploratory meeting between the members of these two pacts to attempt to work out a better understanding between them.;Are these two ideas, yours and Senator Mansfield's, in the same vein and do you envisage such a meeting?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as I stated, as we stated at the time of the visit of Chancellor Adenauer, we hoped that negotiations would take place in regard to Berlin and Germany, and of course, this is a question which would be related to that. And at that time we would attempt to improve the relations between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries.;I think there are some differences in the view expressed by Senator Mansfield and by me, but the purpose was the same--to provide a lessening of tensions between the two blocs and to improve their relations. I think that the details could best be worked out in negotiation, but we cannot have, of course, an increase in harmony between the two blocs until we've come to some. negotiated and mutually satisfactory agreement in regard to Berlin and Germany. After we've done that, then such an arrangement would be meaningful.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, could you tell us what you had in mind when you suggested in your interview with Mr. Adzhubei the creation of an international administration on the Autobahn to Berlin?;THE PRESIDENT. I would think that--what I'm anxious to do is to work out some system which will permit freedom of access for the people of West Berlin without constant pressures and without harassment's which endanger their freedom and which increase the tensions between the countries.;One of the suggestions which have been considered is to provide some international authority which will control traffic in the Autobahn and, therefore, guarantee its free movement. I think we would have to wait until negotiations began between the Soviet Union and the Western powers before any precise suggestions in regard to this kind of control might be put forward.;Q. May I ask a subordinate question, sir? Does this contemplate international control under the United Nations, or something apart from the U.N.?;THE PRESIDENT. The details, I would think, of what kind of an international authority might be arranged could be, I think, better a subject for the negotiations. There could be many different forms that it would take--four--power, U.N., or some other bodies--but it must be one, of course, which is acceptable to both sides. That would be difficult to achieve, but I believe, would be one of the chief points in any negotiations.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, Congressman John Fogarty has criticized as a devastating blow to major areas of medical research, the recent cut of $60 million by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from the budget of the National Institutes of Health.;Also, in the name of economy, the Atomic Energy Commission has announced curtailment of its reactor program.;Would you comment on this, and is any consideration being given to restoring these cuts?;THE PRESIDENT. The difficulty--whenever we have a cut, well everyone wants economy and wants cuts. Whenever any cut is made, of course, there are always complaints about it. Now the fact of the matter is that we substantially increased over the Eisenhower budget the amount that we requested for the Department of HEW, including research--including support for the health institutes.;The House of Representatives increased our request and the Senate substantially increased it. Now the figure which Mr. Ribicoff cut to was, I believe, several million dollars above the figure that the House of Representatives themselves passed, and the fact of the matter is that the figure as it now stands in the area of HEW, cancer research and others, is 25 percent now above what it was a year ago.;So that I think that we have funded these programs adequately. We would spend additional funds if we felt they could be usefully spent. And this matter has been very carefully examined.;And let me reiterate: the amount of money being spent is 25 percent above what was spent last year and it is above what was recommended by the House of Representatives itself, as well as being now above what we recommended in our budget, which was substantially above what President Eisenhower recommended in his budget.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, could you discuss the recent personnel changes in your administration and the reasons behind them?;THE PRESIDENT. The question was: would I discuss the recent personnel changes in our administration, and the reasons behind it. I think the first sentence of our announcement on Sunday, which said that we thought the changes would provide a better matching of the men with their tasks and responsibilities explains the change.;One of the problems, of course, is that our attention is focused today on--particularly on Western Europe, Berlin, Germany, the Common Market, and the Soviet and bloc tensions with the NATO Alliance and the United States.;We are, of course, also bearing heavy responsibilities and are extremely concerned with the course of events in South America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.;Mr. Bowles has traveled a good deal in those areas before and after becoming Under Secretary. He is now going to devote his entire time to our problems and policies in those areas. I believe it's a much more effective use of his extremely--of his obvious talents to use him in this area, rather than using him in the area of day-to-day administration in the Department of State.;I regard this, as I've said, as an increased opportunity for Mr. Bowles, and I think it's vitally important to the United States. We do not want to become so concerned about the problems we face in Western Europe that we ignore the tremendous responsibilities and opportunities that are before the free world in these important sections of the world.;So that I'm encouraged by the changes and I'm grateful to Mr. Bowles for taking on this assignment. I think he can render a real service as he has in the past.;I'm also grateful to Governor Harriman for becoming, after holding probably as many important jobs as any American in our history, with the possible exception of John Quincy Adams, for now taking on the job of Assistant Secretary for the Far East.;[10.] Q. Mr. President, there are reports that the morale among the Reservists who have been called up is bad. They claim they don't have--they say they have nothing to do, the equipment is inadequate. Do you care to comment?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have seen the newspaper stories. There isn't any doubt that any newspaper can go out and interview men who've been called up. Their lives are disturbed. Many of them are older. They've all got jobs. For most of them it's a heavy sacrifice. And we are not at war.;And they go to camps which have perhaps been newly opened or where the equipment may not be immediately available. And they're bound to be unhappy. I've seen the stories in some cases where newspapers have reported that the Department of Defense is determined to keep these people in for more than a year.;Then when it was proved that that story was wholly wrong, they then write that the Pentagon has changed its mind and not going to keep them in more than a year and then sent their reporters around to examine and interview servicemen and build up the sense that Americans are not ready to serve their country.;Now let me make it very clear what the reason, that we called these men--the reason we called these men is that there is a direct clash of interest in a major area, which is Berlin and West Germany. There also is increased tension in Viet-Nam.;When we came into office, we did not feel that there was sufficient strength in our conventional forces. Of the 14 Army divisions, 3 were training divisions. And the United States has commitments all around the world.;Now, while we rely on our nuclear weapons, we also, as I've said, want to have a choice between humiliation and a holocaust. And therefore, we believe that calling these men up and their willingness to serve increased the chance of maintaining the peace.;There are countries where leaders have talked very strongly about standing firm in various areas, but do not have the military force to support that statement. We require it. The United States is the strongest power and the leader of the free world, and as such we must have the power to make our commitments good.;These men, who may be serving in a very cold and windy camp in Fort Lewis, in Washington, therefore, are rendering the same kind of service to our country that an airplane standing on a 15-minute alert at a SAC base in Omaha is rendering. We called them in, in order to prevent a war, not to fight a war.;And, if our efforts to hold the peace should fail, then, of course, they would be used in a more direct way. But their function today is to indicate that the United States is serious about its commitments, that it means to meet its commitments, that it wants to negotiate a peaceful settlement if it can, but it does not propose to surrender.;And therefore, I would hope that any serviceman who is sitting in a camp, however unsatisfactory it may be, and I know how unsatisfactory it is, will recognize that he is contributing to the security of his family in a most direct way.;And, in these days when weapons are so terrible, the important thing is to attempt to maintain the peace, and they're helping to do it.;And I think it's up to us to make sure that they do get the equipment. It is up to us to make sure that their training is useful. As I have said, we've sent the Inspector General out to Washington to look at the camp and to talk to the people involved.;But I do think it would be well for us all to recognize that in the first place, these men are not going to be kept in longer than a year. There has never been such a proposal in the Pentagon that I've ever heard of--newspaper reports to the contrary, notwithstanding. This has never been suggested.;Secondly, it is our hope to get these men out before their 12-month period.;Third, these men were called in at the request of the administration and with the approval of the Congress, which gave us the authorization to call them in. In my opinion they're rendering a valuable function. We are going to get them out as quickly 'as we can. But they are doing a service and I hope they recognize it and I hope that all of us who are in a position to communicate will explain to them and to their families how important their service is today.;Q. Mr. President, now the--;THE PRESIDENT. This chimpanzee who is flying in space took off at 10:08. He reports that everything is perfect and working well. [Laughter];[11.] Q. Mr. President, now that you have met with Chancellor Adenauer and the British Prime Minister Macmillan has met with French President de Gaulle, will you give us your view, sir, of the present state of Western readiness for negotiations on Berlin?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there is one more step to be taken in that series of meetings, and that is the meeting between Chancellor Adenauer and General de Gaulle which is, was supposed to take place this week but has been delayed a week because of the Chancellor's cold, but which will take place before the meeting of the foreign ministers at the time of NATO. And at that time, then, we should be able more precisely to answer that question.;[12.] Q. Could you clarify your rather mystifying remark about a possible trip abroad? Are you thinking of going to the NATO meeting in December?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I'm not.;Q. Could you tell us anything more about it?;THE PRESIDENT. I will as soon as we've made a decision about whether such a trip would be useful, but I'm not thinking about going to NATO. But I don't mean to be at all unresponsive, but the trip has not been--a trip has not been definitely arranged, and until it is, it would seem to me to be-and it depends on circumstances which may develop in the future and therefore it's really in about the status that I suggested.;[13.] Q. Mr. President, in attempts to clarify your civil defense policy, it's been reported that you favor community shelter, fallout shelters, over the private shelters. If this was so, could you give us some of your reasoning behind that move?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have never thought that the Government could engage in the task of building shelters in each home because it would be a diversion of our resources and would vitally affect our deterrent strength which remains our best hope of avoiding a nuclear exchange. So that we have stated from the beginning and the decisions made last spring and summer in regard to the markings of available shelters emphasize the community structure.;We made some decisions in regard to Federal policy in relation to community shelters last Friday. We are now going to talk to some of the Governors who are directly concerned and involved in this matter because it requires cooperation between the Federal Government, the State, and the communities so that we will have a program and a budget to send to the Congress in January.;The emphasis will be on community shelters, and information will be made available to the individual as to what he could do within his own home. But the central responsibility, it seems to me, is for us to provide community shelters. It seems--it seemed the most effective use of our resources and to provide the best security for our people.;[14.] Q. Mr. President, there have been reports of sizable financial contributions to the sort of right-wing extremist groups that you criticized last week. Do you regard this as a danger to the elective process and will you press in the next session for some form of Federal financing of elections?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as you know we set up a committee to provide for Federal--at least to reconsider the whole problem of financing presidential elections. That was their only responsibility. There is a committee in the Senate which has examined other methods of financing other campaigns. As I understand it, what you're referring to is the contributions by some individuals or groups to right-wing movements, not so much candidates--is that correct?;Q. Yes.;THE PRESIDENT. As long as they meet the requirements of the tax laws, I don't think that the Federal Government can interfere or should interfere with the right of any individual to take any position he wants. The only thing we should be concerned about is that it does not represent a diversion of funds which might be taxable to--for nontaxable purposes. But that is another question and I'm sure the Internal Revenue System examines.that. But I would not want to interfere with the right of any individual to give his own finances or support to any movement that he chooses to do so, providing it comes within the laws, the present laws of the United States.;[15.] Q. Mr. President, the General Assembly last night voted to urge all nations to take separate and collective action to force South Africa to abandon its racial policies. What specific steps would you favor the U.S. taking to implement that resolution?;THE PRESIDENT. I've not examined the language of the Assembly resolution so that I'm not able to answer that.;[16.] Q. Sir, last year before the session of Congress began you listed domestic and foreign legislation that would be "must" for that session of Congress. Can you at this time list your priorities for legislation in the upcoming Congress?;THE PRESIDNT. No, I think that the--I should do that in the State of the Union Address and we will. Quite obviously, we've touched on one of the matters which are of importance--civil defense. I talked previous to this about another matter which is medical care for the aged. But the general program I think should wait till January.;[17.] Q. Sir, could you clarify one thing? There seem to be confusion and conflicting reports about whether you are going to press for a more liberal trade policy. Has the decision been made on that yet?;THE PRESIDENT. A preliminary decision has been made in regard to the matter, yes, and will be announced in January. Once again there are some consultations which must be made and will be made with the members of Congress who have responsibility in the area in the month of December, and then we will go to the Congress in January with our program.;Q. Mr. President, Senator Goldwater has indicated his opposition to us becoming associated with the Common Market. Would you comment on that and perhaps sum up for us the possible effect the Common Market might have on the American economy?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I don't know what the word "associated" means in the question. I don't know anyone--I have not heard it proposed that the United States should become a member of the Common Market or associated with the Common Market in the sense that the word is ordinarily used.;What we are concerned about is that we have the power to negotiate with the Common Market to protect our export industry. Now the Common Market will represent a tremendously important market for American production. It is one of our areas where we have concentrated most on in recent years and will--and represents a tremendous potential for us in the future, particularly when Great Britain joins it. But we don't--we want to, therefore, protect our export market.;We want to keep the ratio of exports to imports comparable to what it is today or perhaps even improve it, because if we're not able to export substantially more than we import, we're going to either have to cut off all assistance to countries abroad or begin to withdraw our troops home.;We spend over $3 billion a year in keeping our bases and our troops abroad. That represents a $3 billion drain or potentially gold drain upon us. The only reason we've been able to afford that, of course, has been that we've had a balance of trade in our favor of around $5 billion.;Now in addition we are concerned that American companies who are locked out of the Common Market because of their high tariffs will feel that the only way that they can get into the market will be through investing in Western Europe, and therefore we will have capital leaving, which will cost jobs. Every time an American firm invests in Europe and builds its company there, it hires European workers and not American workers.;Now we believe in the free flow of capital. We do not believe in capital exchange here. Therefore we have to have the ability to negotiate with the Common Market so that American goods can enter the market and we will not have American capital jumping the wall in order to compete.;So that this is a matter of great importance to the American workers and industry and to the American economy, and it is in that--because of that reason, as well as our desire to associate as closely as we can to Europe, which is going to be such an important power and force, that we are considering what our trade program will be. But if you use the word "associate" with the Common Market, or "join" the Common Market, that is not an accurate description of our policy.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, do you favor, and did you urge on Chancellor Adenauer closer ties, particularly political ties between the two halves of Germany?;THE PRESIDENT. No. In answer to your first question, the reason I answer it with some hesitation is the question of "ties." At the present time, for example, as you know, the East Germans and West Germans do negotiate in regard to trade. So that we have to decide--and those negotiations may continue and we will have a clearer idea of what form they will take if we get into negotiation.;Political ties could be defined in so many ways that I think that unless you would be prepared to define it more precisely, I think the wiser thing would be to wait till we got into negotiation with the Soviet Union and then to determine what these relationships would be.;I think my interview on Saturday indicated my general view of the Federal Republic and its actions in the future.;[19.] Q. Mr. President, you have espoused more liberal trade barriers. Yet, the other day, you put machinery in motion that could result in a higher import duty on cotton textiles. Now I understand the Japanese have protested. How do you square your policy on lowering trade barriers with this sort of protectionist action?;THE PRESIDENT. I square it in an attempt to achieve a balance which serves the interest of the United States and those countries which are involved around the world.;I will point out that the United States does sell cotton at a price which is vastly lower than an American manufacturer can buy it for. We sell it at the world price which represents a contribution by the United States to each pound or bale of cotton which is sold abroad, which permits a manufacturer in a country around the world to buy their cotton much lower than our manufacturers, which puts our manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage.;We do that for obvious reasons. But we have to try to balance off those burdens.;[20.] Q. Mr. President, a Republican Congressman making answer to your speech in Los Angeles in which you criticized extremist groups went back to 1949 and got a speech you made in Salem, Mass., in which you reviewed the loss of mainland China, and found in that what he considered inconsistencies. Would you care to comment on your view then and now?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I always have felt that we did not make a determined enough effort in the case of China. Given the problems we now see, I think a more determined effort would have been advisable. I would think that in my speech in '49 I placed more emphasis on personalities than I would today.;And I would say that my view today is more in accordance with the facts than my view in '49. But my--I've always felt, and f think history will record, that the change of China from being a country friendly to us to a country which is unremittingly hostile affected very strongly the balance of power in the world. And while there were--there is still, of course, room for argument as to whether any United States actions would have changed the course of events there, I think a greater effort would have been wiser. I said it in '49, so it isn't totally hindsight.;[21.] Q. Mr. President, earlier you said that information would be made available to private citizens as to what they can do individually to protect against fallout. Do you have an opinion as to whether individuals should build private shelters or not?;THE PRESIDENT. I stated that we are going to send out a booklet when it is ready. I hoped it would be ready by the end of November. The booklet will reflect the decisions we made in November, and I think it will tell them what the Federal policy will be, what we hope to do, and what each individual can do in his own home, which will provide greater assurances if an attack should come.;I want to emphasize that the best defense still remains the American deterrent.;But I do think that within each individual home that some steps can be taken which are not expensive, but which would, if a disaster should strike us, provide a greater security, though of course, there is no security against blast.;And there is bound to be, particularly as these new weapons increase in power, there are obvious limits to what any of us can do. But in answer to your question, the booklet which will be sent out, I hope shortly, will inform each individual what he can do within his own home as well as within his community.;Reporter. Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Statement by the President on the Situation in the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">December 20, 1961</td><td class="c7">I WANT to make special note of the most encouraging developments in the Dominican Republic. The solution to the political difficulties in that country, the principal feature of which is the immediate creation of a council of state, was announced by President Balaguer on December 17 and has now been accepted by the principal elements of the democratic opposition. It represents, in my judgment, an impressive demonstration of statesmanship and responsibility by all concerned. This accomplishment by the democratic opposition and the Dominican government is all the more remarkable when it is recalled that only recently the Dominican Republic emerged from three decades of a harshly repressive regime which dedicated itself to stifling every democratic Dominican voice. This victory of the Dominican people and its leaders is a striking demonstration of the fact that dictatorship can suppress but cannot destroy the aspirations of a people to live in freedom, dignity and peace.;The Dominican people still face long and difficult efforts to transform their aspirations into an effective, soundly-based democratic system. In this struggle, they have the assurance of our sympathetic and tangible support. I understand that the Organization of American States is now considering the lifting of the sanctions imposed upon the Dominican Republic by collective action in August 1960 and January 1961. If the Council of the OAS takes such action--and our representatives are supporting that step we will resume diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic promptly. When this takes place the Department of Agriculture will authorize purchases under the Dominican allocation of non-quota sugar for the first six months of 1962.;In addition, I propose to send, upon the installation of the new council of state, a United States Economic Assistance Mission, headed by Ambassador Teodoro Moscoso of AID and including Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Milton Barall, to visit the Dominican Republic. Its purpose will be to explore emergency requirements and the possibilities for longer-range cooperative programs under the Alliance for Progress, which can be of direct benefit to the Dominican people. I expect that this mission will arrive in the Dominican Republic late this month or very early in January.;I understand that Mr. Felipe Herrera, President of the Inter-American Development Bank, will head a high-level mission to the Dominican Republic in the near future to begin discussions and inquire into economic and social development projects.;These actions are intended to assist the new Dominican government and people in developing a sound economic and social structure, which is indispensable to an enduring democratic political system.;The Dominican people and their leaders confront a great and seldom given opportunity: the construction of a democratic society on the ruins of tyranny. It is a noble task, but it is not an easy one. We wish them well, and we assure them of our desire to assist them in their efforts.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union.</td><td class="c6">January 11, 1962</td><td class="c7">[As delivered in person before a joint session];Mr. Vice President, my old colleague from Massachusetts and your new Speaker, John McCormack, Members of the 87th Congress, ladies and gentlemen;This week we begin anew our joint and separate efforts to build the American future. But, sadly, we build without a man who linked a long past with the present and looked strongly to the future. "Mister Sam" Rayburn is gone. Neither this House nor the Nation is the same without him.;Members of the Congress, the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress. We are all trustees for the American people, custodians of the American heritage. It is my task to report the State of the Union--to improve it is the task of us all.;In the past year, I have traveled not only across our own land but to other lands-to the North and the South, and across the seas. And I have found--as I am sure you have, in your travels--that people everywhere, in spite of occasional disappointments, look to us--not to our wealth or power, but to the splendor of our ideals. For our Nation is commissioned by history to be either an observer of freedom's failure or the cause of its success. Our overriding obligation in the months ahead is to fulfill the world's hopes by fulfilling our own faith.;1. STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY;That task must begin at home. For if we cannot fulfill our own ideals here, we cannot expect others to accept them. And when the youngest child alive today has grown to the cares of manhood, our position in the world will be determined first of all by what provisions we make today--for his education, his health, and his opportunities for a good home and a good job and a good life.;At home, we began the year in the valley of recession--we completed it on the high road of recovery and growth. With the help of new congressionally approved or administratively increased stimulants to our economy, the number of major surplus labor u areas has declined from 101 to 60, nonagricultural employment has increased by more than a million jobs, and the average factory work-week has risen to well over 40 hours. At year's end the economy which Mr. Khrushchev once called a "stumbling horse" was racing to new records in consumer spending, labor income, and industrial production.;We are gratified--but we are not satisfied. Too many unemployed are still looking for the blessings of prosperity- As those who leave our schools and farms demand new jobs, automation takes old jobs away. To expand our growth and job opportunities, I urge on the Congress three measures;(1) First, the Manpower Training and Development Act, to stop the waste of able-bodied men and women who want to work, but whose only skill has been replaced by a machine, or moved with a mill, or shut down with a mine;(2) Second, the Youth Employment Opportunities Act, to help train and place not only the one million young Americans who are both out of school and out of work, but the twenty-six million young Americans entering the labor market in this decade, and;(3) Third, the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment, which, combined with planned revisions of depreciation allowances, will spur our modernization, our growth, and our ability to compete abroad.;Moreover--pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery--let us not forget that we have suffered three recessions in the last 7 years. The time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining--by filling three basic gaps in our anti-recession protection. We need;(1) First, presidential standby authority, subject to congressional veto, to adjust personal income tax rates downward within a specified range and time, to slow down an economic decline before it has dragged us all down;(2) Second, presidential standby authority, upon a given rise in the rate of unemployment, to accelerate Federal and federally-aided capital improvement programs, and;(3) Third, a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation system--to maintain for our fellow citizens searching for a job who cannot find it, their purchasing power and their living standards without constant resort--as we have seen in recent years by the Congress and the administrations-to temporary supplements.;If we enact this six-part program, we can show the whole world that a free economy need not be an unstable economy--that a free system need not leave men unemployed--and that a free society is not only the most productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashioned by man.;II. FIGHTING INFLATION;But recession is only one enemy of a free economy--inflation is another. Last year, 1961, despite rising production and demand, consumer prices held almost steady--and wholesale prices declined. This is the best record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of World War II.;Inflation too often follows in the shadow of growth--while price stability is made easy by stagnation or controls. But we mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom.;Our first line of defense against inflation is the good sense and public spirit of business and labor--keeping their total increases in wages and profits in step with productivity. There is no single statistical test to guide each company and each union. But I strongly urge them--for their country's interest, and for their own--to apply the test of the public interest to these transactions.;Within this same framework of growth and wage-price stability;--This administration has helped keep our economy competitive by widening the access of small business to credit and Government contracts, and by stepping up the drive against monopoly, price-fixing, and racketeering;--We will submit a Federal Pay Reform bill aimed at giving our classified, postal, and other employees new pay scales more comparable to those of private industry;--We are holding the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level incurred after the last recession in 1958, and, finally;--I am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced Federal Budget.;This is a joint responsibility, requiring Congressional cooperation on appropriations, and on three sources of income in particular;(1) First, an increase in postal rates, to end the postal deficit;(2) Secondly, passage of the tax reforms previously urged, to remove unwarranted tax preferences, and to apply to dividends and to interest the same withholding requirements we have long applied to wages, and;(3) Third, extension of the present excise and corporation tax rates, except for those changes--which will be recommended in a message--affecting transportation.;III. GETTING AMERICA MOVING;But a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget. They require progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify our strength.;CITIES;A strong America depends on its cities-America's glory, and sometimes America's shame. To substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay, we have stepped up existing urban renewal and housing programs, and launched new ones--redoubled the attack on water pollution--speeded aid to airports, hospitals, highways, and our declining mass transit systems--and secured new weapons to combat organized crime, racketeering, and youth delinquency, assisted by the coordinated and hard-hitting efforts of our investigative services: the FBI, the Internal Revenue, the Bureau of Narcotics, and many others. We shall need further anti-crime, mass transit, and transportation legislation--and new tools to fight air pollution. And with all this effort under way, both equity and commonsense require that our nation's urban areas--containing three-fourths of our population--sit as equals at the Cabinet table. I urge a new Department of Urban Affairs and Housing.;AGRICULTURE AND RESOURCES;A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources. American farmers took heart in 1961--from a billion dollar rise in farm income--and from a hopeful start on reducing the farm surpluses. But we are still operating under a patchwork accumulation of old laws, which cost us $1 billion a year in CCC carrying charges alone, yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earnings.;Our task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent productivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our own countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures of the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all. Since 1950 our agricultural output per man-hour has actually doubled! Without new, realistic measures, it will someday swamp our farmers and our taxpayers in a national scandal or a farm depression.;I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm program--tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the sixties--and designed to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of commonsense.;We also need for the sixties--if we are to bequeath our full national estate to our heirs--a new long-range conservation and recreation program--expansion of our superb national parks and forests--preservation of our authentic wilderness areas-new starts on water and power projects as our population steadily increases--and expanded REA generation and transmission loans.;CIVIL RIGHTS;But America stands for progress in human rights as well as economic affairs, and a strong America requires the assurance of full and equal rights to all its citizens, of any race or of any color. This administration has shown as never before how much could be done through the full use of Executive powers--through the enforcement of laws already passed by the Congress-through persuasion, negotiation, and litigation, to secure the constitutional rights of all: the right to vote, the right to travel Without hindrance across State lines, and the right to free public education.;I issued last March a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all Federal agencies and contractors. The Vice President's Committee thus created has done much, including the voluntary "Plans for progress" which, in all sections of the country, are achieving a quiet but striking success in opening up to all races new professional, supervisory, and other job opportunities.;But there is much more to be done--by the Executive, by the courts, and by the Congress. Among the bills now pending before you, on which the executive departments will comment in detail, are appropriate methods of strengthening these basic rights which have our full support. The right to vote, for example, should no longer be denied through such arbitrary devices on a local level, sometimes abused, such as literacy tests and poll taxes. As we approach the 100th anniversary, next January, of the Emancipation Proclamation, let the acts of every branch of the Government--and every citizen--portray that "righteousness does exalt a nation.;HEALTH AND WELFARE;Finally, a strong America cannot neglect the aspirations of its citizens--the welfare of the needy, the health care of the elderly, the education of the young. For we are not developing the Nation's wealth for its own sake. Wealth is the means--and people are the ends. All our material riches will avail us little if we do not use them to expand the opportunities of our people.;Last year, we improved the diet of needy people--provided more hot lunches and fresh milk to school children built more college dormitories--and, for the elderly, expanded private housing, nursing homes, heath services, and social security. But we have just begun.;To help those least fortunate of all, I am recommending a new public welfare program, stressing services instead of support, rehabilitation instead of relief, and training for useful work instead of prolonged dependency.;To relieve the critical shortage of doctors and dentists--and this is a matter which should concern us all--and expand research, I urge action to aid medical and dental colleges and scholarships and to establish new National Institutes of Health.;To take advantage of modern vaccination achievements, I am proposing a mass immunization program, aimed at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemies of our children as polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus.;To protect our consumers from the careless and the unscrupulous, I shall recommend improvements in the Food and Drug laws-strengthening inspection and standards, halting unsafe and worthless products, preventing misleading labels, and cracking down on the illicit sale of habit-forming drugs.;But in matters of health, no piece of unfinished business is more important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the aged.;For our older citizens have longer and more frequent illnesses, higher hospital and medical bills and too little income to pay them. Private health insurance helps very few--for its cost is high and its coverage limited. Public welfare cannot help those too proud to seek relief but hard-pressed to pay their own bills. Nor can their children or grandchildren always sacrifice their own health budgets to meet this constant drain.;Social security has long helped to meet the hardships of retirement, death, and disability. I now urge that its coverage be extended without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly.;EDUCATION;Equally important to our strength is the quality of our education. Eight million adult Americans are classified as functionally illiterate. This is a disturbing figure--reflected in Selective Service rejection rates-reflected in welfare rolls and crime rates. And I shall recommend plans for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy.;I shall also recommend bills to improve educational quality, to stimulate the arts, and, at the college level, to provide Federal loans for the construction of academic facilities and federally financed scholarships.;If this Nation is to grow in wisdom and strength, then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talents. Yet nearly half lack either the funds or the facilities to attend college. Enrollments are going to double in our colleges in the short space of 10 years. The annual cost per student is skyrocketing to astronomical levels--now averaging $1,650 a year, although almost half of our families earn less than $5,000. They cannot afford such costs--but this Nation cannot afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower.;But excellence in education must begin at the elementary level. I sent to the Congress last year a proposal for Federal aid to public school construction and teachers' salaries. I believe that bill, which passed the Senate and received House Committee approval, offered the minimum amount required by our needs and--in terms of across-the-board aid--the maximum scope permitted by our Constitution. I therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill: and I urge its passage at this session.;Civilization," said H. G. Wells, "is a race between education and catastrophe." It is up to you in this Congress to determine the winner of that race.;These are not unrelated measures addressed to specific gaps or grievances in our national life. They are the pattern of our intentions and the foundation of our hopes. "I believe in democracy," said Woodrow Wilson, "because it releases the energy of every human being." The dynamic of democracy is the power and the purpose of the individual, and the policy of this administration is to give to the individual the opportunity to realize his own highest possibilities.;Our program is to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment, to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion, to offer to all the facilities for education and health and welfare, to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress, and thus to realize for all the full promise of American life.;IV. OUR GOALS ABROAD;All of these efforts at home give meaning to our efforts abroad. Since the close of the Second World War, a global civil war has divided and tormented mankind. But it is not our military might, or our higher standard of living, that has most distinguished us from our adversaries. It is our belief that the state is the servant of the citizen and not his master.;This basic clash of ideas and wills is but one of the forces reshaping our globe--swept as it is by the tides of hope and fear, by crises in the headlines today that become mere footnotes tomorrow. Both the successes and the setbacks of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business. For every apparent blessing contains the seeds of danger--every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope--and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable.;Yet our basic goal remains the same: a peaceful world community of free and independent states--free to choose their own future and their own system, so long as it does not threaten the freedom of others.;Some may choose forms and ways that we would not choose for ourselves--but it is not for us that they are choosing. We can welcome diversity--the Communists cannot. For we offer a world of choice--they offer the world of coercion. And the way of the past shows dearly that freedom, not coercion, is the wave of the future. At times our goal has been obscured by crisis or endangered by conflict--but it draws sustenance from five basic sources of strength;--the moral and physical strength of the United States;--the united strength of the Atlantic Community;--the regional strength of our Hemispheric relations;--the creative strength of our efforts in the new and developing nations, and;--the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations.;V. OUR MILITARY STRENGTH;Our moral and physical strength begins at home as already discussed. But it includes our military strength as well. So long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affairs of men, we must arm to deter others from aggression.;In the past 12 months our military posture has steadily improved. We increased the previous defense budget by 15 percent--not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace. We more than doubled our acquisition rate of Polaris submarines--we doubled the production capacity for Minuteman missiles--and increased by 50 percent the number of manned bombers standing ready on a 15 minute alert. This year the combined force levels planned under our new Defense budget--including nearly three hundred additional Polaris and Minuteman missiles--have been precisely calculated to insure the continuing strength of our nuclear deterrent.;But our strength may be tested at many levels. We intend to have at all times the capacity to resist non-nuclear or limited attacks--as a complement to our nuclear capacity, not as a substitute. We have rejected any all-or-nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation.;Thus we have doubled the number of ready combat divisions in the Army's strategic reserve--increased our troops in Europe--built up the Marines--added new sealift and airlift capacity--modernized our weapons and ammunition--expanded our anti-guerrilla forces--and increased the active fleet by more than 70 vessels and our tactical air forces by nearly a dozen wings.;Because we needed to reach this higher long-term level of readiness more quickly, 155,000 members of the Reserve and National Guard were activated under the Act of this Congress. Some disruptions and distress were inevitable. But the overwhelming majority bear their burdens--and their Nation's burdens--with admirable and traditional devotion.;In the coming year, our reserve programs will be revised--two Army Divisions will, I hope, replace those Guard Divisions on duty--and substantial other increases will boost our Air Force fighter units, the procurement of equipment, and our continental defense and warning efforts. The Nation's first serious civil defense shelter program is under way, identifying, marking, and stocking 50 million spaces, and I urge your approval of Federal incentives for the construction of public fall-out shelters in schools and hospitals and similar centers.;VI. THE UNITED NATIONS;But arms alone are not enough to keep the peace--it must be kept by men. Our instrument and our hope is the United Nations-and I see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world. For the troubles of a world organization merely reflect the troubles of the world itself. And if the organization is weakened, these troubles can only increase. We may not always agree with every detailed action taken by every officer of the United Nations, or with every voting majority. But as an institution, it should have in the future, as it has had in the past since its inception, no stronger or more faithful member than the United States of America.;In 1961 the peace-keeping strength of the United Nations was reinforced. And those who preferred or predicted its demise, envisioning a troika in the seat of Hammarskiold--or Red China inside the Assembly-have seen instead a new vigor, under a new Secretary General and a fully independent Secretariat. In making plans for a new forum and principles on disarmament for peace-keeping in outer space--for a decade of development effort--the UN fulfilled its Charter's lofty aim.;Eighteen months ago the tangled and turbulent Congo presented the UN with its gravest challenge. The prospect was one of chaos--or certain big-power confrontation, with all of its hazards and all of its risks, to us and to others. Today the hopes have improved for peaceful conciliation within a united Congo. This is the objective of our policy in this important area.;No policeman is universally popular-particularly when he uses his stick to restore law and order on his beat. Those members who are willing to contribute their votes and their views--but very little else--have created a serious deficit by refusing to pay their share of special UN assessments. Yet they do pay their annual assessments to retain their votes--and a new UN Bond issue, financing special operations for the next 18 months, is to be repaid with interest from these regular assessments. This is clearly in our interest. It will not only keep the UN solvent, but require all voting members to pay their fair share of its activities. Our share of special operations has long been much higher than our share of the annual assessment--and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation, and for these reasons, I am urging Congress to approve our participation.;With the approval of this Congress, we have undertaken in the past year a great new effort in outer space. Our aim is not simply to be first on the moon, any more than Charles Lindbergh's real aim was to be the first to Paris. His aim was to develop the techniques of our own country and other countries in the field of air and the atmosphere, and our objective in making this effort, which we hope will place one of our citizens on the moon, is to develop in a new frontier of science, commerce and cooperation, the position of the United States and the Free World.;This Nation belongs among the first to explore it, and among the first--if not the first--we shall be. We are offering our know-how and our cooperation to the United Nations. Our satellites will soon be providing other nations with improved weather observations. And I shall soon send to the Congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an International Communications Satellite system, in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy.;But peace in space will help us naught once peace on earth is gone. World order will be secured only when the whole world has laid down these weapons which seem to offer us present security but threaten the future survival of the human race. That armistice day seems very far away. The vast resources of this planet are being devoted more and more to the means of destroying, instead of enriching, human life.;But the world was not meant to be a prison in which man awaits his execution. Nor has mankind survived the tests and trials of thousands of years to surrender everything-including its existence--now. This Nation has the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear tests--and we will persist until we prevail, until the rule of law has replaced the ever dangerous use of force.;VII. LATIN AMERICA;I turn now to a prospect of great promise: our Hemispheric relations. The Alliance for Progress is being rapidly transformed from proposal to program. Last month in Latin America I saw for myself the quickening of hope, the revival of confidence, the new trust in our country--among workers and farmers as well as diplomats. We have pledged our help in speeding their economic, educational, and social progress. The Latin American Republics have in turn pledged a new and strenuous effort of self-help and self-reform.;To support this historic undertaking, I am proposing--under the authority contained in the bills of the last session of the Congress--a special long-term Alliance for Progress fund of $3 billion. Combined with our Food for Peace, Export-Import Bank, and other resources, this will provide more than $1 billion a year in new support for the Alliance. In addition, we have increased twelve-fold our Spanish and Portuguese language broadcasting in Latin America,.and improved Hemispheric trade and defense. And while the blight of communism has been increasingly exposed and isolated in the Americas, liberty has scored a gain. The people of the Dominican Republic, with our firm encouragement and help, and those of our sister Republics of this Hemisphere are safely passing through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy.;VIII. THE NEW AND DEVELOPING NATIONS;Our efforts to help other new or developing nations, and to strengthen their stand for freedom, have also made progress. A newly unified Agency for International Development is reorienting our foreign assistance to emphasize long-term development loans instead of grants, more economic aid instead of military, individual plans to meet the individual needs of the nations, and new standards on what they must do to marshal their own resources.;A newly conceived Peace Corps is winning friends and helping people in fourteen countries--supplying trained and dedicated young men and women, to give these new nations a hand in building a society, and a glimpse of the best that is in our country. If there is a problem here, it is that we cannot supply the spontaneous and mounting demand.;A newly-expanded Food for Peace Pro-. gram is feeding the hungry of many lands with the abundance of our productive farms--providing lunches for children in school, wages for economic development, relief for the victims of flood and famine, and a better diet for millions whose daily bread is their chief concern.;These programs help people, and, by helping people, they help freedom. The views of their governments may sometimes be very different from ours--but events in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe teach us never to write off any nation as lost to the Communists- That is the lesson of our time. We support the independence of those newer or weaker states whose history, geography, economy or lack of power impels them to remain outside "entangling alliances"--as we did for more than a century. For the independence of nations is a bar to the Communists' "grand design"-it is the basis of our own.;In the past year, for example, we have urged a neutral and independent Laos-regained there a common policy with our major allies--and insisted that a cease-fire precede negotiations. While a workable formula for supervising its independence is still to be achieved, both the spread of war-which might have involved this country also--and a Communist occupation have thus far been prevented.;A satisfactory settlement in Laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in Viet-Nam--where the foe is increasing his tactics of terror--where our own efforts have been stepped up--and where the local government has initiated new programs and reforms to broaden the base of resistance. The systematic aggression now bleeding that country is not a "war of liberation"--for Viet-Nam is already free. It is a war of attempted subjugation--and it will be resisted.;IX. THE ATLANTIC COMMUNITY;Finally, the united strength of the Atlantic Community has flourished in the last year under severe tests. NATO has increased both the number and the readiness of its air, ground, and naval units--both its nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities. Even greater efforts by all its members are still required. Nevertheless our unity of purpose and will has been, I believe, immeasurably strengthened.;The threat to the brave city of Berlin remains. In these last 6 months the Allies have made it unmistakably clear that our presence in Berlin, our free access thereto, and the freedom of two million West Berliners would not be surrendered either to force or through appeasement--and to maintain those rights and obligations, we are prepared to talk, when appropriate, and to fight, if necessary. Every member of NATO stands with us in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man's will to remain free.;I cannot now predict the course of future negotiations over Berlin. I can only say that we are sparing no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem. I believe such a resolution can be found, and with it an improvement in our relations with the Soviet Union, if only the leaders in the Kremlin will recognize the basic rights and interests involved, and the interest of all mankind in peace.;But the Atlantic Community is no longer concerned with purely military aims. As its common undertakings grow at an ever-increasing pace, we are, and increasingly will be, partners in aid, trade, defense, diplomacy, and monetary affairs.;The emergence of the new Europe is being matched by the emergence of new ties across the Atlantic. It is a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundreds of workaday tasks: of currencies kept in effective relation, of development loans meshed together, of standardized weapons, and concerted diplomatic positions. The Atlantic Community grows, not like a volcanic mountain, by one mighty explosion, but like a coral reef, from the accumulating activity of all.;Thus, we in the free world are moving steadily toward unity and cooperation, in the teeth of that old Bolshevik prophecy, and at the very time when extraordinary rumbles of discord can be heard across the Iron Curtain. It is not free societies which bear within them the seeds of inevitable disunity.;X. OUR BALANCE OF PAYMENTS;On one special problem, of great concern to our friends, and to us, I am proud to give the Congress an encouraging report. Our efforts to safeguard the dollar are progressing. In the 11 months preceding last February 1, we suffered a net loss of nearly $2 billion in gold. In the 11 months that followed, the loss was just over half a billion dollars. And our deficit in our basic transactions with the rest of the world--trade, defense, foreign aid, and capital, excluding volatile short-term flows--has been reduced from $2 billion for 1960 to about one-third that amount for 1961. Speculative fever against the dollar is ending--and confidence in the dollar has been restored.;We did not--and could not--achieve these gains through import restrictions, troop withdrawals, exchange controls, dollar devaluation or choking off domestic recovery. We acted not in panic but in perspective. But the problem is not yet solved. Persistently large deficits would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense commitments abroad. Our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payments. With the cooperation of the Congress, business, labor, and our major allies, that goal can be reached.;We shall continue to attract foreign tourists and investments to our shores, to seek increased military purchases here by our allies, to maximize foreign aid procurement from American firms, to urge increased aid from other fortunate nations to the less fortunate, to seek tax laws which do not favor investment in other industrialized nations or tax havens, and to urge coordination of allied fiscal and monetary policies So as to discourage large and disturbing capital movements.;TRADE;Above all, if we are to pay for our commitments abroad, we must expand our exports. Our businessmen must be export conscious and export competitive. Our tax policies must spur modernization of our plants--our wage and price gains must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on prices--our export credit and promotion campaigns for American industries must continue to expand.;But the greatest challenge of all is posed by the growth of the European Common Market. Assuming the accession of the United Kingdom, there will arise across the Atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff similar to ours with an economy which nearly equals our own. Will we in this country adapt our thinking to these new prospects and patterns--or will we wait until events have passed us by?;This is the year to decide. The Reciprocal Trade Act is expiring. We need a new law--a wholly new approach--a bold new instrument of American trade policy. Our decision could well affect the unity of the West, the course of the Cold War, and the economic growth of our Nation for a generation to come.;If we move decisively, our factories and farms can increase their sales to their richest, fastest-growing market. Our exports will increase. Our balance of payments position will improve. And we will have forged across the Atlantic a trading partnership with vast resources for freedom.;If, on the other hand, we hang back in deference to local economic pressures, we will find ourselves cut off from our major allies. Industries--and I believe this is most vital--industries will move their plants and jobs and capital inside the walls of the Common Market, and jobs, therefore, will be lost here in the United States if they cannot otherwise compete for its consumers. Our farm surpluses--our balance of trade, as you all know, to Europe, the Common Market, in farm products, is nearly three or four to one in our favor, amounting to one of the best earners of dollars in our balance of payments structure, and without entrance to this Market, without the ability to enter it, our farm surpluses will pile up in the Middle West, tobacco in the South, and other commodities, which have gone through Western Europe for 15 years. Our balance of payments position will worsen. Our consumers, will lack a wider choice of goods at lower prices. And millions of American workers-whose jobs depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of exports or imports, or whose jobs will be endangered by the movement of our capital to Europe, or whose jobs can be maintained only in. an expanding economy--these millions of workers in your home States and mine will see their real interests sacrificed.;Members of the Congress: The United States did not rise to greatness by waiting for others to lead. This Nation is the world's foremost manufacturer, farmer, banker, consumer, and exporter. The Common Market is moving ahead at an economic growth rate twice ours. The Communist economic offensive is under way. The opportunity is ours--the initiative is up to us--and I believe that 1962 is the time.;To seize that initiative, I shall shortly send to the Congress a new five-year Trade Expansion Action, far-reaching in scope but designed with great care to make certain that its benefits to our people far outweigh any risks. The bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariffs here in the United States and in the Common Market on those items in which we together supply 80 percent of the world's trade--mostly items in which our own ability to compete is demonstrated by the fact that we sell abroad, in these items, substantially more than we import. This step will make it possible for our major industries to compete with their counterparts in Western Europe for access to European consumers.;On other goods the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duties up to 50 percent-permitting bargaining by major categories-and provide for appropriate and tested forms of assistance to firms and employees adjusting to import competition. We are not neglecting the safeguards provided by peril points, an escape clause, or the National Security Amendment. Nor are we abandoning our non-European friends or our traditional "most-favored nation" principle. On the contrary, the bill will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural products, so important to our friends in Latin America, who have long depended upon the European market, who now find themselves faced with new challenges which we must join with them in overcoming.;Concessions, in this bargaining, must of course be reciprocal, not unilateral. The Common Market will not fulfill its own high promise unless its outside tariff walls are low. The dangers of restriction or timidity in our own policy have counterparts for our friends in Europe. For together we face a common challenge: to enlarge the prosperity of free men everywhere--to build in partnership a new trading community in which all free nations may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort.;These various elements in our foreign policy lead, as I have said, to a single goal--the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states. This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future--a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.;We will not reach that goal today, or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our own lifetime. But the quest is the greatest adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices. But there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility.;A year ago, in assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger. This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did a year ago. For it is the fate of this generation-of you in the Congress and of me as President--to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom.;And in this high endeavor, may God watch over the United States of America.</td></tr>

Kennedy: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">January 15, 1962</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. [1] I have just one announcement. I am sure you are all familiar with the story in this morning's paper of the documentation on the study of comparisons of those in our schools and universities and the kind of subjects which they study which was published by the National Science Foundation. This has been a matter of some concern to me for some time because one of the most critical problems facing this Nation is the inadequacy of the supply of scientific and technical manpower, to satisfy the expanding requirements of this country's research and development efforts in the near future. In 1951 our universities graduated 19,600 students in the physical sciences. In 1960 in spite of the substantial increase in our population, during the last 10 years, and in spite of the fact that the demand for people of skill in this field has tremendously increased with our efforts in defense and space, industrial research, and all of the rest, in 1960 the number had fallen from 19,600 to 17,100. In 1951 there were 22,500 studying in the biological sciences, in 1960 there were only 16,700. In the field of engineering, enrollment rose from 232,000 to 269,000 in the period 1951 to 1957. Since 1957 there has been a continual decline in enrollment. Last year the figure was down to 240,000.;This is a matter of growing concern. It is more than a matching of numerical supply to anticipate a demand, though this alone would be difficult. Because of the seriousness of this problem for the long-range future of the United States, I have asked my Science Advisory Committee, in cooperation with the Federal Council for Science and Technology, to review available studies and other pertinent information, and to report to me as quickly as possible on the specific measures that can be taken within and without the Government to develop the necessary and well qualified scientists and engineers and technicians to meet our society's complex needs--governmental, educational, and industrial.;In undertaking this task, the committee will draw on the advice and assistance of individuals and agencies, including the National Academy of Sciences, which will shortly begin at my request a new study of scientific and technical manpower utilization.;To all those who may be within the sound of my voice or who may follow your stories in the papers, I want to emphasize the great new and exciting field of the sciences and while we wish to emphasize always the liberal arts, I do believe that these figures indicate a need on the national level and also a great opportunity for talented young men and women. And I hope that their teachers, their school boards, and they themselves and their families will give this matter consideration in developing their careers.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, as you are aware, there has been nothing official on this, but there have been some unofficial reports stemming.from Ambassador Thompson's first two exploratory conferences in Moscow. These reports are to the effect that the situation with Russia has not changed.;Could you tell us, sir, whether as a result of Mr. Thompson's two meetings in Moscow that you detect any evidence, new evidence, of a possible solution of our differences with Russia over Berlin?;THE PRESIDENT. I think--it's my hope that these talks will continue, so that this, matter will be subjected to the most thorough scrutiny and examination, to see whether such an arrangement is possible. Ambassador Thompson, I am hopeful, therefore, will meet with the Foreign Minister again and after these meetings have gone on for a reasonable period, we can make a much more concise judgment in answer to your question. But I think it would be premature today.;Q. Mr. President, in that connection, could you give us any idea of the length of a reasonable period of time?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I think it would really depend upon what was happening during the negotiations. In other words, if progress were being made, or if there were evidence that progress could be made, of course, then the time would be different than it would be if there was no evidence of any meeting of minds. So I think the important thing now is to continue and I'm--Ambassador Thompson will.;[3.] Q. Mr. President, the United States has made informal but strenuous efforts to reach a peaceful solution of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. Could you say, sir, if your hopes are in any way possible of fulfillment now, and if our efforts should fail, would we then turn to the United Nations?;THE PRESIDENT, We do not have any more precise information than the news story with which you are familiar in regard to the statement of the Dutch. We have been extremely anxious that a peaceful accommodation be reached in this matter and have used our influence to bring that about. I am particularly glad that the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. U Thant, has been occupying himself with a good deal of energy to try to see if there is a possibility for a peaceful settlement.;I am hopeful that both parties will respond to his efforts, and that we can prevent an outbreak of hostilities between Indonesia and the Dutch. Great responsibility rests on both of these countries, and I am hopeful that they will give Mr. U Thant every cooperation because the alternative would not be happy for the world, nor, really, I think, in the long run, for the parties involved. A peaceful solution, of course, would be the best thing and that's what we're working for.;[4.] Q. Mr. President, this is a question about your trade liberalization program. Some members of Congress from industrial areas are reporting privately that they are worried about the problems of their support of the program because some of their manufacturing constituents say that unless they are able to get things, for example, like wool and cotton, at world market prices instead of artificial prices, that they can't afford to go along with the idea of reducing trade barters. Can you give us your assessment of how serious you think this problem is and do you see any possible encouragement to them on it?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, of course, there are two different--one is cotton, which is in surplus here in the United States, and the other is wool, which we import. In the case of cotton, as you know, we send out, export, about 6 million bales of cotton a year, and we import about 600,000 manufactured bales, textiles. In fact, we export almost as much cotton, manufactured textiles, as we import. So the export of cotton is a very important ingredient in our balance of payments.;I think the Japanese alone buy, I think, almost $240 or $250 million of cotton. I believe, as I said before, that while some industries may not get the same benefit out of this proposal as others will, that generally, it will be very helpful to industry and very helpful to agriculture and most helpful to the United States.;And I think that if the members of Congress begin to examine the figures in their districts and in their States, and these figures are being prepared which show where the balance of trade runs, then I think that we can get a majority support for the legislation. A good deal of concern is expressed about Japan, but we ran a half billion dollar balance of trade in our favor. We sold Japan last year a half billion dollars more than they bought from us. So that I believe the United States can compete.;As I said the other day, the fact is that the Common Market countries have had an extraordinary economic growth, full employment and all the rest, and it is to increase our employment and our opportunities that we are recommending this. So in answer to your question, I believe that when the members of the House and Senate have examined our proposal, examined its safeguards, examined what it can do for employment, I am hopeful, in fact, I feel it very possible, that we can secure a majority, even though it's a sophisticated matter and it is difficult to explain quickly. But I think that when the educational job is done, I think the country will understand that it is in our best interest.;[5.] Q. Mr. President, are American troops now in combat in Viet-Nam?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;[6.] Q. Mr. President, Secretary Freeman has said that it's impossible to expand the food-for-peace program and Mr. McGovern says it should be expanded. Have you been able to resolve this difference?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it should be expanded as we can. I think that Mr. Freeman's concern is with, first, the regular markets of trade, that the food for peace should complement it and not cut across it, the obligations we have to others who are also exporters of agricultural commodities, the question of funds and finances, of how much--if we're talking about the $2 billion a year, which we are now. I am hopeful that we can use our productive power well in this field, but I think that the question of the balance, and I think that Mr. McGovern and Mr. Freeman in my judgment will be in balance by the time they go before the Congress, because I think they both have the same basic interests in using our food well and not having it wasted--in storage.;[7.] Q. What can you tell us about the administration's efforts to speed up the bargaining timetable in the steel industry, and what do you hope to accomplish by this?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I was hopeful, of course, from the beginning that an agreement would be reached in the steel industry, which would be, as I said in my letter to Mr. McDonald, which would be within the range of productivity and price stability, and which would come at a time, though I have not said this before, would come at a time which would prevent a repetition of what we saw in 1958 where there was a tremendous increase in inventory, in the first 6 months of the year which adversely affected the economy in the last half of the year, and also adversely affected employment in the steel mills themselves. So while they worked at high capacity for the first 6 months, there were a good many layoffs after the strike.;Now, if an agreement can be reached between the steel companies and the steel union, of course it would be well to have it come early, so that the country and the consumers of steel would be able to make their plans for the future without stockpiling.;Now this is a judgment for them. This is a free economy, and the Federal Government has no power unless there was a strike which affects the national emergency, but Secretary Goldberg is available for whatever good offices he may perform.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, after 1 year in the office of the Presidency, would you care to give us any of your comments about the first year and perhaps in particular the most rewarding and disappointing events that have come across your desk?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I would say the most disappointing event was our failure to get an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing, because I think that that might have been a very important step in easing the tension and preventing a proliferation of the weapons, and also in making it more possible for us to have progress on disarmament and some of the other matters that divide us. The thing that I think is the most heartening is the fact that first I think there's a greater surge for unity in the Western nations, and in our relations with Latin America, and also I think it has become more obvious that people do desire to be free and independent. And while they may organize their societies in different ways, they do want to maintain a national sovereignty, which I would regard as a great source of strength to us. I've had other disappointments but those are important.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, in the past it would seem that coalition governments lean toward Communist control. Are we then taking a chance in supporting a coalition type government in southeast Asia?;THE PRESIDENT. We are taking a chance in all of southeast Asia, and we're taking a chance in other areas. Nobody can make any predictions for the future, really, on any matter in which there are powerful interests at stake. I think, however, that we have to consider what our alternatives are, and what the prospects for war are in that area if we fail in our present efforts and the geographic problems which have to be surmounted in such a military engagement, where there is no easy entrance by sea and where the geographic location is extremely a long way from us and very dose to those who might become involved. So that there's no easy, sure answer for Laos, but it is my judgment that it is in the best interests of our country to work for a neutral and independent Laos. We are attempting to do that. And I can assure you that I recognize the risks that are involved. But I also think that we should consider the risks if we fail, and particularly of the possibility of escalation of a military struggle in a place of danger. So we're going to attempt to work out this matter in a way which permits us to try.;[10.] Q. Mr. President, the Inter-American foreign ministers are due to meet at Punta del Este next Monday. In advance of that meeting, could you tell us what kind of action you hope the meeting will take to check Castroism?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it is the consensus of the hemisphere that communism is a threat, that it's sustained and supported by alien forces, that it has no place in the Inter-American system, and that we are against dictatorships of the right and left. And now that the Dominican Republic is moving from a dictatorship of the right, we are hopeful that there will be--the voice of the hemisphere will speak against dictatorships of the left which are sustained and supported from outside the hemisphere. I think that we will get that consensus.;[11.] Q. Mr. President, the agricultural proposals now under preparation appear to involve a good deal of control of production and marketing by the Government. Following your long conference with Secretary Freeman, do you now hold the view that if the Government is to continue farm price support programs, there must be control or management of production?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, management--I think what we are attempting to do is to prevent the surpluses which we are able to produce because of the extraordinary productivity of our farms. I said the other day m the State of the Union Address that our per capita production has increased nearly 100 percent in the last 10 years, which is faster than our consumption is increasing, and as we have somewhat more difficulty maintaining some of our markets abroad, in my judgment we should attempt to provide with the support of the farmers and the Congress a reasonable balance which will protect their income. Otherwise, these surpluses will break the farmers' income, or they will be piled up so high in the sheds of the United States in storage that the whole program of trying to assist farmers will fall into discredit, and the farmer himself will be damaged. So what we are attempting to do--and this is extremely difficult because of the variety of opinions that are involved--is to try to work with the farmer and the Congress to try to bring about a balance between production for our domestic use, for our world use, for food for peace, and at the same time insure that the farmer's income will not be broken by surpluses, as it was to a substantial extent in the twenties. And that's our effort, and I think it's essential that we succeed if the public interest and the farmers are going to be protected.;[12.] Q. Mr. President, this has to do with the conduct of our judicial system. In the last several years at least two Federal judges have resigned from the bench to go back to practice law. Since Federal judges are appointed for life, would you care to comment on the possible impact of this type of resignation on the judicial system, and its effect upon the ethical standards of the community?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that the reason that they are appointed for life is so that there cannot only be no actual improprieties, but no appearance of improprieties. And while I would not make any judgment in the two cases you mentioned, I don't think that anyone should accept a Federal judgeship unless they're prepared to fill it for life, because I think the maintenance of the integrity of the judiciary is so important. So I hope that all judges will stay to the end of their terms.;[13.] Q. Sir, last April, during the generals' revolt in Algeria, you made an offer, but it was not clear from here whether it was of support or offer of aid to General de Gaulle. If a similar instance should occur in the near future, would you make a similar offer to President de Gaulle of either support or aid?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think that you've described completely, precisely, the kind of message which I sent to General de Gaulle. And I think that probably proffer of assistance would not be a precise description of it. If we felt that--I would think it would be unwise to speculate about the future. But this was a matter which was handled by the French, and no request was made for assistance, and none was offered.;[14-] Q. Mr. President, in the case of Kashmir, India has failed to keep its promise to hold free elections and has resorted with impunity in attacking Goa on December 17th. Could you tell us what the United States could do to assure that a double standard of action does not arise in the United Nations?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there are several different questions. We are against a double standard of action in the United Nations, and I think we have attempted to make that clear, and that double standard goes to a whole variety of different things, not just the matters that you mentioned in your question.;Now, on the matter of Kashmir, we have been and are concerned that an accommodation or a solution be reached because both countries have numerous external and internal problems. And we have been assisting both countries to build a more viable economy and quite obviously everything that is put to arms as a result of their friction's, of course, takes it from the general effort, and we're going to continue our efforts.;[15.] Q. Mr. President, there are two appeals pending in the Office of Emergency Planning that relate to foreign trade. One seeks protection for the textile industry and the other seeks a reduction in import restrictions on residual oil. Could you tell us what progress is being made on these appeals and, in particular, if any recommendation has come to you?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we did make a recommendation about a month ago on residual oil which provided for some increase in the amount that could be imported in, I think most of it from Venezuela. In the matter of textiles, that is one of the subjects which was part of our seven-point proposal to the textile industry, that we would consider.;We have made some progress with the textile industry--the voluntary agreement, which was made by the Under Secretary, Mr. Ball, which is trying to bring about a happier distribution of textile production in a way that doesn't cause dumping. I think that that's been a help to the textile industry-the change we made in depreciation allowances. There are other matters we're now looking into, and this is one of them. But it is a fact that the importation of textiles this year, which had gone from about 4 to 7 percent from '58 to '60, was down for various reasons to 6 percent, so that the import situation was somewhat eased for the textile industry. But to answer your question, both of these matters are before us.;[16.] Q. Mr. President, criticism that we did not tear down the Berlin wall seems to be increasing rather than declining. Just about a week ago the Chairman of the Republican National Committee criticized your administration very strenuously. I don't recall that you've ever publicly discussed this particular phase of the question. Do you think it would be helpful for you to do so now?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have discussed it. I stated that no one at that time in any position of responsibility--and I would use that term-either in the West Berlin-American contingent, in West Germany, France, or Great Britain, suggested that the United States or the other countries go in and tear down the wall.;The Soviet Union had had a de facto control for many years, really stretching back to the late forties in East Berlin. It had been turned over as a capital for East Germany a long time ago. And the United States has a very limited force surrounded by a great many divisions. We are going to find ourselves severely challenged to maintain what we have considered to be our basic rights--which is our presence in West Berlin and the right of access to West Berlin, and the freedom of the people of West Berlin.;But in my judgment, I think that you could have had a very violent reaction which might have taken us down a very rocky road, and I think it was for that reason and because it was recognized by those people in positions of responsibility that no recommendation was made along the lines you've suggested at that time. Hindsight is--;[17.] Q. It's been more than 4 months since the Soviets began their series of nuclear tests in the atmosphere, and I think you'd agree it would only be imprudent not to assume--to assume that they're not preparing further tests. Can you discuss what the overriding considerations are to cause us to give this potential enemy a gift of that length of time, and can you also tell us when we may expect a decision on your part in this matter of testing in the atmosphere?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as you know, we have tested underground, so that in talking about the gift of time, that matter should be taken into consideration. Secondly, of course, we were negotiating at the table in Geneva when the Soviet Union, after many months of preparation, began its tests.;I have announced that we are making our preparations to conduct atmospheric testing if it's considered to be in the public interest when those preparations are completed. So that it's wholly impossible for a free country like the United States, with a free press, to prepare in secret the extensive--make extensive preparations which would be necessary, at the same time we are conducting a very important and vital negotiation. So that the Soviet Union has that advantage. They have advantages as a dictatorship in this cold war struggle. But they have very serious disadvantages, and I think that we have to balance them one against the other.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, during the election campaign you pledged that if elected you would issue an executive order prohibiting racial segregation in federally assisted housing. It's recently been reported that you have decided to postpone the issuance of such an order for some time. I wondered if you could give us your thinking on this timing question--why you want to put it off?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think--I have stated that I would issue that order when I considered it to be in the public interest, and when I considered it to make an important contribution to advancing the rights of our citizens. I will point out that this administration in the last 12 months made more progress in the field of civil rights on a whole variety of fronts than were made in the last 8 years. We have, for example, carried out a great many more suits in voting rights, the appointment of Federal employees, and judges, and their employees, and ending segregation in interstate travel and terminal facilities, the ICC's work, and the work being done in railroad and airports, and we have had--at least the communities involved made important progress in integrating in this field.;So we are proceeding ahead in a way which will maintain a consensus, and which will advance this cause. And I think a proper judgment can be made on this and all other matters relating to equality of rights at the end of this year, and at the end of our term. In my judgment we are going to make significant progress and I am fully conscious of the wording of the statement to which you refer, and plan to meet my responsibilities in regard to this matter.;[19-] Q. Mr. President, would you care to comment on how the bond issue of the United Nations can tip the scale in favor of the United States?;THE PRESIDENT. Can do what?;Q. Can tip the scale in favor of the United States.;THE PRESIDENT. I think it can help us strengthen the United Nations, which I think is in the interest of the United States, and I think that if we do not have a bond issue, or a satisfactory substitute, and I have not heard of one, in my judgment the U.N. will go, sail, into very difficult weather in regard to its financing, and could be on the verge of bankruptcy. And I think this is a way, along with the decision which will be rendered by the Court in regard to the payment of their obligations--this is a way to spread the burden more equitably and insure the United Nations has adequate funds. Now, I look at what is happening in the Congo, where progress is being made towards the establishment of an independent Congo, and if Mr. Tshombe and the Prime Minister, based on their agreement at Kitona, can continue to make progress, we may have a real hope there.;So in my opinion, the United Nations justifies the effort we put into it substantially. We rely very heavily, as I said earlier today, on the Secretary General in regard to what is happening now in western New Guinea and Indonesia. So that I believe in it strongly, and I think that this is a way to strengthen it which tips the scale, I think, in the interest of peace, and those nations that wish to be free.;[20.] Q. Mr. President, this afternoon 2,000 American women, many of them from distant places, demonstrated in a downpour in front of the White House in behalf of disarmament and peace. Do you consider this sort of demonstration useful and does it have an influence on you and other world leaders who are responsible for peace?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think these women are extremely earnest and that they are as concerned as we all are at the possibility of a nuclear war. They talked this morning to Mr. Fisher, who is the Deputy Director of our disarmament agency. We stressed the effort we were going to put into the disarmament conference coming up in March. I saw the ladies myself. I recognized why they were there. There were a great number of them. It was in the rain. I understood what they were attempting to say, and therefore I considered that their message was received.;[21.] Q. Mr. President, almost precisely a year ago, President Eisenhower in his farewell address discussed the influence of the military-industrial alliance in the defense spending program. I wonder, sir, if, in your first year in office, you have developed similar concern for this problem.;THE PRESIDENT. I think that President Eisenhower commented on a matter which deserves continuing attention by the President and also by the Secretary of Defense. There gets to be a great vested interest in expenditures because of the employment that is involved, and all the rest, and that's one of the struggles which he had and which we have, and I think his warning or his words were well taken.;[22.] Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the recent negotiations in the Common Market moving into the second phase, their negotiations with us on agricultural products?;THE PRESIDENT. We have had a long negotiation, stretching back over 18 months, on the matter with the Common Market. We sent over Mr. Petersen and the Under Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Murphy, in December. We sent them back again this week. The arrangement which has been developed in the last few days has improved our position. We always will have--and I believe that this is one of the arguments for the powers which I requested from the Congress--a difficult struggle with agricultural productivity rising in Europe, with the balance of agricultural trade. We are sending to the Common Market about a billion one hundred million and taking back about two hundred million from them--it's quite obvious that it's impossible for us to trade evenly with them on agriculture.;So, therefore, we have to trade across the board. Given the difficulties which the Common Market is now running into with agriculture, and which we will see more of when the British negotiations get advanced, I would think that this looks like, from all the information I have, this looks like the best arrangement that we could make and seems to be in the public interest and is, I think, on the whole, satisfactory.;[23.] Q. Sir, there has been much to-do in the papers recently about memberships in various clubs affecting the members of your administration, having to do with the Cosmos Club and the Metropolitan Club, with which you are familiar.;Sir, do you have any particular standards of your own which you apply in your own case as to memberships in various clubs, as to whether they should be coeducational or biracial?;THE PRESIDENT. I have said from the beginning that I thought this was a personal matter which involved not only the members of this Government, but involves everyone in the city and everyone in the country, and every individual must make his judgment in the way that he believes to be right. And I've stated that my application for the Cosmos Club was not being renewed.;[24.] Q. Mr. President, you did not specifically mention doctors in your opening statement. If you get Medicare legislation, where would you get the doctors, nurses, and hospitals to furnish the old people's needs?;THE PRESIDENT. I was talking about scientists on this occasion, but as you know we have asked in the State of the Union Address for some assistance to medical schools and nursing schools. The fact of the matter is that our doctors are falling far behind the rate of increase in our population, and we are going to find it increasingly difficult to serve our people well. I don't think the solution should be to deny medical care to people, however. I think we can do much better than that, and I would suggest that the best remedy would be to assist us in the program we recommended to strengthen our medical schools so we can get the doctors we need.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Address on the first Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress.</td><td class="c6">March 13, 1962</td><td class="c7">Mr. Vice President, Ambassadors from our sister Republics, members of the OAS, the nine wise men upon whom so much depends, Members of the Congress, whom I am very glad to see here today--on whom we depend so much in guiding and supporting and stimulating and directing our policies in this Hemisphere--Ambassador Moscoso, the Coordinator of the Alliance for Progress, gentlemen;One year ago, on a similar occasion, I proposed the Alliance for Progress. That was the conception, but the birth did not take place until some months later, at Punta del Este. That was a suggestion for a continent-wide cooperative effort to satisfy the basic needs of the American people for homes, work, land, health and schools, for political liberty and the dignity of the spirit.;Our mission, I said, was "to complete the revolution of the Americas--to build a Hemisphere where all men can hope for a suitable standard of living--and all can live out their lives in dignity and freedom.;I then requested a meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council to consider the proposal. And, seven months ago, at Punta del Este, that Council met and adopted the Charter which established the Alianza para el Progreso and declared, and I quote, "We, the American Republics, hereby proclaim our decision to unite in a common effort to bring our people accelerated economic progress and broader social justice within the framework of personal dignity and individual liberty.;Together, the free nations of the Hemisphere pledged their resources and their energies to the Alliance for Progress. Together they pledged to accelerate economic and social development and to make the basic reforms that are necessary to ensure that all would participate in the fruits of this development. Together they pledged to modernize tax structures and land tenure-to wipe out illiteracy and ignorance-to promote health and provide decent housing-to solve the problems of commodity stabilization--to maintain sound fiscal and monetary policies--to secure the contributions of private enterprise to development-to speed the economic integration of Latin America. And together they established the basic institutional framework for this immense, decade-long development.;This historic Charter marks a new step forward in the history of our Hemisphere. It is a reaffirmation of the continued vitality of our Inter-American system, a renewed proof of our ability to meet the challenges and perils of our time, as our predecessors met these challenges in their own days.;In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century we struggled to provide political independence in this Hemisphere.;In the early twentieth century we worked to bring about a fundamental equality between all the nations of this Hemisphere one with another--to strengthen the machinery of regional cooperation within a framework of mutual respect, and under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt and the Good Neighbor Policy that goal was achieved a generation ago.;Today we seek to move beyond the accomplishments of the past--to establish the principle that all the people of this Hemisphere are entitled to a decent way of life-- and to transform that principle into the reality of economic advance and social justice on which political equality must be based.;This is the most demanding goal of all. For we seek not merely the welfare and equality of nations one with another--but the welfare and the equality of the people within our nations. In so doing we are fulfilling the most ancient dreams of the founders of this Hemisphere, Washington, Jefferson, Bolivar, Marti, San Martin, and all the rest.;And I believe that the first seven months of this Alliance have strengthened our confidence that this goal is within our grasp.;Perhaps our most impressive accomplishment in working together has been the dramatic shift in the thinking and the attitudes which has occurred in our Hemisphere in these seven months. The Charter of Punta del Este posed the challenge of development in a manner that could not be ignored. It redefined the historic relationships between the American nations in terms of the fundamental needs and hopes of the twentieth century. It set forth the conditions and the attitudes on which development depends. It initiated the process of education without which development is impossible. It laid down a new principle of our relationship--the principle of collective responsibility for the welfare of the people of the Americas.;Already elections are being fought in terms of the Alliance for Progress. Already governments are pledging themselves to carry out the Charter of Punta del Este. Already people throughout the Hemisphere--in schools and in trade unions, in chambers of commerce, in military establishments, in government, on the farms-have accepted the goals of the Charter as their own personal and political commitments.;For the first time in the history of Inter-American relations our energies are concentrated on the central task of democratic development.;This dramatic change in thought is essential to the realization of our goals. For only by placing the task of development in the arena of daily thought and action among all the people can we hope to summon up the will and the courage which that task demands. This first accomplishment, therefore, is essential to all the others.;Our second achievement has been the establishment of the institutional framework within which our decade of development will take place. We honor here today the OAS Panel of Experts--a new adventure in Inter-American cooperation--drawn from all parts of the continent--charged with the high responsibility--almost unprecedented in any international cooperative effort--of evaluating long-range development plans, reviewing the progress of these plans, and helping to obtain the financing necessary to carry them out. This group has already begun its work. And here, today, I reaffirm our government's commitment to look to this Panel for advice and guidance in the conduct of our joint effort.;In addition, the OAS, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Inter-American Bank have offered planning assistance to Latin American nations--the OAS has begun a series of studies in critical development fields--and a new ECLA Planning Institute is being established to train the young men who will lead the future development of their countries. And we have completely reorganized in our own country our assistance program, with central responsibility now placed in the hands of a single coordinator.;Thus, within seven months, we have built the essential structure of the institutions, thought and policy on which our long-term effort will rest. But we have not waited for this structure to be completed in order to begin our work.;Last year I said that the United States would commit one billion dollars to the first year of that Alliance. That pledge has now been fulfilled. The Alliance for Progress has already meant better food for the children of Puno in Peru, new schools for people in Colombia, new homes for campesinos in Venezuela--which I saw myself during my recent visit. And in the year to come millions more will take new hope from the Alliance for Progress as it touches their daily life--as it must.;In the vital field of commodity stabilization I pledged the efforts of this country to try to work with you to end the frequent, violent price changes which damage the economies of so many Latin American countries. Immediately after that pledge was made, we began work on the task of formulating stabilization agreements. In December 1961 a new coffee agreement, drafted by a committee under a United States chairman, was completed. Today that agreement is in process of negotiation. I can think of no single measure which can make a greater contribution to the cause of development than effective stabilization of the price of coffee. In addition the United States has participated in the drafting of a cocoa agreement, and we have held discussion about the terms of possible accession to the tin agreement.;We have also been working with our. European allies--and I regard this as most important--in a determined effort to ensure that Latin American products will have equal access to the Common Market. Much of the economic future of this Hemisphere depends upon ready availability of the markets of the Atlantic Community, and we will continue these efforts to keep these markets open in the months ahead.;The countries of Latin America have also been working to fulfill the commitments of the Charter. The report of the Inter-American Bank contains an impressive list of measures being taken in each of the eighteen countries--measures ranging from the mobilization of domestic resources to new education and housing programs--measures within the context of the Act of Bogota, passed under the administration of my predecessor, President Eisenhower, and the Alliance for Progress Charter.;Nearly all the governments of the Hemisphere have begun to organize national development programs--and in some cases completed plans have been presented for review. Tax and land reform laws are on the books, and the national legislature of nearly every country is considering new measures in these critical fields. New programs of development, of housing, of agriculture and power are underway.;These are all heartening accomplishments-the fruits of the first seven months of work in a program which is designed to span a decade. But all who know the magnitude and urgency of the problems realize that we have just begun--that we must act much more rapidly and on a much larger scale if we are to meet our development goals in the months and years to come.;I pledge this country's effort to such an intensified effort. And I am confident that having emerged from the shaping period of our Alliance, all the nations of this Hemisphere will accelerate their own work.;For we all know that no matter what contribution the United States may make, the ultimate responsibility for success lies within the developing nation itself. For only you can mobilize the resources, make the reforms, set the goals and provide the energies which will transform our external assistance into an effective contribution to the progress of our continent. Only you can create the economic confidence which will encourage the free flow of capital, both domestic and foreign--the capital which, under conditions of responsible investment and together with public funds, will produce permanent economic advance. Only you can eliminate the evils of destructive inflation, chronic trade imbalances and widespread unemployment. Without determined efforts on your part to establish these conditions for reform and development, no amount of outside help can do the job.;I know the difficulties of such a task. It is unprecedented. Our own history shows how fierce the resistance can be to changes which later generations regard as part of the normal framework of life. And the course of rational social change is even more hazardous for those progressive governments who often face entrenched privilege of the right and subversive conspiracies on the left.;For too long my country, the wealthiest nation in a continent which is not wealthy, failed to carry out its full responsibilities to its sister Republics. We have now accepted that responsibility. In the same way those who possess wealth and power in poor nations must accept their own responsibilities. They must lead the fight for those basic reforms which alone can preserve the fabric of their societies. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.;These social reforms are at the heart of the Alliance for Progress. They are the precondition to economic modernization. And they are the instrument by which we assure the.poor and hungry--the worker and the campesino--his full participation in the benefits of our development and in the human dignity which is the purpose of all free societies. At the same time we sympathize with the difficulties of remaking deeply rooted and traditional social structures. We ask that substantial and steady progress toward reform accompany the effort to develop the economies of the American nations.;A year ago I also expressed our special friendship to the people of Cuba and the Dominican Republic and the hope that they would soon rejoin the society of free men, uniting with us in this common effort. Today I am glad to welcome among us the representatives of a free Dominican Republic, and to reaffirm the hope that, in the not too distant future, our society of free nations will once again be complete.;But we must not forget that our Alliance for Progress is more than a doctrine of development--a blueprint of economic advance. Rather it is an expression of the noblest goals of our society. It says that want and despair need not be the lot of free men. And those who may occasionally get discouraged with the magnitude of the task, have only to look to Europe fifteen years ago, and today, and realize the great potential which is in every free society when the people join and work together. It says in our Hemisphere that no society is free until all its people have an equal opportunity to share the fruits of their own land and their own labor. And it says that material progress is meaningless without individual freedom and political liberty. It is a doctrine of the freedom of man in the most spacious sense of that freedom.;Nearly a century ago Jose Hernandez, the Argentine poet, wrote, "America has a great destiny to achieve in the fate of mankind... One day... the American Alliance will undoubtedly be achieved, and the American Alliance will bring world peace... America must be the cradle of the great principles which are to bring a complete change in the political and social organization of other nations.;We have made a good start on our journey, but we have still a long way to go. The conquest of poverty is as difficult if not more difficult than the conquest of outer space. And we can expect moments of frustration and disappointment in the months and years to come. But we have no doubt about the outcome. For all history shows that the effort to win progress within freedom represents the most determined and steadfast aspiration of man.;We are joined together in this Alliance as nations united by a common history and common values. And I look forward--as do all the people of this country--to the day when the people of Latin America will take their rightful place beside the United States and Western Europe as citizens of industrialized and growing and increasingly abundant societies. The United States-Europe--and Latin America--almost a billion people--a bulwark of freedom and the values of Western civilization--invulnerable to the forces of despotism--lighting the path to liberty for all the peoples of the world. This is our vision--and, with faith and courage, we will realize that vision in our own time.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Remarks to a Group of Newly Promoted Foreign Service Officers.</td><td class="c6">March 6, 1963</td><td class="c7">Mr. Secretary, distinguished Members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen;I want to express my appreciation to all of you for your service to the United States. I recognize that there is frequently a feeling in the State Department that the White House interferes in foreign policy and we are attempting to control that!;But I want you to realize, as I am sure you do, that the intimate relationship between the office of the Presidency and the State Department is really second to none, under the Constitution, given the responsibilities which both of us carry. I feel that this is really the Golden Age of the State Department.;When you compare the responsibilities which you will bear to those of your predecessors back before World War I, in the days between World War I and World War II when American ambassadors were accredited mostly to Europe, most of the rest of the world was controlled by great empires centered in Europe. Now, however, ambassadors, consuls, scattered all around the globe where the United States has intimate relations and interests, bear tremendous responsibilities.;Upon their judgment, in many cases of crisis, will the future independence of that country rest and the security of the United States. I can think of a good' many cases in the 2 years that I have been here, the work of our embassy in Laos during some very crucial negotiations some months ago, the work of our consul in Elizabethville during the last year, the work of our consul in the Dominican Republic during the crucial days that occupied their attention a year ago.;I could really go through country after country where a member of the Foreign Service played a very vital role, where we were wholly dependent in Washington upon their good judgment, in fact, your good judgment. So I do think that you should take the greatest satisfaction in your work. We are involved in the most extraordinary enterprise attempting to assist countries to maintain their independence scattered all around the globe.;For a country with a long isolationist tradition to move out and be as heavily committed as we are puts extraordinary responsibilities upon the point of the sphere which is the Foreign Service. So we want to express our thanks to you. In spite of what you read, we love the State Department.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Free World Defense and Assistance Programs.</td><td class="c6">April 2, 1963</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war", wrote Milton. And no peacetime victory in history has been as far-reaching in its impact, nor served the cause of freedom so well, as the victories scored in the last 17 years by this Nation's mutual defense and assistance programs. These victories have been, in the main, quiet instead of dramatic. Their aim has been, not to gain territories for the United States or support in the United Nations, but to preserve freedom and hope, and to prevent tyranny and subversion, in dozens of key nations all over the world.;The United States today is spending over 10% of its Gross National Product on programs primarily aimed at improving our national security. Somewhat less than l/12 of this amount, and less than 0.7% of our GNP, goes into the mutual assistance program: roughly half for economic development, and half for military and other short-term assistance. The contribution of this program to our national interest clearly outweighs its cost. The richest nation in the world would surely be justified in spending less than 1% of its national income on assistance to its less fortunate sister nations solely as a matter of international responsibility, but inasmuch as these programs are not merely the right thing to do, but clearly in our national self-interest, all criticisms should be placed in that perspective. That our aid programs can be improved is not a matter of debate. But that our aid programs serve both our national traditions and our national interest is beyond all reasonable doubt.;History records that our aid programs to Turkey and Greece were the crucial element that enabled Turkey to stand up against heavy-handed Soviet pressures, Greece to put down communist aggression and both to recreate stable societies and to move forward in the direction of economic and social growth.;History records that the Marshall Plan made it possible for the nations of Western Europe, including the United Kingdom, to recover from the devastation of the world's most destructive war, to rebuild military strength, to withstand the expansionist thrust of Stalinist Russia, and to embark on an economic renaissance which has made Western Europe the second greatest and richest industrial complex in the world today--a vital center of free world strength, itself now contributing to the growth and strength of less developed countries.;History records that our military and economic assistance to nations on the frontiers of the communist world--such as Iran, Pakistan, India, Vietnam and free China has enabled threatened peoples to stay free and independent, when they otherwise would have either been overrun by aggressive communist power or fallen victim of utter chaos, poverty and despair.;History records that our contributions to international aid have been the critical factor in the growth of a whole family of international financial institutions and agencies, playing an ever more important role in the ceaseless war against want and the struggle for growth and freedom.;And, finally, history will record that today our technical assistance and development loans are giving hope where hope was lacking, sparking action where life was static, and stimulating progress around the earth" simultaneously supporting the military security of the free world, helping to erect bartiers against the growth of communism where those barriers count the most, helping to build the kind of world community of independent, self-supporting nations in which we want to live, and helping to serve the deep American urge to extend a generous hand to those working toward a better life for themselves and their children.;Despite noisy opposition from the very first days--despite dire predictions that foreign aid would "bankrupt" the Republic-despite warnings that the Marshall Plan and successor programs were "throwing our money down a rat-hole"--despite great practical difficulties and some mistakes and disappointments--the fact is that our aid programs generally and consistently have done what they were expected to do.;Freedom is not on the run anywhere in the world--not in Europe, Asia, Africa, or Latin America--as it might well have been without U.S. aid. And we now know that freedom--all freedom, including our own-is diminished when other countries fall under Communist domination, as in China in 1949, North Vietnam and the northern provinces of Laos in 1954, and Cuba in 1959. Freedom, all freedom, is threatened by the subtle, varied and unceasing Communist efforts at subversion in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. And the prospect for freedom is also endangered or eroded in countries which see no hope--no hope for a better life based on economic progress, education, social justice and the development of stable institutions. These are the frontiers of freedom which our military and economic aid programs seek to advance, and in so doing, they serve our deepest national interest.;This view has been held by three successive Presidents--Democratic and Republican alike.;It has been endorsed by a bi-partisan majority of nine successive Congresses.;It has been supported for seventeen years by a bi-partisan majority of the American people.;And it has only recently been reconfirmed by a distinguished committee of private citizens, headed by General Lucius Clay and including Messrs. Robert Anderson, Eugene Black, Clifford Hardin, Robert Lovett, Edward Mason, L. F. McCollum, George Meany, Herman Phleger and Howard Rusk. Their report stated: "We believe these programs, properly conceived and implemented, to be essential to the security of our nation and necessary to the exercise of its worldwide responsibilities.;There is, in short, a national consensus of many years standing on the vital importance of these programs. The principle and purpose of United States assistance to less secure and less fortunate nations are not and cannot be seriously in doubt.;II. PRESENT NEEDS;The question now is: what about the future? In the perspective of these past gains, what is the dimension of present needs, what are our opportunities, and what changes do we face at this juncture in world history?;I believe it is a crucial juncture. Our world is near the climax of an historic convulsion. A tidal wave of national independence has nearly finished its sweep through lands which contain one out of every three people in the world. The industrial and scientific revolution is spreading to the far corners of the earth. And two irreconcilable views of the value, the rights and the role of the individual human being confront the peoples of the world.;In some eighty developing nations, countless large and small decisions will be made in the days and months and years ahead-decisions which, taken together, will establish the economic and social system, determine the political leadership, shape the political practices, and mold the structure of the institutions which will promote either consent or coercion for one-third of humanity. And these decisions will drastically affect the shape of the world in which our children grow to maturity.;Africa is stirring restlessly to consolidate its independence and to make that independence meaningful for its people through economic and social development. The people of America have affirmed and reaffirmed their sympathy with these objectives.;Free Asia is responding resolutely to the political, economic and military challenge of Communist China's relentless efforts to dominate the continent.;Latin America is striving to take decisive steps toward effective democracy--amid the turbulence of rapid social change and the menace of communist subversion.;The United States--the richest and most powerful of all peoples, a nation committed to the independence of nations and to a better life for all peoples--can no more stand aside in this climactic age of decision than we can withdraw from the community of free nations. Our effort is not merely symbolic. It is addressed to our vital security interests.;It is in this context that I hope the American people through their representatives in Congress will consider our request this year for foreign aid funds designed carefully and explicitly to meet these specific challenges. This is not a wearisome burden. It is a new chapter in our involvement in a continuously vital struggle--the most challenging and constructive effort ever undertaken by man on behalf of freedom and his fellow man.;III. OBJECTIVES FOR IMPROVEMENT;In a changing world, our programs of mutual defense and assistance must be kept under constant review. My recommendations herein reflect the work of the Clay Committee., the scrutiny undertaken by the new Administrator of the Agency for International Development, and the experience gained in our first full year of administering the new and improved program enacted by the Congress in 1961. There is fundamental agreement throughout these reviews: that these assistance programs are of great value to our deepest national interest--that their basic concepts and organization, as embodied in the existing legislation, are properly conceived-that progress has been made and is being made in translating these concepts into action--but that much still remains to be done to improve our performance and make the best possible use of these programs.;In addition, there is fundamental agreement in all these reviews regarding six key recommendations for the future.;Objective No. 1: To apply stricter standards of selectivity and self-help in aiding developing countries. This objective was given special attention by the Committee to Strengthen the Security of the Free World, (The Clay Report), which estimated that the application of such criteria could result in substantial savings in selected programs over the next one to three years.;Considerable progress has already been made along these lines. While the number of former colonies achieving independence has lengthened the total list of countries receiving assistance, 80% of all economic assistance now goes to only 20 countries, and military assistance is even more narrowly concentrated. The proportion of development loans, as contrasted with outright grants, has increased from 10% to 60%. We have placed all our development lending on a dollar repayable basis, and this year we are increasing our efforts, as the Clay Committee recommended, to tailor our loan terms so that interest rates and maturities will reflect to a greater extent the differences in the ability of different countries to service debt.;In the Alliance for Progress in particular, and increasingly in other aid programs, emphasis is placed upon self-help and self-reform by the recipients themselves, using our aid as a catalyst for progress and not as a handout. Finally, in addition to emphasizing primarily economic rather than military assistance, wherever conditions permit, we are taking a sharp new look at both the size and purpose of those local military forces which receive our assistance. Our increased stress on internal security and civic action in military assistance is in keeping with our experience that in developing countries, military forces can have an important economic as well as protective role to play. For example, in Latin America, in fiscal year 1963, military assistance funds allocated for the support of engineer, medical and other civic action type units more than doubled.;Objective No. 2: To achieve a reduction and ultimate elimination of U.S. assistance by enabling nations to stand on their own as rapidly as possible. Both this nation and the countries we help have a stake in their reaching the point of self-sustaining growth the point where they no longer require external aid to maintain their independence. Our goal is not an arbitrary cutoff date but the earliest possible "take off" date--the date when their economies will have been launched with sufficient momentum to enable them to become self-supporting, requiring only the same normal sources of external financing to meet expanding capital needs that this country required for many decades.;For some, this goal is near at hand, insofar as economic assistance is concerned. For others, more time will be needed. But in all cases, specific programs leading to self-support should be set and priorities established-including those steps which must be taken by the recipient countries and all others who are willing to help them.;The record dearly shows that foreign aid is not an endless or unchanging process. Fifteen years ago our assistance went almost entirely to the advanced countries of Europe and Japan--today it is directed almost entirely to the developing world. Ten years ago most of our assistance was given to shoring up military forces and unstable economies today this kind of aid has been cut in half, and our assistance goes increasingly toward economic development. There are still, however, important cases where there has been no diminution in the Communist military threat, and both military and economic aid are still required. Such cases range from relatively stabilized frontiers, as in Korea and Turkey, to areas of active aggression, such as Vietnam.;Objective No. 3: To secure the increased participation of other industrialized nations in sharing the cost of international development assistance. The United States is no longer alone in aiding the developing countries, and its proportionate share of the burden is diminishing. The flow of funds from other industrialized countries--now totaling on the order of $2 billion a year--is expected to continue, and we expect to work more closely with these other countries in order to make the most effective use of our joint efforts. In addition, the international lending and technical assistance agencies--to which we contribute heavily--have expanded the schedule and scope of their operations, and we look forward to supplementing those resources selectively in conjunction with increased contributions from other nations. We will continue to work with our allies, urging them to increase their assistance efforts and to extend assistance on terms less burdensome to the developing countries.;Objective No. 4: To lighten any adverse impact of the aid program on our own balance of payments and economy. A few years ago, more than half of U.S. economic aid funds were spent abroad, contributing to the drain on our dollars and gold. Of our current commitments, over eighty percent will be spent in the United States, contributing to the growth of our economy and employment opportunities. This proportion is rising as further measures are being taken to this end. I might add that our balance of payments position today is being significantly helped by the repayment of loans made to European countries under the Marshall Plan and by the Export-Import Bank. I am confident that in the future, as income in the less developed countries rises, we will similarly benefit from the loans we are now making to them.;Our economy is also being helped by the expansion of commercial exports to countries whose present growth and prosperity were spurred by U.S. economic assistance in earlier years. Over the last decade, our exports to Western Europe and the United Kingdom have more than doubled, and our exports to Japan have increased four-fold. Similarly, we can look forward to a future widening of trade opportunities in those countries whose economic development we are currently assisting.;In addition, our Food for Peace Program is increasingly using our agricultural commodities to stimulate the economic growth of developing nations and to assist in achieving other U.S. foreign policy goals. As the economies of developing nations improve, we are encouraging them to shift from foreign currency to cash sales or to dollar credit sales for these commodities.;The relative burden of our assistance programs has been steadily reduced--from some two percent of our national product at the beginning of the Marshall Plan to seven-tenths of one percent today--from 11.5 percent of the Federal Budget in 1949 to 4 percent today.;Although these figures indicate that our aid programs cost, in relative terms, considerably less today then they did ten or fifteen years ago, we are continuing our efforts to improve the effectiveness of these programs and increase the return on every dollar invested. Personnel, procedures, and administration are being improved. A number of field missions have been closed, scaled down or merged into embassies or regional offices. These efforts toward greater efficiency and economy are being accelerated under the new Administrator.;Objective No. 5: To continue to assist in the defense of countries under threat of external and internal Communist attack. Our military assistance program has been an essential element in keeping the boundary of Soviet and Chinese military power relatively stable for over a decade. Without its protection the substantial economic progress made by underdeveloped countries along the Sino-Soviet periphery would hardly have been possible. As these countries build economic strength, they will be able to assume more of the burden of their defense. But we must not assume that military assistance to these countries--or to others primarily exposed to subversive internal attack--can be ended in the foreseeable future. On the contrary, while it will be possible to reduce and terminate some programs, we should anticipate the need for new and expanded programs.;India is a case in point. The wisdom of earlier U.S. aid in helping the Indian subcontinent's considerable and fruitful efforts toward progress and stability can hardly now be in question. The threat made plain by the Chinese attack on India last Fall may require additional efforts on our part to help bolster the security of this crucial area, assuming these efforts can be matched in an appropriate way by the efforts of India and Pakistan.;But overall, the magnitude of military assistance is small in relation to our national security expenditures, in this fiscal year it amounts to about 3% of our defense budget. "Dollar for dollar," said the Clay Committee with particular reference to the border areas, "these programs contribute more to the security of the free world than corresponding expenditures in our defense appropriations... These countries are providing more than two million armed men ready, for the most part, for any emergency." Clearly, if this program did not exist, our defense budget would undoubtedly have to be increased substantially to provide an equivalent contribution to the Free World's defense.;Objective No. 6: To increase the role of private investment and other non-Federal resources in assisting developing nations. In recent months, important new steps have been taken to mobilize on behalf of this program the competence of a variety of nongovernmental organizations and individuals in this country. Cooperatives and savings and loan associations have been very active in establishing similar institutions abroad, particularly in Latin America. Our land grant and other universities are establishing better working relationships with our programs to assist overseas rural development. Already there are thirty-seven U.S. universities and land grant institutions at work in Latin America, for example, with a substantial increase expected during the coming year. Public and private leaders from the State of California are exploring with their counterparts in Chile how the talents and resources of a particular state can be more directly channeled toward assisting a particular country. Labor unions, foundations, trade associations, professional societies and many others likewise possess skills and resources which we are drawing upon increasingly-in order to engage in a more systematic and meaningful way, in this vital nation-building process, the whole complex of private and public institutions upon which our own national life depends. For at the heart of the modernization process lies the central problem of creating, adapting and improving the institutions which any modern society will need.;IV. PRIVATE INVESTMENT;The primary new initiative in this year's program relates to our increased efforts to encourage the investment of private capital in the under-developed countries. Already considerable progress has been made fostering U.S. private investment through the use of investment guaranties--with over $900 million now outstanding--and by means of cost-sharing on investment surveys, loans of local currencies, and other measures provided under existing law. During the first half of this fiscal year alone, $7.7 million in local currencies have been loaned to private business firms.;I believe much more should be done, however, both administratively through more vigorous action by the Agency for International Development, and legislatively by the Congress. Administratively, our Ambassadors and Missions abroad, in their negotiations with the less developed countries, are being directed to urge more forcefully the importance of making full use of private resources and improving the climate for private investment, both domestic and foreign. In particular, I am concerned that the investment guaranty program is not fully operative in some countries because of the failure of their governments to execute the normal inter-governmental agreements relating to investment guaranties.;In addition, the Agency for International Development will also strengthen and enlarge its own activities relating to private enterprise-both its efforts to assist in the development of vigorous private economies in the developing countries, and its facilities for mobilizing and assisting the capital and skills of private business in contributing to economic development.;Legislatively, I am recommending the following;(a) An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code for a trial period to grant U.S. taxpayers a tax credit for new investments in developing countries, which should also apply to some extent to reinvestments of their earnings in those countries. Such a credit, by making possible an increased rate of return, should substantially encourage additional private investment in the developing countries. The U.S. businessmen's committee for the Alliance for Progress has recommended the adoption of such a measure.;(b) Amendments in the investment guaranty provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act designed to enlarge and clarify the guaranty program.;Economic and social growth cannot be accomplished by governments alone. The effective participation of an enlightened United States businessman, especially in partnership with private interests in the developing country, brings not only his investment but his technological and management skills into the process of development. His successful participation in turn helps create that climate of confidence which is so critical in attracting and holding vital external and internal capital. We welcome and encourage initiatives being taken in the private sector in Latin America to accelerate industrial growth and hope that similar cooperative efforts will be established with other developing countries.;V. THE ALLIANCE FOR PROGRESS;In a special sense, the achievements of the Alliance for Progress in the coming years will be the measure of our determination, our ideals, and our wisdom. Here in this hemisphere, in this last year, our resourcefulness as a people was challenged in the clearest terms. We moved at once to resist the threat of aggressive nuclear weapons in Cuba, and we found the nations of Latin America at our side. They, like ourselves, were brought to a new awareness of the danger of permitting the poverty and despair of a whole people to continue long anywhere in this continent.;Had the needs of the people of Cuba been met in the pre-Castro period--their need for food, for housing, for education, for jobs, above all, for a democratic responsibility in the fulfillment of their own hopes--there would have been no Castro, no missiles in Cuba, and no need for Cuba's neighbors to incur the immense risks of resistance to threatened aggression from that island.;There is but one way to avoid being faced with similar dilemmas in the future. It is to bring about in all the countries of Latin America the conditions of hope, in which the peoples of this continent will know that they can shape a better future for themselves, not through obeying the inhumane commands of an alien and cynical ideology, but through personal self-expression, individual judgment, and the acts of responsible citizenship.;As Americans, we have long recognized the legitimacy of these aspirations, in recent months we have been able to see, as never before, their urgency and, I believe, the concrete means for their realization.;In less than two years, the 10 year program of the Alliance for Progress has become more than an idea and more than a commitment of governments. The necessary initial effort to develop plans, to organize institutions, to test and experiment has itself required and achieved a new dedication--a new dedication to intelligent compromise between old and new ways of life. In the long run, it is this effort and not the threat of Communism--that will determine the fate of freedom in the Western Hemisphere.;These years have not been easy ones for any group in Latin America. A similar change in the fundamental orientation of our own society would have been no easier. The difficulty of the changes to be brought about makes all the more heartening the success of many nations of Latin America in achieving reforms which will make their fundamental economic and social structures both more efficient and more equitable.;Some striking accomplishments, moreover, are already visible. New housing is being expanded in most countries of the region. Educational facilities are growing rapidly. Road construction, particularly in agricultural areas, is accelerating at a rapid pace. With U.S. funds, over two million text books are being distributed to combat the illiteracy of nearly half of the 210 million people of Latin America. In the countries of the Alliance for Progress, the diets of eight million children and mothers are being supplemented with United States Food for Peace, and this figure should reach nearly 16 million by next year.;In trouble-ridden Northeast Brazil, under an agreement with the State of Rio Grande do Norte, a program is underway to train three thousand teachers, build one thousand classrooms, ten vocational schools, eight normal schools, and four teacher training centers. A $30 million slum clearance project is underway in Venezuela. In Bogota, Colombia, the site of the old airport is becoming a new city for 71 thousand persons who are building their own homes with support from the Social Progress Trust Fund.;This year I received a letter from Senor Argemil Plazas Garcia, whom I met in Bogota upon the dedication of an Alianza housing project. He writes: "Today I am living in the house with my thirteen children, and we are very happy to be free of such poverty and no longer to be moving around like outcasts. Now we have dignity and freedom... My wife, my children and I are writing you this humble letter, to express to you the warm gratitude of such Colombian friends who now have a home in which they can live happily." Of even greater long-range importance, a number of beginnings in self-help and reforms are now evident.;Since 1961, eleven Latin American countries-Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela-have made structural reforms in their tax systems. Twelve countries have improved their income tax laws and administration.;New large scale programs for improved land use and land reform have been undertaken in Venezuela, the Dominican Republic and two states in Brazil. More limited plans are being carried out in Chile, Colombia, Panama, Uruguay and Central America.;Six Latin American countries--Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico, and Venezuela-have submitted development programs to the panel of experts of the Organization of American States. The panel has evaluated and reported on the first three and will soon offer its views on the balance.;Viewed against the background of decades of neglect--or, at most, intermittent bursts of attention to basic problems--the start that has been made is encouraging. Perhaps most significant of all is a change in the hearts and minds of the people--a growing will to develop their countries. We can only help Latin Americans to save themselves. It is for this reason that the increasing determination of the peoples of the region to build modern societies is heartening. And it is for this reason that responsible leadership in Latin America must respond to this popular will with a greater sense of urgency and purpose, lest aspirations turn into frustrations and hope turn into despair. Pending reform legislation must be enacted, statutes already on the books must be enforced, and mechanisms for carrying out programs must be organized and invigorated. These steps are not easy, as we know from our own experience, but they must be taken.;Our own intention is to concentrate our support in Latin America on those countries adhering to the principles established in the Charter of Punta del Este, and to work with our neighbors to indicate more precisely the particular policy changes, reforms and other self-help measures which are necessary to make our assistance effective and the Alliance a success. The Clay Committee recommendation that we continue to expand our efforts to encourage economic integration within the region and the expansion of trade among the countries of Latin America has great merit. The determination of the Central American Presidents to move boldly in this direction impressed me greatly during my recent meeting with them in San Jose, Costa Rica, and the Agency for International Development has already established a regional office in Central America, is giving support to a regional development bank and has participated in regional trade conferences.;A beginning has been made in the first two years of the Alliance, but the job that is still ahead must be tackled with continuing urgency. Many of the ingredients for a successful decade are at hand, and the fundamental course for the future is clear. It remains for all parties to the Alliance to provide the continuous will and effort needed to move steadily along that course.;VI. THIS YEARNS AUTHORIZING LEGISLATION;Translating the foregoing facts and principles into program costs and appropriations, based on the application of the standards set forth above and affirmed by the Clay Committee, yields the following results;First, upwards of $200 million of economic assistance funds now available are expected to be saved and not used in the present fiscal year, and upwards of $100 million of these unused funds will remain available for lending in the future;Second, in addition to the savings carried forward into next year, close review has indicated a number of reductions that can be made in the original budget estimates for economic and military assistance without serious damage to the national interest.;Together these factors permit a reduction in the original Budget estimates from $4.9 billion to $4.5 billion. This amount reflects anticipated reductions in military and economic assistance to a number of countries, in line with these standards and recommendations, and unavoidable increases to others. The principal net increases proposed in 1964 appropriations are the following;--an additional $325 million for lending in Latin America--$125 million through the Agency for International Development and $200 million through the Social Progress Trust Fund, administered for the United States by the Inter-American Development Bank (for which no appropriation was needed in fiscal year 1963 because a two-year appropriation had been made the year before);--an additional $85 million for lending elsewhere in the world, mostly in countries such as India, Pakistan, and Nigeria which are meeting those high standards of self-help and fiscal and economic progress which permit our aid to be directed toward ultimate full self-support;--an additional $80 million for military aid, including the increased requirements for India (but still far below the fiscal 1961 level), and;--an additional $50 million for the contingency fund, which provides a flexibility indispensable to our security. We cannot ignore the possibility that new threats similar to those in Laos or Vietnam might arise in areas which now look calm, or that new opportunities will open up to achieve major gains in the cause of freedom. Foreign aid policy can no more be static than foreign policy itself.;I believe that it is necessary and desirable that these funds be provided by the Congress to meet program needs and to be available for program opportunities. Funds which are not required under the increasingly selective program and performance standards of our assistance programs will, as in this year, not be spent or committed.;The legislative amendments which I am forwarding herewith carry forward the basic structure and intent of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended. No fundamental changes in this legislative structure now appear to be required.;One relatively minor change I am proposing is for a separate authorization for the appropriation of funds to assist American schools and hospitals abroad. A number of these schools sponsored by Americans have been most successful in the developing countries in providing an education built upon American standards. Until now some assistance has been made available to these schools from general economic aid funds, but this is becoming increasingly inappropriate. Separate authorization and appropriations would be used to help these schools carry out long-term programs to establish themselves on a sounder financial footing, becoming gradually independent, if at all possible, of U.S. Government support.;Finally, I am requesting the Congress in this legislation to amend that section of the Trade Expansion Act which requires the denial of equal tariff treatment to imports from Poland and Yugoslavia. It is appropriate that this amendment should be incorporated in this Bill since it is my conviction that trade and other forms of normal relations constitute a sounder basis than aid for our future relationship with these countries.;VII. CONCLUSION;In closing, let me again emphasize the overriding importance of the efforts in which we are engaged.;At this point in history we can look back to many successes in the struggle to preserve freedom. Our nation is still daily winning unseen victories in the fight against communist subversion in the slums and hamlets, in the hospitals and schools, and in the offices of governments across a world bent on lifting itself. Two centuries of pioneering and growth must be telescoped into decades and even years. This is a field of action for which our history has prepared us, to which our aspirations have drawn us, and into which our national interest moves us.;Around the world cracks in the monolithic apparatus of our adversary are there for all to see. This, for the American people, is a time for vision, for patience, for work and for wisdom. For better or worse, we are the pacesetters. Freedom's leader cannot flag or falter, or another runner will set the pace.;We have dared to label the Sixties the Decade of Development. But it is not the eloquence of our slogans, but the quality of our endurance, which will determine whether this generation of Americans deserves the leadership which history has thrust upon us.;JOHN F.

Kennedy: Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on Revision of the Immigration Laws.</td><td class="c6">July 23, 1963</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr.;I am transmitting herewith, for the consideration of the Congress, legislation revising and modernizing our immigration laws. More than a decade has elapsed since the last substantial amendment to these laws. I believe there exists a compelling need for the Congress to re-examine and make certain changes in these laws.;The most urgent and fundamental reform I am recommending relates to the national origins system of selecting immigrants. Since 1924 it has been used to determine the number of quota immigrants permitted to enter the United States each year. Accordingly, although the legislation I am transmitting deals with many problems which require remedial action, it concentrates attention primarily upon revision of our quota immigration system. The enactment of this legislation will not resolve all of our important problems in the field of immigration law. It will, however, provide a sound basis upon which we can build in developing an immigration law that serves the national interest and reflects in every detail the principles of equality and human dignity to which our nation subscribes.;Elimination of Discrimination Based on National Origins;Present legislation establishes a system of annual quotas to govern immigration from each country. Under this system, 156,700 quota immigrants are permitted to enter the United States each year. The system is based upon the national origins of the population of the United States in 1920. The use of the year 1920 is arbitrary. It rests upon the fact that this system was introduced in 1924 and the last prior census was in 1920. The use of a national origins system is without basis in either logic or reason. It neither satisfies a national need nor accomplishes an international purpose. In an age of interdependence among nations, such a system is an anachronism, for it discriminates among applicants for admission into the United States on the basis of accident of birth.;Because of the composition of our population in 1920, the system is heavily weighted in favor of immigration from northern Europe and severely limits immigration from southern and eastern Europe and from other parts of the world. An American citizen with a Greek father or mother must wait at least 18 months to bring his parents here to join him. A citizen whose married son or daughter, or brother or sister, is Italian cannot obtain a quota number for them for an even longer time. Meanwhile, many thousands of quota numbers are wasted because they are not wanted or needed by nationals of the countries to which they are assigned.;I recommend that there be substituted for the national origins system a formula governing immigration to the United States which takes into account (1) the skills of the immigrant and their relationship to our needs, (a) the family relationship between immigrants and persons already here, so that the reuniting of families is encouraged, and (3) the priority of registration. Present law grants a preference to immigrants with special skills, education or training. It also grants a preference to various relatives of United States citizens and lawfully resident aliens. But it does so only within a national origins quota. It should be modified so that those with the greatest ability to add to the national welfare, no matter where they were born, are granted the highest priority. The next priority should go to those who seek to be reunited with their relatives. As between applicants with equal claims the earliest registrant should be the first admitted.;Many problems of fairness and foreign policy are involved in replacing a system so long entrenched. The national origins system has produced large backlogs of applications in some countries, and too rapid a change might, in a system of limited immigration, so drastically curtail immigration in some countries the only effect might be to shift the unfairness from one group of nations to another. A reasonable time to adjust to any new system must be provided if individual hardships upon persons who were relying on the present system are to be avoided. In addition, any new system must have sufficient flexibility to allow adjustments to be made when it appears that immigrants from nations closely allied to the United States will be unduly restricted in their freedom to furnish the new seed population that has so long been a source of strength to our nation.;Accordingly, I recommend;First, that existing quotas be reduced gradually, at the rate of 20 percent a year. The quota numbers released each year would be placed in a quota reserve pool, to be distributed on the new basis.;Second, that natives of no one country receive over 10 percent of the total quota numbers authorized in any one year. This will insure that the pattern of immigration is not distorted by excessive demand from any one country.;Third, that the President be authorized, after receiving recommendations from a 7-man Immigration Board, to reserve up to 50 percent of the unallocated quota numbers, for issuance to persons disadvantaged by the change in the quota system, and up to 20 percent to refugees whose sudden dislocation requires special treatment. The Immigration Board will be composed of 2 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 2 members appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and 3 members appointed by the President. In addition to its responsibility for formulating recommendations regarding the use of the quota reserve pool, the Board will make a continuous study of our immigration policy.;All Quota Numbers Used;But it is not alone the initial assignment of quota numbers which is arbitrary and unjust, additional inequity results from the failure of the law to permit full utilization of the authorized quota numbers. While American citizens wait for years for their relatives to receive a quota, approximately 60,000 quota numbers are wasted each year because the countries to which they are assigned have far more numbers allocated to them than they have emigrants seeking to move to the United States. There is no way at present in which these numbers can be reassigned to nations where immense backlogs of applicants for admission to the United States have accumulated. I recommend that this deficiency in the law be corrected.;Asia-Pacific Triangle;A special discriminatory formula is now used to regulate the immigration of persons who are attributable by their ancestry to an area called the Asia-Pacific triangle. This area embraces all countries from Pakistan to Japan and the Pacific islands north of Australia and New Zealand. Usually, the quota under which a prospective immigrant must enter is determined by his place of birth. However, if as much as one-half of an immigrant's ancestors came from nations in the Asia-Pacific triangle, he must rely upon the small quota assigned to the country of his ancestry, regardless of where he was born. This provision of our law should be repealed.;Other Provisions;In order to remove other existing barriers to the reuniting of families, I recommend two additional improvements in the law.;First, parents of American citizens, who now have a preferred quota status, should be accorded nonquota status.;Second, parents of aliens resident in the United States, who now have no preference, should be accorded a preference, after skilled specialists and other relatives of citizens and alien residents.;These changes will have little effect on the number of immigrants admitted. They will have a major effect upon the individual hardships many of our citizens and residents now face in being separated from their parents.;In addition, I recommend the following changes in the law in order to correct certain deficiencies and improve its general application.;1. Changes in the Preference Structure. At present, the procedure under which specially skilled or trained workers are permitted to enter this country too often prevents talented people from applying for visas to enter the United States. It often deprives us of immigrants who would be helpful to our economy and our culture. This procedure should be liberalized so that highly trained or skilled persons may obtain a preference without requiring that they secure employment here before emigrating. In addition, I recommend that a special preference be accorded workers with lesser skills who can fill specific needs in short supply in this country.;2. Non-quota status for natives of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago should be granted. Under existing law, no numerical limitation is imposed upon the number of immigrants coming from Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the Canal Zone, or any independent country in Central or South America. But the language of the statute restricts this privilege to persons born in countries in the Caribbean area which gained their independence prior to the date of the last major amendment to the immigration and nationality statutes, in 1952. This accidental discrimination against the newly independent nations of the Western Hemisphere should be corrected.;3. Persons afflicted with mental health problems should be admitted provided certain standards are met. Today, any person afflicted with a mental disease or mental defect, psychotic personality, or epilepsy, and any person who has suffered an attack of mental illness, can enter this country only if a private bill is enacted for his benefit. Families which are able and willing to care for a mentally ill child or parent are often forced to choose between living in the United States and leaving their loved ones behind and not living in the United States but being able to see and care for their loved ones. Mental illness is not incurable. It should be treated like other illnesses. I recommend that the Attorney General, at his discretion and under proper safeguards, be authorized to waive those provisions of the law which prohibit the admission to the United States of persons with mental problems when they are close relatives of United States citizens and lawfully resident aliens.;4. The Secretary of State should be authorized, in his discretion, to require re-registration of certain quota immigrant visa applicants and to regulate the time of payment of visa fees. This authority would bring registration lists up to date, terminate the priority of applicants who have refused to accept a visa, and end the problem of "insurance" registrations by persons who have no present intention to emigrate. Registration figures for oversubscribed quota areas are now inaccurate because there exists no way of determining whether registrants have died, have emigrated to other countries, or for some other reason no longer want to emigrate to the United States. These problems are particularly acute in heavily oversubscribed areas.;Conclusion;As I have already indicated the measures I have outlined will not solve all the problems of immigration. Many of them will require additional legislation, some cannot be solved by any one country. But the legislation I am submitting will insure that progress will continue to be made toward our ideals and toward the realization of humanitarian objectives. The measures I have recommended will help eliminate discrimination between peoples and nations on a basis that is unrelated to any contribution that immigrants can make and is inconsistent with our traditions of welcome. Our investment in new citizens has always been a valuable source of our strength.;Sincerely;JOHN F. KENNEDY</td></tr>

Kennedy: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">October 9, 1963</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. [I.] I have a statement to make. The Soviet Union and various Eastern European countries have expressed a willingness to buy from our private grain dealers at the regular world price several million tons of surplus American wheat or wheat flour for shipment during the next several months. They may also wish to purchase from us surplus feed grains and other agricultural commodities.;After consultation with the National Security Council, and informing the appropriate leaders of the Congress, I have concluded that such sales by private dealers for American dollars or gold, either cash on delivery or normal commercial terms, should not be prohibited by the Government. The Commodity Credit Corporation in the Department of Agriculture will sell to our private grain traders the amount necessary to replace the grain used to fulfill these requirements, and the Department of Commerce will grant export licenses for their sale with the commitment that these commodities are for delivery to and use in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe only.;An added feature is the provision that the wheat we sell to the Soviet Union will be carried in available American ships, supplemented by ships of other countries as required. Arrangements will also be made by the Department of Commerce to prevent any single American dealer from receiving an excessive share of these sales.;No action by the Congress is required, but a special report on the matter will be sent to both Houses tomorrow.;Basically, the Soviet Union will be treated like any other cash customer in the world market who is willing and able to strike a bargain with private American merchants. While this wheat, like all wheat sold abroad, will be sold at the world price, which is the only way it can be sold, there is in such transactions no subsidy to the foreign purchaser, only a savings to the American taxpayer on wheat the Government has already purchased and stored at the higher domestic price which is maintained to assist our farmers.;This transaction has obvious benefit for the United States. The sale of 4 million metric tons of wheat, for example, for an estimated $250 million, and additional sums from the use of American shipping, will benefit our balance of payments and gold reserves by that amount and substantially strengthen the economic outlook for those employed in producing, transporting, handling, and loading farm products.;Wheat, moreover, is our number one farm surplus today, to the extent of about 1 billion unsold bushels. The sale of around 150 million bushels of wheat would be worth over $200 million to the American taxpayer in reduced budget expenditures. Our country has always responded to requests for food from governments of people who needed it, so long as we were certain that the people would actually get it and know where it came from.;The Russian people will know they are receiving American wheat. The United States has never had a policy against selling consumer goods, including agricultural commodities, to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. On the contrary, we have been doing exactly that for a number of years, and to the extent that their limited supplies of gold, dollars, and foreign exchange must be used for food, they cannot be used to purchase military or other equipment.;Our allies have long been engaged in extensive sales of wheat and other farm products to the Communist bloc, and, in fact, it would be foolish to halt the sales of our wheat when other countries can buy wheat from us today and then sell this flour to the Communists. In recent weeks Australia and NATO allies have agreed to sell 10 million to 15 million tons of wheat and wheat flour to the Communist bloc.;This transaction advertises to the world as nothing else could the success of free American agriculture. It demonstrates our willingness to relieve food shortages, to reduce tensions, and to improve relations with all countries. And it shows that peaceful agreements with the United States which serves the interests of both sides are a far more worthwhile course than a course of isolation and hostility.;For this Government to tell our grain traders that they cannot accept these offers, on the other hand, would accomplish little or nothing. The Soviets would continue to buy wheat and flour elsewhere, including wheat flour, from those nations which buy our wheat. Moreover, having for many years sold them farm products which are not in surplus, it would make no sense to refuse to sell those products on which we must otherwise pay the cost of storage. In short, this particular decision with respect to sales to the Soviet Union, which is not inconsistent with many smaller transactions over a long period of time, does not represent a new Soviet-American trade policy. That must await the settlement of many matters. But it does represent one more hopeful sign that a more peaceful world is both possible and beneficial to us all.;Q. Mr. President, do you have any misgivings about possible political repercussions from your decision?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I suppose there will be some who will disagree with this decision. That is true about most decisions. But I have considered it very carefully and I think it is very much in the interest of the United States. As I said before, we have got 1 billion bushels of this in surplus, and American taxpayers are paying to keep it, and I think we can use the $200 million or $250 million of gold which will help our balance of payments. I think it is in our interest, particularly in view of the fact that the sales are being made by other countries.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, could you discuss some of the recent public accounts of CIA activities in South Viet-Nam, particularly the stories or reports of how the CIA has undertaken certain independent operations, or independent of other elements of the American Government, that are in South Viet-Nam?;THE PRESIDENT. I must say I think the reports are wholly untrue. The fact of the matter is that Mr. McCone sits in the National Security Council. I imagine I see him at least three or four times a week, ordinarily. We have worked very closely together in the National Security Council in the last a months attempting to meet the problems we faced in South Viet-Nam. I can find nothing, and I have looked through the record very carefully over the last 9 months, and I could go back further, to indicate that the CIA has done anything but support policy. It does not create policy, it attempts to execute it in those areas where it has competence and responsibility. I know that the transfer of Mr. John Richardson, who is a very dedicated public servant, has led to surmises. But I can just assure you flatly that the CIA has not carried out independent activities but has operated under close control of the Director of Central Intelligence, operating with the cooperation of the National Security Council and under my instructions.;So I think that while the CIA may have made mistakes, as we all do, on different occasions, and has had many successes which may go unheralded, in my opinion in this case it is unfair to charge them as they have been charged. I think they have done a good job.;[3.] Q. Mr. President, you are meeting tomorrow with Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko under somewhat different conditions than you met a year ago. I am wondering if you would care to give us your assessment of the principal objective of your talk tomorrow with him?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, this continues to be an exchange of views on those matters which are at issue between the Soviet Union and the United States. In my speech before the General Assembly, I indicated those areas where the Soviet Union and the United States had disagreement. It is my hope that those disagreements will not lead to war. I am hopeful that what has happened in the last months will lessen that prospect. Really, what has happened since a year ago when I saw Mr. Gromyko will lessen the prospect of a military clash. But the differences go on. The systems are very different.;Mr. Khrushchev has said that there is no coexistence in the field of ideology. There are bound to be very severe matters which concern us on which the Soviet Union and the United States have very different views. As we don't want these disputes and frictions to escalate into military dashes, it is worthwhile to have consultations. The Secretary of State has been having them for several weeks, and I will see Mr. Gromyko this afternoon to just go over the ground which has already been laid by the Secretary of State.;Q. Mr. President, will you discuss with Mr. Gromyko the joint moon project proposal that you made before the U.N., and, if not, will that be pursued through some other channels?;THE PRESIDENT. We have received no response to our--to that proposal, which followed other proposals made on other occasions. As I said, our space program from the beginning has been oriented towards the peaceful use of space. That is the way the National Space Agency was set up. That is the position we have taken since my predecessor's administration. I said this summet that we were anxious to cooperate in the peaceful exploration of space, but to do so, of course, requires the breakdown of a good many barriers which still exist. It is our hope those barriers, which represent barriers of some hostility, some suspicion, secrecy, and the rest, will come down. If they came down, of course, it would be possible for us to cooperate. So far, as you know, the cooperation has been limited to some exchange of information on weather and other rather technical areas.;We have had no indication, in short, that the Soviet Union is disposed to enter into the kind of relationship which would make a joint exploration of space or to the moon possible. But I think it is important that the United States continue to emphasize its peaceful interest and its preparation to go quite far in attempting to end the barrier which has existed between the Communist world and the West and to attempt to bring, as much as we can, the Communist world into the free world of diversity which we seek. So the matter may come up. But I must say we have had no response which would indicate that they are going to take us up on it.;[4.] Q. Mr. President, in the reported agreement in principle between Russia and the United States to ban nuclear weapons from outer space, has the issue of verification come up in any way, and if so, sir, in what way?;THE PRESIDENT. No, there is not an agreement. The United States has stated it would not put weapons in outer space. We have no military use for doing so, and we would not do so. The Soviet Union has stated that it does not intend to. We are glad of that. There is no way we can verify that, but we are glad to hear the intention. We must recognize that there is no secure method of determining that someday they may not decide to do so. So we obviously have to take our own precautions. But we do not intend to, although we intend to protect our security, and we are glad to hear the Soviet Union does not intend to.;This is a matter, it seems to me, that can be best handled not through any bilateral agreement, but as a General Assembly matter, because other countries may someday have the same capability, and I think every country should declare that they are not going to put atomic weapons in the atmosphere, which could threaten not only the security of a potential adversary, but our own security, if for some reason the weapons should miscalculate and descend on us. I think it is a good thing to keep them out of the atmosphere.;[5.] Q. Mr. President, last week in California, you said something that led some people to believe that you had changed your opposition to a shorter workweek. Is that correct?;THE PRESIDENT. No, no, I am still opposed to it. What I was talking about was that inevitably as the century goes on, in my judgment, as machines increasingly take the place of men, that we will have more leisure, and therefore we should take those steps in the field of conservation, resource development, and recreation, which will prepare us for that period. But that is not talking about today or tomorrow. It would be a great mistake for us to reduce our 40-hour workweek now. It would affect our competitive position abroad, and I think that the needs of American production are such that we ought to stick with our 40-hour week. I see the time coming, as I was saying, at the end of the century, perhaps sooner than that, when there may be a change in that, but not now.;[6.] Q. Could you say, sir, how our policy is progressing in Viet-Nam in meeting what you established as desirable last month, a change of personnel and a change of policy that would help the government there better get on with the war?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think that there have been significant changes of the kind that--;Q. For better or worse?;THE PRESIDENT. I say I don't think there have been changes in the situation in the last month. I think we are still dealing with the same problems we were dealing with a month ago.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, was Assistant Secretary Martin's statement cleared with you, and if so, does it represent a reversal of your policy on dictatorships in Latin America?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I was informed generally of what Mr. Martin was saying, and in fact, I re-read it this afternoon. In the first place, our policy is not reversed. If attention could be drawn to Secretary Rusk's statement of Friday evening 1 in regard to the coups in the Dominican Republic and Honduras, we made it very clear that we are opposed to an interruption of the constitutional system by a military coup, not only because we are all committed under the Alliance for Progress to democratic government and progress and 'progressive government, but also because of course dictatorships are the seedbeds from which communism ultimately springs up.;1 Secretary Rusk's statement of October 4 is published in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 49. p. 624). The statement by Edwin M. Martin, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, is also published therein (vol. 49, p. 698).;So we are opposed to military coups, and it is for that reason that we have broken off our relations with the Dominican Republic and Honduras. It is for that reason that we attempted to work on the situation in Peru, which led, I think in part because of the American effort, mostly because of the Peruvian people's effort, to free elections.;Mr. Martin was merely attempting to explain some of the problems in Latin America, why coups take place, and what problems they present us with. But we are opposed to coups, because we think that they are defeating, self-defeating, and defeating for the hemisphere, and we are using our influence and I am sure the other countries of the hemisphere are using their influence in those areas where coups have taken place to provide for an orderly restoration of constitutional processes.;Q. Beyond the immediate action, sir, in relation to the Dominican Republic and Honduras, does the United States plan any general enunciation of policy in regard to military regimes, or does it contemplate asking any general hemispheric action in regard to this?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have just described, I have just attempted to describe what our policy is towards coups. And as far as our national policy, it was described on Friday, with the withdrawal of our diplomatic--our Ambassadors, our aid, our military assistance, and all the rest. So I think we have made very clear our policy and our interest in providing for a return to, as I have said, constitutional processes in those two countries.;We are working with the other members of the Organization of American States so that together we can bring about a return to order in those countries and a return to peaceful procedures. That is the policy of the United States. I have just enunciated it again.;Q. I was asking specifically, sir, whether the United States contemplated any broader hemispheric action in terms of general action by the OAS in this respect.;THE PRESIDENT. Not at this time. This is a matter which I think all the other countries of the OAS have to decide what they are going to do. I think the United States has made its position very clear.;Q. Mr. President, are you satisfied in retrospect that the United States did all it could, short of the use of force, to prevent the Dominican and Honduran coups?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I am. I have looked over the conversations, the minutes, of cables and so on, and I think we did. This idea that we ought to send the United States Marines into Honduras, which, of course, we couldn't have done under the conditions, because of the time gap, I think is a very serious mistake. That is not the way, in my opinion, and I think Mr. Martin was attempting to explain that that is not the way for democracy to flourish.;So I think we did the best we could. It may be possible to always do better, but we did the best we could, and we are going to continue to do so.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, there is a widespread impression that you expect Senator Barry Goldwater to be the Republican nominee for President next year. I think your speech in Salt Lake City had something to do with that. Is that your expectation?;THE PRESIDENT. I think he can do it. I think it is possible for him to do it. But he has a long road to go, recalling the situation in September 1959, October 1959. I think Senator Goldwater has a trying 7 or 8 months which will test his endurance and his perseverance and his agility.;Q. Are you basing that on your own experience in 1960?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. Former President Eisenhower wrote recently in an article that he was unclear about Senator Goldwater's views on certain major issues. I wonder, sir, whether you share this uncertainty and if so how you think Senator Goldwater should better express himself.;THE PRESIDENT. Senator Goldwater is speaking frequently, and he is saying what he thinks as of the time he speaks, and I think, therefore, we have an opportunity to make a judgment of where he stands. I don't think Senator Goldwater has ever been particularly deceptive. I think he has made very clear what he is opposed to, what he is for. I have gotten the idea. I think that President Eisenhower will, as time goes on.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, to keep the ball rolling, there are a couple of obvious candidates in another party who say they are going to make their announcement of their decisions in December or January. Have you set a timetable for yourself or are you already a candidate?;THE PRESIDENT. No, no, I think I will wait--this next year--I can wait longer.;[10.] Q. Mr. President, the Valachi crime committee hearings are getting very mixed reviews. As a former congressional investigator, I wonder whether you feel they are serving any useful purpose?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I wouldn't want--I haven't commented on the Senate procedures and I wouldn't now on this hearing or other hearings. That is a judgment for Senator McClellan and the committee. I do think that we shouldn't get a distorted idea from the hearings. I think--particularly as Columbus Day comes up I think there may be some feeling of some people that the name Valachi perhaps causes embarrassment to other American citizens. I don't think it should. These difficulties occur in a good many different racial groups, and I think that they ought to feel a good deal of pride in what they have done and not be concerned because a Valachi or an Irish name or some other name may occasionally get in trouble.;[11.] Q. Mr. President, Congressman Pucinski of Illinois has said to me, and I think he has proposed to Secretary Wirtz, that we should have three categories instead of two in our labor statistics, general statistics. He is proposing that we have employed, unemployed, and unemployables, because of their lack of skills. Would you agree with the Congressman that this would be helpful in highlighting the problem we have in employment and education?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't want to put it in that kind of a category. I think I can see there might be some merit in trying to mark out those who are unemployed because of structural unemployment, those who are unemployed because of the seasonal nature of their work, those who are unemployed because of illiteracy or lack of motivation. I think all that information--we have a good deal of it--a good deal of technical information, but I don't think I would label anybody in the United States unemployable.;[12.] Q. Mr. President, how do you feel about Senator Gruening's proposal to set up a congressional committee as a watchdog over the CIA?;THE PRESIDENT. I think the present committees--there's one in both the House and Senate which maintains very close liaison with the CIA--are best, considering the sensitive nature of the Central Intelligence Agency's work.;As you know, there is a congressional committee in the House, one in the Senate, composed of members of the Appropriations Committee and the Armed Services Committee. They meet frequently with Mr. McCone. He also testifies before the Foreign Relations Committees of House and Senate and the general Armed Services Committee. And I think the Congress has through that organization the means of keeping a liaison with him.;In addition, I have an Advisory Council which was headed by Dr. Killjan formerly, now Mr. Clark Clifford, which includes Jimmie Doolittle and others, and Robert Murphy, who also served as an advisory committee to me on the work of the intelligence community. I am well satisfied with the present arrangement.;[13.] Q. Sir, there seems to be some connection between the attempt of the State Department to discharge Mr. Otto Otepka, the Security Officer, there seems to be some connection between the fact that he gave much information to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee about various employees of the State Department--William Arthur Wieland and Walt W. Rostow and many others. Also Secretary Rusk has now put forth an order that employees of the State Department cannot talk or give information to this congressional committee. Isn't that a direct violation of law?;THE PRESIDENT. No, it isn't.;Q. That Government employees are allowed to give information to Members of Congress and to committees?;THE PRESIDENT, By what means? You mean secret dispatches?;Q. Well, any information. The law doesn't say what it will be. It says that any Government employee can give information to Members of Congress or to the committees.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, let me just say that the Secretary of State has been prepared to testify since August before the Internal Security Committee and discuss the case very completely;Q. Well, but--;THE PRESIDENT. Excuse me. There was a hearing scheduled for early September, but because of the Labor Day weekend that hearing did not take place. The Secretary of State stands ready, he is the responsible officer. Now the best thing to do is to give the Secretary of State a chance to explain the entire case, because in all frankness your analysis of it is not complete.;Q. Would you like to complete it, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I will be glad to have the Secretary of State talk to the Internal Security Committee about what it is that has caused action to be taken, administrative action within the Department of State, to be taken against the gentleman that you have named, the kind of actions he carried out, what the law said, how he met the law, how he didn't meet the law. This is all a matter which is going to be heard by the State Department board. Then it will be heard by the Civil Service Commission for review. Then it can be discussed in the courts.;In the meanwhile the Senate subcommittee can have all the information that it requires as to why Secretary Rusk has taken the action that he has. I think that is the best procedure. And I can assure you that I will examine the matter myself, when it comes time, as the Secretary of State will, who bears the responsibility, when it comes time to take any disciplinary action, if such a time does come.;[14.] Q. Mr. President, last spring there were selective price increases in steel, recently there have been price increases in steel. Are you concerned about these increases, sir, and do you feel you are going to take any action about them?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we are watching very carefully the rises which have taken place in certain industries. This country has avoided an inflationary spiral. We see no reason why there should be one now. The Wholesale Price Index has remained relatively constant for 5 years. We are concerned that price increases in one or two basic areas may stimulate other price increases which will affect adversely our competitive position abroad, and therefore affect our balance of payments, therefore affect our national interest.;In addition, profits are at a record high now--they have never been higher in history. The whole year of 1963 looks very good and, therefore, we should be concerned also with reducing prices as well as increasing them. For the time being we are watching the matter with concern and will continue in the days ahead to do so.;[15.] Q. Mr. President, has there been an official ruling that giving commercial credits to Russia would not violate the Johnson act?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, that is correct, because it is not a government-to-government transaction.;Q. It is not a government-to-government?;THE PRESIDENT. It is not a government-togovernment. These are private traders that will be involved and the credit will be granted by banks. In the case of Canada, as you know, the terms were 25 percent down, 25 percent then for every 6 months for a period of 18 months. But because the interest rate was of a certain figure, I think 4 7/8 percent, the Soviets decided to pay cash and, therefore, paid something like 80 percent cash. We will be dealing on the same matter with them on interest rates. Our interest rates would be slightly higher than the Canadian rate, possibly, under the private commercial system, and it may be that they will decide, therefore, to pay a very large percentage in cash.;But I have gotten a ruling from the Department of Justice that this does not contravene existing laws, particularly the Johnson act.;Q. Will the grain dealers take the risk, then?;THE PRESIDENT. The grain dealers will take the risk with the private banks.;[16.] Q. Mr. President, former head of the CIA Allen Dulles said in an interview in the Journal American today that reports of disputes between the CIA and the State Department and various branches of the government in South Viet-Nam have arisen because "of a lack of a clearcut operational policy in Washington." And he goes on to say that he thinks what is needed is less backbiting between U.S. agency officials. In view of the defense you just gave CIA, would you care to agree with the Dulles charge or contest it?;THE PRESIDENT. I would agree with the last part of it, that the agencies--as we all know, they are faced with a very difficult problem in South Viet-Nam, which we are all familiar with, both on the military and political side. Men have different views about what actions we should take, and they talk to members of the press, to all of you, in Saigon and here in Washington. But I must say that as of today, and I think this is particularly true since General Taylor and Secretary McNamara came back, I know of no disagreement between the State Department at the top, CIA at the top, Defense at the top, the White House and Ambassador Lodge, on what our basic policies will be and what steps we will take to implement it. Now if down below there is disagreement, I think in part it will be because they are not wholly informed of what actions we are taking. Some of them are necessarily confidential. But I think our policy, though we can't say what effect it is going to have, I think we are in agreement about what we ought to do. I would think that Saigon, and personnel in the various agencies, should support that policy, because that is the policy we are going to carry out for a while.;[17.] Q. Mr. President, if I understood you correctly on the wheat statement, you said the Russian people will know they are receiving American wheat.;THE PRESIDENT. That is correct.;Q. Is that by some agreement with the Soviet Union or how would that come about?;THE PRESIDENT. No, but we have our own means of informing the Soviet Union. As you know, for many months the Voice of America has not been blocked, for example, and therefore we believe that we have adequate means to inform the Russian people of the arrangement.;In addition, I am not sure that there is any reason for the Russians themselves to keep it quiet as it is a commercial transaction. But in any case, we have the means to provide that knowledge.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, as the election year approaches, there is an unusual amount of political activity already, as the questions reflect. I wonder if you would give us your thinking as an experienced politician as to the prime assets of your administration next year, and the prime liabilities of your administration?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that you would not want to--as we only have a relatively short time, I think we ought to make a judgment on that in 1964. And I say that without any--a lot of these matters we will have to decide whether the United States is better off economically than it was before, and whether our position in the world has improved, and whether our prospects for peace are greater, and whether our defenses are stronger, and whether we are making progress at home and abroad. That is a matter which it seems to me will be argued very strongly in '64. For example, we can't make a judgment about the state of the economy in '64. I think if they pass our tax bill, we are going to be able to demonstrate a very successful, ebullient economy for a period of 4 years. If they do not, we will have a different situation.;I cannot tell what our relations will be in Southeast Asia a year from now. I know what results our policy is attemptins to bring. But I think that result ought to be judged in the summer of '64 and the fall of '64, and I have hopes that the judgment will be that the economy is moving ahead, that the rate of growth has been almost $100 billion, will have been from about $500 billion to $600 billion, that we are substantially stronger militarily, that the chances of war have been reduced over Berlin and perhaps in other areas. But I would not want to make those judgments now, because I think we still have a long way to go before next summer, and I think that to say that this is the end of the road would be a mistake. I think we ought to be judged by what we do over a 4-year period, and that is the way it is going to be. It is too early now.;[19.] Q. Could I ask one final thing, sir? Have you brought back any dominant impressions from your two recent trips in the West and South, political impressions?;THE PRESIDENT. I would say we are going to have a hard, close fight in 1964. But that has been my impression for a good many months.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Kennedy: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">October 31, 1963</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon.;[1.] Q. Mr. President, I wonder, could you tell us something about this Government's policy toward reports we hear from Europe and from here about removal of American forces from Europe, or reduction in the size or the strength of American personnel in Europe?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think that Secretary Rusk explained quite clearly the American policy last weekend, as he reaffirmed it. The policy of the United States is to maintain 6 divisions in Germany, as long as they are required. In addition to these 6 divisions, and over and above our NATO commitments, we sent to Germany as temporary reinforcements during the Berlin crisis of 1961, 6 combat units consisting of 3 artillery battalions, 2 armored battalions, and 1 armored cavalry regiment.;This augmentation of U.S. forces in Germany was made to help meet the deficiency of other NATO members in fulfilling their commitments at a very crucial time when the buildup of West Germany's own forces was incomplete. Although some of these deficiencies have been corrected, and the German force buildup is progressing, we are prepared to keep these additional combat units in Germany as long as there is a need for them.;Thus, we are not planning any reduction in United States combat units in Germany. As part of the reorganization of the Army's European logistic forces, we are planning some reduction in noncombat personnel, a matter on which of course we are in touch with our allies.;But we do not intend to bring back any units or personnel whose return would impair the military effectiveness of our forces in Germany. In short, we intend to keep our combat forces in Germany as they are today--that is, more than 6 combat divisions.;Q.,Mr. President, that being so, how many human beings are we going to bring back from our European stations now?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, any we bring back may include some supply forces or--;Q. As much as a regiment, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have over, I think, 240,000 or 250,000, so a regiment is a very small--less than a percent of that, so I am sure that there will be movements in and out. But we are talking about the whole European theater. But, in the case of Germany, and I think it is important to make this clear, the 6 divisions which are our NATO commitment, are being kept. In addition, these other combat units are being kept in Germany also. If there is any change in personnel, and I am sure there will be some, it will be in logistic forces. There have been some changes, for example, in our logistic supply lines in France. There may be some changes in headquarters units and all the rest. They are relatively small. They may be spaced over a period of time. But our combat effectiveness, of course, is increasing as our materiel increases.;Q. Will these 6 divisions, sir, be kept at conventional divisional strength?;THE PRESIDENT. That is correct. There will be no change, no change in the number of combat forces in Germany, no change in the number of these extra forces which, as I have said, are beyond our NATO commitment but which will be also kept in Germany.;Q. Mr. President, you spoke of some deficiencies. Who is falling short?;THE PRESIDENT. We are talking about deficiencies in 1961, when we were having a serious crisis in Berlin and where the NATO forces were inadequate. And, as you know, I think the Secretary of State made a reference to the fact that a number of our allies had not, and in some cases have not, met their NATO commitments today, with the number of forces that should be stationed in Germany for the defense of Germany.;Q. But we still have to keep these troops there, although apparently, because--;THE PRESIDENT. There has been a buildup since 1961, particularly among the German forces, whose target is 12 divisions. Some other countries have not met their quota. But we are keeping our forces there primarily because we believe that it emphasizes the commitment of the United States to the defense of the Federal Republic, and our concern about the defense of Europe. In addition, it should be pointed out that the Federal Republic, West Germany, is purchasing military equipment in the United States which provides an offset to our gold losses for our forces in the Federal Republic. So they are making an effort and so are we, and we are going to continue to do it.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Goldwater accused your administration today of falsification of the news in order to perpetuate irself in office. Do you care to comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. What was he referring to?;Q. He was making a speech here at the Women's National Press Club, and his point was that you and your administration are mismanaging the news, and using it to perpetuate yourself in office.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as I have said before, I think it would be unwise at this time to answer or reply to Senator Goldwater. I am confident that he will be making many charges even more serious than this one in the coming months. And, in addition, he himself has had a busy week selling TVA and giving permission to or suggesting that military commanders overseas be permitted to use nuclear weapons, and attacking the President of Bolivia while he was here in the United States, and involving himself in the Greek election. So I thought it really would not be fair for me this week to reply to him.;[3.] Q. Mr. President, back to the question of troop reductions, are any intended in the Far East at the present time, particularly in Korea, and is there any speedup in the withdrawal from Viet-Nam intended?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as you know, when Secretary McNamara and General Taylor came back, they announced that we would expect to withdraw a thousand men from South Viet-Nam before the end of the year, and there has been some reference to that by General Harkins. If we are able to do that, that would be our schedule. I think the first unit or first contingent would be 250 men who are not involved in what might be called front-line operations. It would be our hope to lessen the number of Americans there by 1,000, as the training intensifies and is carried on in South Viet-Nam. As far as other units, we will have to make our judgement based on what the military correlation of forces may be. We are becoming increasingly mobile, as the Big Lift Operation suggests.;What is important in the case that Mr. Smith was talking about, we not only have these divisions that I described there, but we have--after the '61 experience, we moved equipment for 2 more divisions. So during the Big Lift, we actually have 7 divisions. So that we are able to move around the world much faster, and with new planes which are beginning to come off the production line, particularly the ones in Marietta, Ga., out of Lockheed. And so we are going to have increased airlift capacity over the next 2 or 3 years. So naturally our force will be more mobile.;[4.] Q. Mr. President, on the basis of your experience in Philadelphia, yesterday and last night, will you regard next Tuesday's mayoral election as a test of how civil rights will affect the voting?;THE PRESIDENT. In Philadelphia, or just--;Q. In Philadelphia, yes--as well as in other large northern cities.;THE PRESIDENT. I am sure that that may be a factor in the election, although I am not sure that the two candidates have taken different positions, but I suppose this is a matter of major concern in the country today, and it may be reflected in the voting. As I say, I am not aware, although it may be, that the candidates have taken different positions on it. My guess would be that they have taken relatively the same position on the question.;Q. The question is whether or not there will be some backlash from white minority voters against the Democrats because of their pushing of civil rights.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I--it is possible. We will have to wait and see, though, as I have said from the beginning, it seems to me both parties have taken a clear position historically and at present on civil rights. But there may be. We will have to wait and see Tuesday, and I am sure that a good many things will be written into it.;[5.] Q. Mr. President, the United Nations Secretary General U Thant has withdrawn the mission from Yemen, which was supposed to secure peace and the withdrawal of Nasser's troops from Yemen. Since you are sponsoring this effort, could you tell us what further steps you have in mind?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, he is keeping his political people there and we are still hopeful that the governments of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.R. will come to some conclusion, either bilaterally or with the Secretary General, which will permit the cease-fire to be maintained, and the withdrawal which has been limited to be expanded. So, I have not given up on the hope of keeping that cease-fire.;Q. [Inaudible].--is not thinking of any bilateral moves?;THE PRESIDENT. No. We have expressed our great interest in seeing that fighting does not break out along the border, and I think it would be unfortunate if it did. We have indicated that to the countries involved. I am hopeful, as I say, that perhaps they will be able to work it out bilaterally, or at least keep a cease-fire.;[6.] Q. Mr. President, do you think the letters that Secretary of the Navy Korth wrote made his resignation advisable, and was it requested?;THE PRESIDENT. I think the letters which Mr. Korth and I exchanged explain the situation as I would like to see it explained.;Mr. Korth, I think, worked hard for the Navy and he indicated his desire to return to private life and I accepted that decision. But I think he worked hard for the Navy.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, thousands of jobs are lost every week to automation. The Federal Government is one of the leaders in automation. Do you think it is good for us, as human beings, to dehumanize work and sacrifice people to machines and money?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it is all a question of degree and how it is done. Obviously, most of the comforts we now enjoy are the result of automation, technology over a period of 100 or 150 years, and there were, historically, efforts at various times to stop the introduction of machines which made the labor of men easier.;So automation does not need to be, we hope, our enemy. What is of concern now is this combination of a rather intensive period of automation, plus the fact that our educational system is not keeping up, so that we are graduating or dropping out of high school so many millions of young men and women who are not able to operate in this new society who have only physical labor to perform and they can't find enough jobs.;So that is what concerns us. Now, as you know, job retraining is important in that area, vocational training. We are trying to combat school dropouts, trying to urge families to keep their children in school, and all the rest of these efforts with which you are familiar.;We have a proposal before the Congress for a new analysis of automation. In answer to your question: I think machines can make life easier for men, if men do not let the machines dominate them. And it is our intention to try to see that life is easier. The fact is, life is easier because of machines, and I think it can provide new jobs, but I think it is going to take a good deal of wisdom by those of us in the Government as well as labor and management.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, last week there was a certain amount of optimism that a sale of wheat would soon be reached for the Soviet Union. And a lot of this optimism seems to be gone in the last couple of days. I wonder if you could tell us quite precisely what seems to be holding up the sale and whether you are optimistic that the sale will go through?;THE PRESIDENT. We are involved in negotiations which, of course, are very intensive and it seems to me that this is the week when these negotiations are reaching a critical phase. I don't think that it would be useful for me to comment on them. I think we ought to know in the next days whether we are going to be successful in completing our sale. But obviously this is a matter in which the seller and the buyer have interests which are not always harmonious and we have to reach the best bargain possible. That is what they want and that is what we want, and so I think we ought to let the negotiators negotiate.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, do you expect to use General David Shoup's services in the Government after he leaves?;THE PRESIDENT. I would hope so. I would hope so--if he will--I would like to have him stay.;[10.] Q. Mr. President, just shortly after the Bay of Pigs I asked you how you liked being President, and as I remember you said you liked it better before the event. Now you have had a chance to appraise your job, and why do you like it and why do you want to stay in office 4 more years?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I find the work rewarding. Whether I am going to stay and what my intentions are and all of the rest, it seems to me it is still a good many, many months away. But as far as the job of President goes, it is rewarding. And I have given before to this group the definition of happiness of the Greeks, and I will define it again: it is full use of your powers along lines of excellence. I find, therefore, the Presidency provides some happiness.;[11.] Q. Mr. President, there have been persistent reports in recent days that the State Department is negotiating with the Junta in the Dominican Republic looking toward a resumption of full diplomatic relations. Are these reports true, and is there some basis on which we would be willing to recognize the present Junta?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there have been conversations in the Dominican Republic to see what assurances can be given regarding the restoration of democratic rule, constitutional rule in the Dominican Republic. We have a charge d'affaires there, and quite obviously we are interested in that restoration. Those assurances are of free elections, so we are continuing to carry out these discussions, although actually they are relatively informal, and they have reaped no harvest as yet. But that would be our policy to attempt to see if we can resume relations with the Dominican Republic under assurances of a restoration of constitutional government. As yet we have had no success.;[12.] Q. Sir, when you approved the sale of wheat to the Soviet Union, you placed a condition on the sales that the shipments be in U.S. flagships to the extent that they were available. I wonder if you could explain to us how you came to place this condition on it, what the genesis of that condition was.;THE PRESIDENT. No, I think we ought to let the negotiators negotiate this week. I don't mean to be evasive, but I think we ought to let those who are representing the United States point of view, we ought to give them a free hand. So I would rather not get into a discussion of the wheat deal. Next week I am sure we can.;[13.] Q. Mr. President, could you tell us how many Russian troops there are in Cuba now and what you--;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't think we can ever give a precise figure. All I can say is that the numbers have steadily been reduced, and in the last 2 months there have been further reductions and since the first of January there has been a marked decrease in the number of troops in Cuba, according to all our. intelligence estimates. I couldn't give you a precise number that are still there, but I can give you a--the general trend is outward.;[14.] Q. Mr. President, since you approved the w-heat sale, other groups have come along and suggested we sell other products to the Russians, too, surplus butter, for example. And Congressman Cooley says maybe if we send them some tobacco it will quiet their nerves a little bit. Would you favor expanding this list to other farm surpluses, if they are interested?;THE PRESIDENT. They have shown no. interest in anything else, but they may show interest if this deal is consummated, and I would be responsive to any further request they made for farm commodities. But first, we have to get this deal. I think this is the bellwether.;[15.] Q. Mr. President, can you explain Secretary McNamara's rejection of the atomic power plant for the new carrier in the face of the experts, like Admiral Rickover and Chairman Seaborg, and others who think it is necessary? And will the same policy go over to the other warships that the Navy wants, of over 8,000 tons, with the atomic energy power?;THE PRESIDENT. No, we are going to build a conventional carrier, which has already been announced at this time. That is what we think that the Navy needs. Now, we are not going to make any final decision until a later date on whether we are going to have nuclear power for important ships of the Navy.;As you suggest, there is no use having a nuclear carrier unless we have the ships that accompany it--and after all, there is a large train with a carrier--unless they have nuclear power. So that it requires a rather large investment. In the case of the nuclear carrier, it is about $160 million or $170 million more. If you add up the other ships that might have to accompany it, it gets into a large sum of money. What is the mission of that carrier? What is it going to be used for--limited war or strategic attack? What is the best use of that extra money? I think I am supporting Secretary McNamara in the decision that he has made so far in this matter.;[16.] Q. Mr. President, the United States Steel Corporation has rejected the idea that it should use economic pressure in an effort to improve race relations in Birmingham, Ala. Do you have any comments on that position and do you have any counsel for management and labor in general as to their social responsibility in areas of tension of this kind?;THE PRESIDENT. Actually, Mr. Blough has been somewhat helpful in one or two cases that I can think of in Birmingham. I don't think he should narrowly interpret his responsibility for the future. That is a very influential company in Birmingham, and he wants to see that city prosper, as do we all.;Obviously, the Federal Government cannot solve this matter, so that business has a responsibility--labor, and of course every citizen. So I would think that particularly a company which is as influential as United States Steel in Birmingham, I would hope would use its influence on the side of comity between the races.;Otherwise, the future of Birmingham, of course, is not as happy as we would hope it would be. In other words, it can't be decided, this matter, in Washington. It has to be decided by citizens everywhere. Mr. Blough is an influential citizen. I am sure he will do the best he can.;[17.] Q. Mr. President, you have signed one Executive order and one law banning conflicts of interest on the part of executive branch employees. In the light of recent events on Capitol Hill, do you think that that law should be broadened to cover members of Congress and congressional employees?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think that we ought to wait until the investigation is over. It has only begun, and it is a matter which Congress of course would have to consider. But I think that perhaps out of the investigation there may come a decision to develop new rules, procedures, or laws, but I would rather wait until the Congress has had the hearing and then we can make a better judgment about that.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, do you think that Premier Khrushchev has actually taken the Soviet Union out of the so-called moon race, and in any case do you think that the United States should proceed as if there were a moon race?;THE PRESIDENT. I didn't read that into his statement. I thought his statement was rather cautiously worded and I did not get any assurances that Mr. Khrushchev or the Soviet Union were out of the space race at all.;I think it is remarkable that some people who were so unwilling to accept our test ban treaty, where there was a very adequate area of verification of whatever the Soviet Union was doing, were perfectly ready to accept Mr. Khrushchev's very guarded, careful, cautious remark that he was taking himself out of the space race and use that as an excuse for us to abandon our efforts.;The fact of the matter is that the Soviets have made an intensive effort in space, and there is every indication that they are continuing and that they have the potential to continue. I would read Mr. Khrushchev's remarks very carefully. I think that he said before anyone went to the moon, there should be adequate preparation. We agree with that.;In my opinion the space program we have is essential to the security of the United States, because as I have said many times before, it is not a question of going to the moon. It is a question of having the competence to master this environment. And I would not make any bets at all upon Soviet intentions. I think that our experience has been that we wait for deeds, unless we have a system of verification, and we have no idea whether the Soviet Union is going to make a race for the moon or whether it is going to attempt an even greater program.;I think we ought to stay with our program. I think that is the best answer to Mr. Khrushchev.;Q. Mr. President, it still continues to be the fact that we have had no responses to your proposal for a joint moon exploration?;THE PRESIDENT. That is correct. In addition, the two astronauts of the Soviet Union earlier that week had made a statement saying the Soviet Union was prepared to go on lunar expeditions, so I think that we should not disregard our whole carefully worked out program which is being carried on very impressively in Huntsville, Ala., and in other places, merely because Mr. Khrushchev gave a rather Delphic interview to some correspondents.;[19.] Q. Mr. President, Fidel Castro claims to have captured some Americans whom he says are CIA agents, and he says he is going to execute them. Is there anything at all that you can tell us about this?;THE PRESIDENT. No, no.;[20.] Q. Mr. President, what is the status of the bilateral air transport agreement between the United States and Russia?;THE PRESIDENT. It was initialed some months ago, more than a year ago, in fact a year and a half ago, and there are still some technical matters which have to be discussed before it can be formally signed.;Q. Are you optimistic of it being signed, and if so, when?;THE PRESIDENT. I think there is a good chance it will be signed, yes.;[21.] Q. Mr. President, as you know, the plan to build a National Environmental Health Research Center has been hung up in Congress. Apparently they can't decide where to build it. Now there is a report that you would like it built in North Carolina. Would you?;THE PRESIDENT. North Carolina would be very acceptable. I think the Budget recommendation was Maryland, but North Carolina does have the facilities. But I think in our recommendations we made, HEW made, the first recommendation was Maryland. The site in North Carolina is a good one, as there is a triangle there of colleges and hospitals and medical facilities. And I have indicated that that would be satisfactory, if that was the judgment of the Congress. I think our first choice was Maryland.;[22.] Q. Mr. President, in spite of something you said here in May 1962, there is talk that Lyndon Johnson will be dumped next year. Senator Thruston Morton used the word "purged." Now, sir, assuming that you run next year, would you want Lyndon Johnson on the ticket, and do you expect that he will be on the ticket?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, to both of those questions. That is correct.;[23.] Q. Mr. President, Navy Secretary Korth had some correspondence which indicated he worked very hard for the Continental National Bank of Fort Worth while he was in Government, as well as for the Navy, and that during this same period of time that he negotiated, or took part in the decision on a contract involving that bank's--one of that bank's best customers, the General Dynamics firm. I wonder if this fulfills the requirements of your Code of Ethics in Government, and if, in a general way, you think that it is within the law and proper?;THE PRESIDENT. In the case of the contract--the TFX contract--as you know, that matter was referred to the Department of Justice to see whether there was a conflict of interest and the judgment was that there was not. That is number one.;Number two, the amount of the loan to the company. That bank was one of a number of banks which participated in a line of credit and it was relatively a small amount of money, as bank loans go. So in answer to your question, I have no evidence that Mr. Korth acted in any way improperly in the TFX matter. It has nothing to do with any opinion I may have about whether Mr. Korth might have written more letters and been busier than he should have been in one way or another.;The fact of the matter is, I have no evidence that Mr. Korth benefited improperly during his term of office in the Navy. And I have no evidence, and you have not, as I understand it--the press has not produced any, nor the McClellan committee--which would indicate that in any way he acted improperly in the TFX. I always have believed that innuendoes should be justified before they are made, either by me, in the Congress, or even in the press.;[24.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Goldwater also said today that if he is nominated, the Republican--for the Republican President-if he is the Republican Presidential nominee, he will gladly debate you. Would you accept this challenge?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have indicated that I was going to debate if I were renominated.;[25.] Q. Mr. President, a number of your congressional leaders have said they favor the so-called quality stabilization bill, but all of your executive departments are opposed to it. Can you tell us what your views are on this legislation?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, that hasn't come to me as yet. I am not--I have never been for the quality stabilization bill. I will have to look at the bill when it finally comes and the form it is in. I can't comment on the legislation before it finally comes to the desk of the White House, but the administration witnesses have spoken my views.;[26.] Q. Mr. President, unemployment is just about as high today as it was a year ago, but there are rumors that the administration has given up on getting Congress to extend the accelerated public works program. Is this a fact?;THE PRESIDENT. NO. The amount of money that is in the public works program runs through July so that there is still a good deal of money that is available for public works under that program.;Q. Doesn't the act, sir, expire in January?;THE PRESIDENT. The amount of money, though, given the pipeline runs through July. So this is not a matter for immediate decision before us.;[27.] Q. Sir, would you please tell us what is going to be the final decision on Mr. Otto Otepka, the Security Officer of the State Department, who is up for firing? And would you please, in a related question, tell us what was the final decision on whether the State Department employees can go before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and answer questions?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't think any final decision has been made on Mr. Otepka. I think there is a hearing scheduled in the next few days on the matter. And I have said to you before that the Secretary of State would study the matter and so would I before any final decision is reached. Of course, if a decision is reached of the kind you describe, it would be possible for him to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.;Now, the question of--I have no objection, and I think it would be perfectly appropriate, for any employee of the Federal Government to appear before any congressional committee. I would think it would be proper that the head of the department would be notified, but I am sure that they will give permission.;[28.] Q. Mr. President, a little while ago you said that our present force of combat troops would remain in Germany as long as they are required. I wondered whether you planned to be the sole determiner of that or whether it would be a bilateral or a NATO-wide proposition.;THE PRESIDENT. I would think it would be a NATO--well, it would certainly be discussed in NATO, and, of course, the country particularly affected, in this case the Federal Republic. Its views would have very heavy weight, very heavy weight. I am sure that no action would be taken which would not meet the needs of the country involved, the Federal Republic as well as our own.;[29.] Q. Mr. President, in negotiating the limited nuclear test ban treaty we and the Russians avoided the issue of international inspection by limiting it to the three environments in which that, theoretically, was not required. Now we have joined at the U.N. in proposing a wider ban, including underground tests. Is there anything new in the state of the art of detection or in our understanding of the Soviet position that leads us to hope we can get anywhere with this approach?;THE PRESIDENT. I am doubtful that we can get any place. We are still insisting on inspection. The Soviet Union is still resisting inspection. And therefore, unless the art of seismology improves, I would think we would not get an agreement. Sometime it may improve so that it is not necessary for us to have the kind of detailed inspections that we believe necessary or perhaps the Soviet Union will change its policy. I would hope either event would occur. For the present, I am not optimistic.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Kennedy: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">November 14, 1963</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, gentlemen and ladies.;[1.] Q. Mr. President, how menacing do you regard the Cambodian threat to reject our foreign aid, and can that country be slipping into the Communist orbit?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I regard it as serious. It is my hope that Prince Sihanouk, who must be concerned about the independence and the sovereignty of his country-he has after all been involved for many years in maintaining that independence-will not decide at this dangerous point in the world's affairs to surrender it. I would think that he is more concerned about Cambodian independence than we are. After all, he is a Cambodian. So my judgment is that in the long run he would protect that independence. It would be folly not to, and I don't think he is a foolish man.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, how do you regard the case involving Professor Barghoorn, and what are we doing about getting his release from the Russian Government?;THE PRESIDENT. As you know, the American Ambassador--the United States Embassy has made six protests to the Soviet Government in the last 48 hours. Ambassador Kohler has been to the Soviet Foreign Ministry personally. The United States Government is deeply concerned about the unwarranted and unjustified arrest of Professor Barghoorn, by the fact that he was held for a number of days without the United States being informed of it, and that the United States officials in the Soviet Union have not had an opportunity to visit with him. He was not on an intelligence mission of any kind. He is a distinguished professor of Soviet affairs, he has played a most helpful and constructive role in arranging cultural exchanges, scientific exchanges. We are concerned not only for his personal safety, but because this incident, I think, can have a most serious effect upon what we understood the Soviet Government's strong hope was, certainly our hope, that we would find a widening of cultural intellectual exchanges. We have heard from a good many universities and private organizations, which have expressed their alarm--been taking part in these exchanges-and it is quite clear that the Professor's early release is essential if these programs are to be continued.;I can assure you that the Department of State, our Embassy in Moscow, will do everything it can to effect the early release of the Professor. His arrest is unjustified. I repeat again: he was not on an intelligence mission of any kind. I am hopeful that this will become quickly obvious to the Soviet Union and that they will release him.;Q. Mr. President, some persons view Professor Barghoorn's arrest as a sign the Soviets are now deliberately seizing innocent Americans with the aim of later swapping them for some of their convicted espionage agents or that the Soviets may be doing this with the hope of somehow extracting political concessions from us. How would you view any such tactics?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't think--obviously they would not be successful. I wouldn't attempt to make a judgment as to the conduct of the Soviet Union or what may motivate it from week to week, day to day, but I am certainly--it is quite obvious that if it is based on the presumptions you state, that it will not be successful.;[3.] Q. Mr. President, what are the prerequisites or conditions for resumption of some sort of trade with Red China?;THE PRESIDENT. We are not planning to trade with Red China in view of the policy that Red China pursues. When the Red Chinese indicate a desire to live at peace with the United States, with other countries surrounding it, then quite obviously the United States would reappraise its policies. We are not wedded to a policy of hostility to Red China. It seems to me Red China's policies are what create the tension between not only the United States and Red China but between Red China and India, between Red China and her immediate neighbors to the south, and even between Red China and other Communist countries.;[4.] Q. Mr. President, it now seems unlikely that you will get either your tax bill or your civil rights bill in this session of Congress. Does that disturb you?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think that the longer the delay, I think--yes, I think it is unfortunate. The fact of the matter is that both these bills should be passed. The tax bill has been before the Congress for nearly a year. The civil rights has been there for a much shorter time, it didn't go up until June. I am hopeful that the House will certainly act on that in the next month, maybe sooner. The tax bill hearings have been quite voluminous. It would seem to me that it might be possible to end those hearings and bring the matter to the floor of the Senate before the end of the year. Otherwise, the civil rights bill will come over after the first of the year. There may be a very long debate. The tax bill may be caught up in that. I suppose some people are hopeful that that is so, but I am not. And I think that the economy will suffer. The economy will suffer and I think that--I certainly would not want to be responsible for that. Therefore, I would like to get the tax bill out of the way quickly and this important piece of legislation. I would think the Members of Congress would.;[5.] Q. Mr. President, there have been published reports that General Harkins may have lost his usefulness in Viet-Nam because of his identification with the Diem regime and lack of contacts with the new generals running the country. Would you care to comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it is wholly untrue. I have complete confidence in him. He was just doing his job. I think he said in the interview yesterday he had seen Mr. Nhu, I think, only three times. He had seen President Diem on a number of occasions. That was his job, that is what he was sent for-to work with the government in power--that is what he will do with the new government. I have great confidence in General Harkins. There may be some who would like to see General Harkins go, but I plan to keep him there.;Q. Following up that, sir, would you give us your appraisal of the situation in South Viet-Nam now, since the coup, and the purposes for the Honolulu conference?;THE PRESIDENT. Because we do have a new situation there, and a new government, we hope, an increased effort in the war. The purpose of the meeting at Honolulu--Ambassador Lodge will be there, General Harkins will be there, Secretary McNamara and others, and then, as you know, later Ambassador Lodge will come here--is to attempt to assess the situation: what American policy should be, and what our aid policy should be, how we can intensify the struggle, how we can bring Americans out of there.;Now, that is our object, to bring Americans home, permit the South Vietnamese to maintain themselves as a free and independent country, and permit democratic forces within the country to operate--which they can, of course, much more freely when the assault from the inside, and which is manipulated from the north, is ended. So the purpose of the meeting in Honolulu is how to pursue these objectives.;Q. Mr. President, Madam Nhu has now left the United States, but indicated that she intends to return. Will we renew her tourist visa?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. And if she asks for it, will we grant her permanent residence--;THE PRESIDENT. I think we'd certainly permit her to return to the United States, if she wishes to do so.;[6.] Q. Mr. President, year by year, the foreign aid program seems to encounter more and more resistance in the Congress. And this year we are seeing Senators who ordinarily in the past have gone along with the program--;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. This is the worst attack on foreign aid that we have seen since the beginning of the Marshall plan.;Q. In the event that one of these years the Congress, the arguments for foreign aid notwithstanding, surprises itself by voting the program out, what would we then do?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it would be a great mistake. Of course, some of the difficulty is where the President sits and where the Members of the Senate sit. It has been said very many times, and I have never questioned it, that the Senate and the Congress have every right to decide how much money should be appropriated. That is their constitutional right.;But on the other hand, the President bears particular responsibilities in the field of foreign policy. If there are failures in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, and South Viet-Nam, Laos, it is usually not a Senator who is selected to bear the blame, but it's the administration, the President of the United States.;I regard this--President Eisenhower regarded it, and President Truman--it is no coincidence that all three Presidents since this program began, and Presidential candidates-Mr. Nixon, Mr. Stevenson, Governor Dewey, that all of them, Governor Rockefeller today, others--it seems to me all recognize the importance of this program. It is because it is a very valuable arm of the United States in the field of foreign policy. I don't think it is recognized what an important influence this has.;Now, we spend $51 billion or $52 billion on defense. We spend $2 1/2 billion on the atomic energy program. We spend $5 bib lion on space, of which at least a good percentage has a military implication in the sense of our national security. We spend all of this money and yet we are going to deny the President of the United States a very valuable weapon in maintaining the influence of the United States in this very diversified world.;I can't imagine anything more dangerous than to end this program. I can assure you that whoever is President of the United States succeeding me will support this program.;Now, the second point I want to make is that what we are now talking about is only a fourth of what we tried to do in the early fifties. What I said in the--I don't understand why we are suddenly so fatigued. I don't regard the struggle as over, and I don't think it is probably going to be over for this century. I think this is a continuing effort, and it is not a very heavy one. It is a fraction of our budget, a fraction of our gross national product. The gross national product of the United States has increased $100 billion, will have by the end of this year, in a 3-year period.;So what we are asking is a billion dollars less than in the average program since '47. The need today is greater, these countries are poorer, there's a good many more of them, and yet we are being denied, the President of the United States is being threatened with denying him a very important weapon in helping him meet his responsibility. The Congress has its responsibility. But in the field of foreign policy there are particular burdens placed on the President, whoever he may be.;The Supreme Court in the Curtis Rider case said that the President is the organ of the country in the field of foreign policy. I just want to say personally as President, and my predecessor said the same, this program is essential to the conduct of our foreign policy, and therefore I am asking the Congress of the United States to give me the means of conducting the foreign policy of the United States. And if they do not want to do so, then they should recognize that they are severely limiting my ability to protect the interest. That's how important I think this program is.;Q. Before you leave the subject, sir, would you comment just a bit further? It is still a fact that a negative action by a Congress is something that an administration has great difficulty in coping with. Has the administration, has the Government, looked ahead to that possibility and prepared against it?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I can't believe that the Congress of the United States is going to be so unwise unless we are going to retreat from the world. Are we going to give up in South Viet-Nam? Are we going to give up in Latin America?;I have said before that what we are talking about in the case of Latin America and the Alliance for Progress, for all of Latin America, is what the Soviet Union and the bloc are putting into Cuba alone. Now, can you tell me the United States is not able to do that? In addition, these amendments which are passed because they don't like a particular leader or a particular national policy as of the moment--it is a very changing world. Because they don't like the fishing policy we are going to decide to end all aid to the three countries in Latin America that are hard-pressed, rather than permitting us to negotiate the matter out. But anyway, as I say, they have their responsibilities and I have mine. I am just trying to make it very clear that I cannot fulfill my responsibility in the field of foreign policy without this program.;Now, the most important program, of course, is our national security, but I don't want the United States to have to put troops there. What's going to happen in Laos if it collapses? Are they going to blame the Senate or are they going to blame me? I know who they are going to blame. So I need this program.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, as a possible candidate for President, would you comment on the possible candidacy of Margaret Chase Smith, and specifically what effect that would have on the New Hampshire primary?;THE PRESIDENT. I would think if I were a Republican candidate, I would not look forward to campaigning against Margaret Chase Smith in New Hampshire-[laughter]--or as a possible candidate for President. I think she is very formidable, if that is the appropriate word to use about a very fine lady. She is a very formidable political figure!;[8.] Q. Mr. President, getting back to Professor Barghoorn for a moment, the negotiations for renewal of the exchange agreement with the Soviet Union were scheduled to begin next Tuesday, and now as I understand it have been postponed.;THE PRESIDENT. That is right.;Q. Do those negotiations depend upon the release of Professor Barghoorn?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think it is helpful to the Professor to try to put these conditions upon it. I just say that there's no sense having a program if a man who is innocent of any intelligence mission, which is true in this case, is subjected to arrest without means of defense. How can you carry on that kind of a program? I am sure that everybody would agree that it would be hopeless under these conditions.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, would you comment on the wheat deal with the Soviet Union, and tell us whether the Export-Import Bank, or whether any other agency of Government is doing more in this deal than it would for any friendly country?;THE PRESIDENT. No, it will not do more than it would for any friendly country. The matter is now in private negotiations, and I don't know what is going to happen on the deal.;[10.] Q. Would you expand, sir, on the changes in the travel restrictions for Soviet diplomats? For example, in Oregon there were five counties that were off limits during the last 2 years, and now it has been expanded to 13 counties. Could you expand on that?;THE PRESIDENT. In the case of the Soviet Union, 26 percent of their country is off limits to the United States, and we have put the same percentage of ours. If they would be willing to change that percentage and drop it, I think we would be willing to. Now, in the case of the bloc, we have attempted to put some limitations on the travel of bloc military attaches, because we feel that it is important to the security of the United States, and to the alliance. The base of the alliance rests upon the nuclear forces of the United States. I think we have to protect their security. And the Defense Department felt very strongly that this was important to the security of the United States, or otherwise it would not have been done.;[11.] Q. Mr. President, I think a few minutes ago you said it would be unfortunate if the tax bill and the civil rights bill don't get through. You just said also it is the worst attack on the foreign aid bill since its inception. Several appropriations bills are still hung up in Congress, the first time in history this late. What has happened on Capitol Hill?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, they are all interrelated. I think that there is some delay because of civil rights. That has had an effect upon the passage of appropriations bills. There isn't any question. On the other hand, of course, what we are talking about in both the civil rights bill and the tax bill are very complicated and important pieces of legislation, in fact more significant in their own way than legislation which has been sent up there for a decade. My judgment is that by the time this Congress goes home, in the sense of next summer, that in the fields of education, mental health, taxes, civil rights, this is going to be a record that is going to be--however dark it looks now, I think that "westward, look, the land is bright," and I think that by next summer it may be.;Q. In view of what you just said, sir, you listed certain items. You didn't mention medical care for the aged. Now, even though Chairman Mills has promised to hold hearings this month, there doesn't seem to be any immediate prospect of clearing it. Since he was so helpful on the tax bill, are you prepared to ask him to cast his vote to get that out of committee so the House can vote on it?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that we are going to get that bill out of committee--not this year, but next year--and I think we will have a vote on it, and I think it will pass. But I don't think it will pass this year, but I think it will next year. I did not mean to make an exclusive list. I am looking forward to the record of this Congress, but it may not come until--this is going to be an 18-month delivery!;[ 12.] Q. Mr. President, the bill--the program put forward by this distinguished committee of private citizens seemed to go farther than your bill on Medicare. Would you be prepared to sponsor a program, say, of Senator Javits joined with Senator Anderson in a bipartisan measure?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I am going to meet with them, and I think that that bill recognized the principle of social security. I thought it was a very valuable job because it was a bipartisan--the committee 1 had distinguished Republicans on it as well as Democrats. I am meeting with Senator Anderson and Senator Javits, and I think that this offers a good deal of hope for that bill. I think they have given it new life.;1 National Committee on Health Care of the Aged (see Item 460 and note).;[13.] Q. Mr. President, part of the disenchantment on Capitol Hill over foreign aid seems to be the feeling that the administration has not fully used the flexibility it asks. For example, on aid to Indonesia, when President Sukarno was threatening Malaysia.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have suspended the aid to Indonesia.;Q. But you have not suspended it, have you, Mr. President, to the United Arab Republic, which is defying the U.N.?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, now, in the case of Indonesia, though, we are suspending it. 2 It seems to me it is much better--I don't know what the situation is going to be 3 months from now in regard to the relations between Indonesia and Malaysia. I hope they are better. But it is the possible use of passing a prohibition for assistance to Indonesia, because of its attitude toward Malaysia when 3 months from now it may or may not be the same as it is today. That's the point.;2 As explained by the State Department immediately following the news conference, the President did not mean that existing aid programs to Indonesia had been suspended. He had in mind the fact that the United States had suspended consideration of a large additional aid program which, until Indonesia's recent actions against Malaysia, was being developed in cooperation with other members of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development;Now on the United Arab Republic, the United States, as you know, 80 percent of its assistance consists of food, surplus food. We have been working to try to get a withdrawal, an orderly withdrawal, in the case of the Yemen. There has not been a conflict--I think a good deal as a result of effort which we and others have made--between Saudi Arabia and the UAR. I am concerned about the Yemen because the rate of the withdrawal, of course, has been quite limited.;There are going to be further withdrawals by January, but unless those withdrawals are consistent with earlier statements. I would think that the chance of increased tension between the UAR and Saudi Arabia would substantially increase. But I don't think that the language that the Senate adopted, which calls upon me to make a finding which is extremely complicated to make, is particularly--strengthens our hands or our flexibility in dealing with the UAR. In fact, it will have the opposite result.;These countries are poor--I am not talking now about the UAR, most of them-these threats that the United States is going to cut off aid is a great temptation to Arabic countries to say, "Cut it off." They are nationalist, they are proud, they are in many cases radical. I don't think threats from Capitol Hill bring the results which are frequently hoped. A quiet work may not bring it. But I think there is a great temptation to say--at the time the Aswan Dam was cut off, that produced--that did not bring the Arab Republic to follow us. It produced the opposite result. I am afraid of these other threats. I think it is a very dangerous, untidy world. But we are going to have to live with it. I think one of the ways to live with it is to permit us to function. If we don't function, the voters will throw us out. But don't make it impossible for us to function by legislative restraints or inadequate appropriations.;[14.] Q. Mr. President, in view of congressional sentiment towards the Alliance for Progress program, is your administration going to make any special effort to persuade the Government of Argentina not to nationalize American-owned oil companies?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as you know, Governor Harriman visited the Argentine, discussed the matter. It is now in negotiation. What we are concerned about is that if action is taken there will be adequate machinery for compensation, fair compensation. We can't deny the sovereign right of a country to take action within its borders, but we can insist that there be equitable standards for compensating those whose property is taken away from them.;We are attempting to work this out with the Argentine, but the Argentine is faced, as are all of the Latin Americans, with staggering problems. They have emerged from a military junta, Peronism, and all of the rest, and democratic election, and this was one of the commitments that was made. So now we attempt to adjust our interests. But we are concerned about the oil in Argentina and in Peru.;[15.] Q. You have been reported as saying you were very satisfied with the vote in Philadelphia. Why were you satisfied?;THE PRESIDENT. Because Mayor Tate was elected. As John Bailey said, the Republicans had the statistics and we, the offices. So that is why I was satisfied.;[16.] Q. Mr. President, the Fred Korth and Bobby Baker cases have prompted some serious questions about the moral and ethical climate in Washington. What is your assessment of today's climate in Washington?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it is always--in the first place I don't lump the two cases together. I think that there are differences between the two cases. I want to make that clear. So there are differences between the cases.;Now, if you are talking about--there are always bound to be in the Government, the newspaper business, labor, and so on, farmers-there are always going to be people who can't stand the pressure of opportunity, so that--but the important point is what action is taken against them.;I think that this administration has been very vigorous in its action, and I think that we have tried to set a responsible standard. There are always going to be people who fail to meet that standard, and we attempt to take appropriate action dealing with each case.;But Mr. Baker is now being investigated, and I think we will know a good deal more about Mr. Baker before we are through. Other people may be investigated as time goes on. We just try to do the best we can. And I think that--the governmental standards, let me say, on the whole I think compare favorably with those in Washington, with those in some other parts of America.;[17.] Q. Mr. President, last week the Soviet Union in Moscow showed what they claimed was an anti-missile missile. I wonder if you could tell us what you know about that missile. Is it what they claim it is supposed to be, and also what is the effectiveness of their anti-missile system?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't think it is probably useful to discuss it in detail here. I don't think there is any doubt that they have an anti-missile missile, as do we. The problem, of course, is what you do with saturation. I don't think that the Soviet Union or the United States have solved the problem of dealing, as I have said before, with a whole arsenal of missiles coming at us at maximum speed, with decoys. That's the impossible. That, up to now, has been an impossible task.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, we seem to be in somewhat of a stalemate on recognizing the new regimes in two Latin American countries, the Dominican Republic and Honduras. I am wondering--the administration perhaps has been reluctant to tell these countries precisely what they had to do to get recognition.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have had discussions with both countries. As you know, this is not just a matter of the United States. This is a matter of nearly the whole hemisphere. In fact, by a vote of 18 to 1, the OAS voted to have a meeting on the problem of military coups.;We have attempted to indicate or inquire what steps each of these two countries, the governments of the two countries, are prepared to take to return to constitutional government, which we regard as the most desirable form of government and also the one that would be most effective in meeting the challenges of the hemisphere. So we have inquired of both of them what steps they are prepared to take, when elections would be, who would be in the government. So we have been working very assiduously.;Q. In general terms, sir, could you say whether we would be prepared to accept the same conditions for recognition there that we did in the case of the junta in Peru, elections within 1 year, for example?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it would be unwise to attempt to negotiate it out here, but we did recognize the junta in Peru on the assurances that they would hold elections. They did hold them and the result was very fair. So it shows that it can be done. That is what we would like to see done in these countries.;[19.] Q. Mr. President, to go back to the Russian-American problem, given the fact that our relations seem to alternate between hot and cold--the Barghoorn case and the autobahn at the moment--what do you say to those Americans who say that in such a situation we should not sell wheat to the Soviet Union, certainly not without trying to use it as a method of, say, negotiating some better arrangement on the autobahn?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the wheat deal is desirable for us. It is desirable for the Soviet Union. I am not convinced--it may mean $200 million in balance of payments for us. It means wheat to the Soviet Union. But in view of the supplies that the Soviet Union has in its own country, in Australia, in Canada, I am not sure that the wheat can carry other loads. I think it pretty much stands on its own. It is of some benefit to us, some benefit to the Soviet Union, but this idea that other things can be hitched onto it--but obviously this kind of trade depends upon a reasonable atmosphere in both countries.;I think that atmosphere has been badly damaged by the Barghoorn arrest. In the case of the autobahn, this is a continuing matter over a good many years. We are going to maintain our rights in Berlin and we have made that quite dear. I expect that we are going to have difficulties, and the Soviet Union may have difficulties in other matters. But Professor Barghoorn I regard as a very serious matter.;[20.] Q. Mr. President, do you feel that you have a firm commitment from the Republicans and the House leadership to back and support in the Rules Committee and on the floor every provision in the compromise bill approved by the House?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't want to speak for them. I think they ought to speak for themselves. I will say that a substantial part of that bill bears Republican language and imprint. It wouldn't have been passed without their support. It is a bill which is Republican and Democratic. I think it is a bill which is bipartisan. I would hope it would have--it can't pass without bipartisan support. I would hope it would be able to maintain it on the floor of the House, because if we don't we are not even going to get it through the House.;[21.] Q. Mr. President, in view of the changed situation in South Viet-Nam, do you still expect to bring back 1,000 troops before the end of the year, or has that figure been raised or lowered?;THE PRESIDENT. No, we are going to bring back several hundred before the end of the year. But I think on the question of the exact number, I thought we would wait until the meeting of November 20th.;[22.] Q. Mr. President, we will soon be getting some distressing news from Sao Paulo in Brazil in relation to the Alliance for Progress. Now the Post had a piece--this morning--saying that an idea has been circulated by which the Alliance would be made worldwide with the participation of Eastern European countries and the Soviet Union in this to help the Alliance reach its goals. Can you tell us in principle what you think about it?;THE PRESIDENT, No, I have never heard of that, and we are not proposing to engage in a joint effort with the Eastern Europeans. That is a matter, of course, of sovereign decision. But I don't regard them as interested at all in the Alliance because the Alliance and the charter of Punta del Este is based upon the development of free, democratic societies in Latin America, which is our objective. Their objective, of course, is different. So I don't see how you can join them in the Alliance.;[23.] Q. Mr. President, several months ago you nominated David Rabinovitz to be a Federal judge in western Wisconsin. Since that time the American Bar Association has opposed this nomination and a majority of lawyers polled by the State Bar Association said that he was unqualified. Do you still support this nomination, or in view of this opposition are you going to withdraw?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I am for David Rabinovitz all the way. I know him very well, in fact for a number of years. And the American Bar Association has been very helpful in making the judgment, but I am sure they would agree that they are not infallible. Mr. Brandeis was very much opposed. There are a good many judges who have been opposed who have been rather distinguished. And I am for David Rabinovitz.;[24.] Q. Sir, do you mean to leave the implication by your remarks on the wheat thing that if the Barghoorn case is not satisfactory;THE PRESIDENT. NO, I wouldn't attempt to. I want to get Professor Barghoorn out of prison and it seems to me the best way to do it is to confine my remarks to what I have said. I am merely saying--in fact, I won't say it--any more!;[25.] Q. Mr. President, the Senators from New England met this morning in the office of Senator Kennedy and agreed to renew their annual appeal for relief on wool and for the lifting of restrictions on residual oil. What can you do and what will you do to help the people in New England on these problems?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as I understand it, on one case there is a desire to limit imports and the other is to encourage imports. I used to take part in those meetings myself.;On the other hand--and there is a matter of concern--as a matter of fact, yesterday I met with the head of the coal producers-the coal association--they're very concerned about the imports of residual oil. But it is a fact that the imports of woolens and worsteds have gone up from about 15 to 22 or 23 percent. So there has been a sharp increase, and it is a matter of concern. In the case of residual, we are attempting to--that is a matter of great interest, as you know, to Venezuela, which is a country that is under Communist attack and, therefore, we have to consider that obligation as well as our obligations to the domestic coal industry. So we have not forgotten New England.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">January 23, 1964</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. [1.] I want to take this opportunity to restate our position on Panama and the Canal Zone. No purpose is served by rehashing either recent or ancient events. There have been excesses and errors on the part of both Americans and Panamanians. Earlier this month, actions of imprudent students from both countries played into the hands of agitators seeking to divide us. What followed was a needless and tragic loss of life on both sides. 1;1 In defiance of an order of the Governor of Panama to eliminate the flying of flags at schools, American students on January 7 hoisted their own flag at Balboa High School. Two days later Panamanian students attempted to display their flag and disorder followed. On January 10 Panama broke diplomatic relations with the United States. (See also Items 95, 104, 114.;Our own forces were confronted with sniper fire and mob attack. Their role was one of resisting aggression and not committing it. At all times they remained inside the Canal Zone and they took only those defensive actions required to maintain law and order and to protect lives and property and the Canal itself. Our obligation to safeguard the Canal against riots and vandals and sabotage and other interference rests on the precepts of international law, the requirements of international commerce, and the needs of free world security.;These obligations cannot be abandoned. But the security of the Panama Canal is not inconsistent with the interests of the Republic of Panama. Both of these objectives can and should be assured by the actions and the agreement of Panama and the United States. This Government has long recognized that our operation of the Canal across Panama poses special problems for both countries. It is necessary, therefore, that our relations be given constant attention.;Over the past few years we have taken a number of actions to remove inequities and irritants. We recognize that there are things to be done and we are prepared to talk about the ways and means of doing them. But violence is never justified and is never a basis for talks. Consequently, the first item of business has been the restoration of public order. The Inter-American Peace Committee, which I met this morning, deserves the thanks of us all, not only for helping to restore order, but for its good offices. 2 For the future, we have stated our willingness to engage without limitation or delay in a full and frank review and reconsideration of all issues between our two countries.;2 The Inter-American Peace Committee of the Organization of American States, composed of Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, the United States (in connection with this matter the OAS Council elected Chile to serve in place of the United States), and Venezuela, was called upon jointly by the two countries to study the U.S.-Panamanian dispute and to recommend measures for its settlement.;We have set no preconditions to the resumption of peaceful discussions. We are bound by no preconceptions of what they will produce. And we hope that Panama can take the same approach. In the meantime, we expect neither country to either foster or yield to any kind of pressure with respect to such discussions. We are prepared, 30 days after relations are restored, to sit in conference with Panamanian officials to seek concrete solutions to all problems dividing our countries. Each government will be free to raise any issue and to take any position. And our Government will consider all practical solutions to practical problems that are offered in good faith.;Certainly solutions can be found which are compatible with the dignity and the security of both countries, as well as the needs of world commerce. And certainly Panama and the United States can remain, as they should remain, good friends and good neighbors.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, before you go, I wonder if you could entertain another question or so. For example, how do you think things are going up on the Hill?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we signed the cultural bill this morning. We finished up the appropriation bill before we went home Christmas. We completed the education bills that were then in conference, and signed them.;We had two big items that are high on the agenda, the civil rights bill.;We have the feeling and the belief of the leadership that we will have that bill before the House early in the month and that we will have final action on it before they take a holiday for Lincoln's Birthday.;On the tax bill, Senator Byrd has called me within the hour and told me that they reversed the decision earlier made and today they took the language out, all repeal language, dealing with excises and restored $450 million in the bill by a 9 to 8 vote and then reported the bill to the Senate by a vote of 12 to 5.;[3.] You are also writing some other stories, I think, about an insurance policy that was written on my life some 7 years ago, and I am still here.;The company in which Mrs. Johnson and my daughters have a majority interest, along with some other stockholders, were somewhat concerned when I had a heart attack in 1955, and in 1957 they purchased insurance on my life made payable to the company. And the insurance premiums were never included as a business expense, but they thought that was good business practice in case something happened to me, so Mrs. Johnson and the children wouldn't have to sell their stock on the open market and lose control of the company.;That insurance was purchased here in Washington, and on a portion of the premiums paid, Mr. Don Reynolds got a small commission. Mr. George Sampson, the general agent for the Manhattan Insurance Company, handled it and we have paid some $78,000 in premiums up to date and there is another $11,800 due next month which the company will probably pay to take care of that insurance.;[4.] There is a question also which has been raised about a gift of a stereo set that an employee of mine made to me and Mrs. Johnson. That happened some 2 years later, some 5 years ago. The Baker family gave us a stereo set. We used it for a period, and we had exchanged gifts before. He was an employee of the public and had no business pending before me and was asking for nothing, and so far as I knew expected nothing in return any more than I did when I had presented him with gifts.;I think that is about all I know that is going on on the Hill, but I hope that covers it rather fully. That is all I have to say about it and all I know about it.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, sir.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">February 1, 1964</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT [1.] This past week the United States has demonstrated anew in at least eight different situations this Nation's determination to insure both peace and freedom in the widest possible areas. Progress toward these ends is frequently slow and rarely dramatic, but it should be viewed in the perspective of history and not headlines.;First, we have been patiently continuing our efforts to resume relations with our neighbors in Panama, and to reconsider with them, without preconditions on either side, all issues which threaten to divide us.;Second, we have been quietly working on the Cyprus crisis with our friends, to determine the most useful role that each of us can play in easing the present strains on the island.;Third, in response to my request, I have received assurances from the new and friendly leaders of Viet-Nam that they are proceeding immediately to step up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong, with specific instructions to the corps commanders and a personal visit by General Khanh to the vital delta area.;Fourth, we have been consulting with all parties concerned in the Indonesian-Malaysian dispute, including the United Nations, to follow up on the Attorney General's successful efforts in arranging for a cease-fire and a discussion at the conference table.;Fifth, we have been in constant consultation with our allies regarding the troubled course of independence in several East African states where we can hardly expect to control events, but we can help these nations preserve their freedom from foreign domination.;Sixth, we have been confronted with the brutal shooting down of an unarmed American plane off course in East Germany, and the necessity for preventing further incidents of this kind.;Seventh, in view of the french recognition of Red China, we have been discussing with the free nations of Asia the necessity of resisting any further temptations to reward the Peking regime for its defiance of world peace and order.;And finally, we have witnessed and the whole world has witnessed with pleasure the remarkable success of our Saturn rocket, the most powerful rocket thrust known to man. This rocket, I am happy to say, was first recommended by our committee in 1958. It is not our desire or in our interest to create an air of emergency about these or other events. Our work proceeds both day and night, quietly, steadily, I believe confidently, and I think the American people have every reason to share in that confidence.;[2.] I have a few announcements to make in the defense area. first, I am gratified by the results from the letters to defense contractors 1 that I sent out less than a month ago. We have received almost 800 replies to that letter. The Defense Department has talked with many businessmen directly. This is going to be an important part of the effort which we believe is going to produce savings to the taxpayers of over $4 billion per year in fiscal 1967. 2;1 See Item 18.;2 The savings to be effected by the Department of Defense, the White House announced on January 27, would be the result of a "vigorous program" to shift from contracting on a cost-plus-fixed fee basis to fixed price or incentive contracts, and of reducing the number of letter contracts, preliminary agreements under which contractors may start work before a price is agreed on.;Second, I want to draw your attention today to the cost reduction section of the Defense Department budget statement which was released last week. Some figures in there should be of interest to every taxpayer. Next year's Defense budget, the one just sent up for fiscal 1965, includes, due to more efficient management of our defenses, $2 4/10 billion. That is more than $10 for every man, woman, and child in our country. That has come about because of more efficient management under Mr. McNamara and the men who serve with him.;That is money that is strictly saved in the coming fiscal year simply by following more sensible and efficient procedures. It is money saved not by risking this country's security, not by cutting our defenses, but by running the Department on a sound and businesslike basis, and with real unification. I have seen more unification present and achieved in the Defense Department than at any time since the Department was created.;[3.] We are, in fact, constantly making improvements in our strategic missile arsenal. We are improving the payloads, the accuracies, the reliability of all of these weapons. We are also adding new weapons to our arsenal. We are now completing development, for example, on three new and highly advanced weapons systems.;I think you would like to hear something about this, because you can take great pride in it. first, the first of these is the Redeye. for the first time our ground combat soldier will be able to fight back against a high performance enemy aircraft. The Redeye, which he can fire from the shoulder like a rifle, sends a heat-seeking missile in pursuit of the enemy airplane, with a very high probability of scoring. Once hit, the airplane will go down. Redeye has been developed by the Pomona Division of General Dynamics at Pomona, Calif.;Second, the Shillelagh has successfully completed engineering tests and is being released for production. It is an antitank missile mounted on a vehicle so light that we can parachute it into the battlefield, and so accurate that it can destroy a tank at a range of several thousand yards.;And finally, the Navy has recently demonstrated the Walleye, a glide bomb to be launched from an airplane and guided to its target by television. The bomb has a television camera which is focused through remote control by the pilot in the airplane. Once the pilot has focused the camera on the target, the mechanism in the bomb takes over, watches the television screen inside the bomb, and then guides it until it reaches the target.;The Walleye has been demonstrated and it has shown amazing accuracy at a range of several miles. It is being developed by the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, Calif., where the now famous Sidewinder missile was developed.;[4.] finally, I conferred at length yesterday with Sargent Shriver, who has just returned from a world trip, and I have asked him to serve as Special Assistant to the President in the organization and the ado ministration of the war on poverty program which I announced in my State of the Union Message.;Mr. Shriver will continue to serve as Director of the Peace Corps. He will begin immediately to study the formulation and the execution of the concentrated assault on the causes and cures of poverty in the United States. I expect to appoint a committee of the Cabinet to serve in an advisory capacity with him, a Cabinet committee to be made up of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Labor, the Attorney General, the various departments, that would be Interior and Agriculture, that would be concerned with our war on poverty.;Mr. Shriver is eminently qualified for this additional assignment. As you know, he is Executive Director of the Joseph P. Kennedy foundation, he was President of the Chicago School Board, he is a very successful businessman. He is an organizer and Director of the Peace Corps. He has demonstrated outstanding qualities of leadership, and I am sure that we will find that in the organization and draft of the message as well as the administration of the poverty program, if it is approved by Congress, we will find him an exceptionally well-qualified employee.;[5.] Now I would like to conclude by reading a brief message that I have just sent to General Khanh in Viet-Nam, in which I say;I am glad to know that we see eye to eye on the necessity of stepping up the pace of military operations against the Viet Cong. I particularly appreciate your warm and immediate response to my message as conveyed by Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins. We shall continue to be available to help you to carry the war to the enemy, and to increase the confidence of the Vietnamese people in their government.;A couple of days ago I sent General Khanh a message urging him to step up the pace of military operations. He immediately replied, as I announced in my more formal statement, and this is my personal, longhand reply to the General.;Now, any questions?;[6.] Q. Mr. President, do you foresee a situation in the relatively near future where you might recommend or accept the admission of Red China into the United Nations?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I do not.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, sir, I wonder what you think about a full-time Senate employee, or an employee of any Government agency, who would get himself involved on off-duty hours or in regular hours with consultants for defense contracting firms of the Government, with building motels, getting himself involved in deals with mortgage companies that are interested in pending legislation, and in visiting the Dominican Republic and talking to them about buying U.S. fighter planes by way of Sweden? Do you think this is the proper conduct for any Government employee?;THE PRESIDENT. The Senate committee is now making a study of the accuracy of some of the allegations that you have made. They will, in their wisdom, determine the accuracy of those allegations and, I am sure, render proper judgment.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, many of us are wondering why you would hold a news conference in a cramped little room such as this, limited to about 90 newsmen, when you have facilities available to accommodate all newsmen, such as at the State Department?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't have an answer to that question of yours. I thought that this would be ample to take care of your needs. I am sorry if you find yourselves uncomfortable. It was much more convenient to come here at the time that I could come, and I was attempting to satisfy the newsmen. It is somewhat difficult to do sometimes, but they wanted a news conference this week, and I thought this was the appropriate place and could be best handled here.;[9.] Q. Mr. President, although it seems a little early, as a result of the Republican fund-raising dinners on Friday night they apparently consider it open season on you. Do you have any favorite opponent among the ones mentioned prominently to run against you next term, and do you think it will be a hands-off, pretty rough political type campaign between you and that opponent?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't have any favorite opponent. It is not my duty to select my opposition. I think that the delegates to the Republican Convention will act wisely and select the best man that is available to them. And so far as I am concerned, I hope to keep as free from politics as I can, as long as I can, because I think it is in the interest of the continuity and transition of this administration and the unity of the country to keep free from mudslinging and petty politics and getting into any political battles.;I have asked the Democrats to refrain from indulging in any personalities if at all possible. We will have debates about principles and we expect differences of opinion. We don't want to suppress them or silence them. But I found in the 8 years that I served as Democratic Leader under President Eisenhower that it was not necessary to sling mud or to indulge in personalities, and I hope that our Democratic people will follow that course. What the Republicans do is a matter for them to determine in their wisdom.;[10.] Q. Mr. President, you spoke of viewing these foreign problems in the perspective of history rather than today's headlines. Looking at the problem of Viet-Nam that way, how do you look, what do you see down the road? Is this a situation that can be settled in a military way? Do you rule out any neutralization such as General de Gaulle suggests, or what is your general perspective on Viet-Nam?;THE PRESIDENT. If we could have neutralization of both North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam, I am sure that would be considered sympathetically. But I see no indication of that at the moment. I think that if we could expect the Viet Cong to let their neighbors live in peace, we could take a much different attitude. But as long as these raids are continuing and people are attempting to envelop South Viet-Nam, I think that the present course we are conducting is the only answer to that course, and I think that the operations should be stepped up there. I see no sentiment favoring neutralization of South Viet-Nam alone, and I think the course that we are following is the most advisable one for freedom at this point.;[11.] Q. Mr. President, can you give us some idea of how you expect to participate in the choice of your own running mate, whether you will make your personal choice known to the convention, and what some of the factors are that you would weigh in the selection?;THE PRESIDENT. I would think that it would be premature and somewhat presumptuous at this point for me to go into any detailed discussion on the selection of a Vice President. I think that if I am nominated by the convention, selected as their standard bearer, my recommendations will likely be sought, and if so, I will be glad to give them. And at that time I will cross that bridge. I hope that I can act wisely and in the best interests of the American people.;[12.] Q. Mr. President, have you had the opportunity yet to study and make a personal decision on the rather bitter debate, dispute, rather, between Secretary McNamara and the joint Atomic Committee in the Congress over the atomic power plant for the carrier?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I feel that I have not gone into the details of the fight. I am aware of the issue. I concur in the judgment that Secretary McNamara has made. I think that we are looking far into the future and that those judgments are always susceptible to error. But at this moment I would conclude that his decision has been a reasonable one and a fair one and one in which I agree.;[13] Q. Mr. President, a two-part question on legislation: How confident are you that your two main pieces of legislation of top priority, namely, the tax cut and civil rights, are actually going ahead to become legislation that is satisfactory to you, and secondly, what are the pieces of legislation beneath those that you consider of importance as well? for instance, is medical care virtually in the same order of priority?;THE PRESIDENT. The answer to your first question is that I think that in the 60 days that I have held this office we have made great progress in legislation. When I came into it, we had gone along down the road with our educational bills, but we finally consummated them, and I think we have the best educational Congress in the history of the Republic.;We had 5 or 6 appropriations bills out of 15 passed. We concluded action on those during this period of time. We have reported the civil rights bill from the Rules Committee, and it is now being debated in the House. I hope and I believe that it will be passed without any crippling amendments. I think it should be passed without any crippling amendments. I think that due progress is being made there. I hope it is acted upon in the House before the Members leave to attend Lincoln Day birthday meetings throughout the Nation, because it would be a great tribute to President Lincoln to have that bill finally acted upon in the House before we go out to celebrate his birthday.;On the tax bill, it has been before the Congress now for almost 13 months. The Senate has reported it, the Senate committee has reported it to the Senate. It is being debated there. There are some 180-odd technical amendments and there will be dozens of other amendments. It will be carefully deliberated, but I hope that we can pass it before we take a recess for Lincoln's Birthday on February 12.;I am pleased with the progress made on both of those bills. I hope the tax bill can withstand the onslaughts that will be made by many in attempting to amend it in the next few days, and then will go to conference. And I would like to see it reported from conference as nearly to the administration's recommendations as possible, because before those recommendations were submitted to Congress, I participated in their formulation and embraced them.;Now, there are other important items. We have a good many items in the national resource legislation field, like the wilderness bill and others. We have a good many measures we must pass in the agricultural field, farm legislation, which we consider very important. We consider medical care a very important measure, and I have already talked to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee about it. I have talked to leading Republicans who have a substitute plan that they have proposed, which I am now studying and giving some thought to, trying to determine the merits of it. But I hope that we can pass a medicare bill out of the House Ways and Means Committee and through the Congress this year based on the social security principle. I can think of no single piece of legislation that I would be ha?pier to approve than that bill.;The housing legislation--I could spend most of this time telling you how important I think it is. It is one of the most comprehensive bills in the history of the Nation. I hope that we can work toward the goal of someday every American owning his home. I think that this message goes in that direction. I have reviewed it carefully, both at the ranch and here in Washington, with Administrator Weaver. We will start hearings on it very shortly in both bodies. It is extremely important.;I think that we have an administration program that is going to be difficult to enact before the conventions, but with cooperation from all people on both sides of the aisle I hope we will attain a major part of it.;To your second question, I would say that I do put medical care high on the priority list.;[14.] Q. Mr. President, does General de Gaulle's proposal for neutralizing Southeast Asia interfere with our objectives there or make our work there more difficult than it would be otherwise?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I do not agree with General de Gaulle's proposals. I do not think that it would be in the interest of freedom to share his view. General de Gaulle is entitled to his opinion. He has expressed it. We have expressed ours. We think the course of action that we are following in Southeast Asia is the only course for us to follow, and the most advisable at this time. We plan to pursue it diligently and, we hope, successfully on a stepped-up basis.;[15.] Q. Mr. President, 2 days ago, when Prime Minister Pearson of Canada was in Washington, he expressed the position that before long Russia would agree to a total nuclear test ban to include underground tests. Do you share this optimism? And, also, are you optimistic that some meaningful disarmament agreements will come out of the present Geneva conference?;THE PRESIDENT. I would rather not express it in terms of optimism or pessimism. I would rather say that it should be the goal of every leader in the world today to try to find areas of agreement that will lead to disarmament. We are seriously, dedicatedly, doing our very best and trying to initiate and develop every conceivable fresh proposal we can that will lead to that end.;[16.] Q. Mr. President, do you anticipate a filibuster when the civil rights bill eventually reaches the Senate? Do you think in order to pass it in the Senate the bill will have to be substantially trimmed?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I do not think it will have to be substantially trimmed. And yes, I do expect a filibuster.;Q. Mr. President, Thursday in the Rules Committee an amendment was offered to include women in the ban on discrimination in the civil rights bill on the basis of race, religion, or national origin. That was defeated by one vote and will be brought up again on the floor of the House.;Now, in the Democratic platform it says-and if I may read you just a few words-"We support legislation which will guarantee to women equality of rights under the law.;Would you support an amendment to include women in the civil rights bill?;THE PRESIDENT. I supported that platform and embraced that platform, and stated that view in 43 States in the Union. I realize there has been discrimination in the employment of women, and I am doing my best to do something about it. I am hopeful that in the next month we will have made substantial advances in that field.;[17.] Q. Mr. President, do you feel that Mr. Walter Jenkins should go up to the Capitol and testify under oath to clear up the conflicts that are appearing in the testimony?;THE PRESIDENT. The general question was raised with me at my last meeting. I spoke with candor and frankness on that subject, about all I knew about it. I said then that I did not plan to make any more statements on it, and I do not.;[18.] Q. Mr. President, could you elaborate, sir, on your statement that you might look with some sympathy on the neutralization of both South Viet-Nam and North Viet-Nam? How does this differ from President de Gaulle's idea?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, you will have to ask General de Gaulle about the details of his proposal. But as I understand it, the neutralization talk has applied only to South Viet-Nam and not to the whole of that area of the world. I think that the only thing we need to do to have complete peace in that area of the world now is to stop the invasion of South Viet-Nam by some of its neighbors and supporters.;[19.] Q. Mr. President, some of your advisers have different views as to the proper strategy to follow in the war on poverty. Some think the program should emphasize a welfare aspect, some think an education aspect, some think job creation. Which of those three general areas do you think the program should focus on?;THE PRESIDENT. On all three of them. And I am unaware of any differences among my advisers in that field. We have a group from the Cabinet that has given considerable attention to that and we are now developing recommendations. Those recommendations will be contained in a message.;But my answer to your question is, first, I know of no disagreement among my advisers, two, I think the message will emphasize all three areas. That message is being very carefully worked out and will be coordinated with all of the advisers who have responsibilities in those fields. We expect to get through the regular appropriations bills in excess of a half billion dollars to be coordinated into the poverty program so that it will be essential that we have the cooperation of all the Cabinet departments to whom the money is appropriated.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House on the Peace Corps.</td><td class="c6">February 26, 1965</td><td class="c7">[ Released February 26, 1965. Dated February 25, 1965 ];Dear Mr. President: (Dear Mr. Speaker:);It is my pleasure to transmit legislation to authorize the appropriation of $125.2 million for the Peace Corps in Fiscal Year 1966.;The Peace Corps will, in a few days, reach its fourth anniversary. Since its beginning, on March 1, 1961, the Peace Corps has justified the highest hopes of those who established it. The Congress intended that this new agency would help peoples of interested countries and areas "in meeting their needs for trained manpower, and to help promote a better understanding of the American people on the part of the peoples served and a better understanding of other peoples on the part of the American people.;In the early days, the Peace Corps was portrayed by many at home and abroad as an attractive, ever gallant gesture, a token of good will, and the symbol of a friendly America. But the Peace Corps' success has proven to be deeper. The Peace Corps has a fundamental role abroad above and beyond its symbolic value.;A Peace Corps, 10,000 strong, has been working in 46 countries. Volunteers are now in more than 3,000 different locations around the world. In the countryside of the developing world, the most frequently encountered American is a Peace Corps volunteer. In several nations, there are more volunteers than individuals from all other American agencies and services combined.;Our Peace Corps has become important to the worldwide process of developing human resources in building nations. It is helping nations, not by preaching, but by doing, not by words, but by work.;In Africa, the Peace Corps has made an impressive contribution to secondary education. In six African nations, our volunteers make up at least one-third of the degree-holding teachers, they represent 90 per cent of the degree-holding teachers in Malawi, they reach 50,000 Nigerian students each day. In these and other African countries, they have contributed to a great expansion of the school systems--to an increase of tens of thousands of secondary school students.;In India, Peace Corps volunteers are working with Indians to introduce modern commercial poultry production involving improved breeds, poultry care, feeding and marketing development. Production of eggs and poultry has increased manyfold and these new approaches, at present, are being adopted in new areas of the country.;More than 3,700 volunteers in Latin America are engaged in a continental effort in community development, helping to bring the citizens and governments of 17 nations together in self-help programs.;Community development does not produce dramatic statistics. But it does change people, and people change nations.;This essential ingredient of progress--the expansion of the will and capacity of man-is hard to achieve and more difficult to measure. It is, nonetheless, basic to development. One encouraging measurement of Peace Corps success in this field has been the emergence of responsive, effective community-development agencies in many Latin American countries. In Colombia, the Government's fledgling agency, "Accion Communal", which had only a limited plan when the first volunteers arrived in 1961, is now firmly established. It is operating vigorous and effective programs in both isolated rural areas and urban slums. In Peru and Bolivia, volunteers are helping to train personnel for those countries' newly organized development agencies. In the Dominican Republic, the Peace Corps was the energizing force behind that country's "Desarrollo Comunidad". Peace Corps participation in El Salvador's "Educational Brigades" has expanded that program from three experimental areas to 18, covering most of that small but significant country.;The task is indeed vast. But in the Peace Corps, we have found a practical way in which Americans--personally, directly, effectively--can play a valuable part. And in doing so, they are encouraging other peoples to mobilize themselves. Over 1,200 university students are now working in the villages of the Andean highlands in a student Peace Corps, known as Cooperacion Popular Universitaria. In Chile, 1,500 students are using their vacations to build schools. India is planning a Development Corps of 5,000 to 10,000 organized along Peace Corps lines. In Thailand, the Voluntary Rural Development Corps awaits final Cabinet approval before beginning its work.;So the Peace Corps can no longer be viewed as just a feather in our Nation's cap. It is an essential part of our democratic program in meeting our world responsibilities and opportunities. It has become a major instrument for economic and social development. And in learning about nation-building, it is providing a corps of dedicated and experienced Americans who, upon their return, will help us continue to strengthen this Nation at home.;The urgent yet prudent requests from host countries for volunteers are growing. There is ample justification and great need to satisfy these requests. To meet these needs we must utilize in the Peace Corps the talents, energy, and enthusiasm of all interested and capable citizens who volunteer in such large numbers.;The requested Peace Corps authorization for Fiscal Year 1966 is an increase of $21.1 million over the amount appropriated by the Congress for Fiscal Year 1965. This increase will enable the Peace Corps to expand from a level of 15,000 by the end of August 1965, to 17,000 volunteers by the end of August 1966.;It is my belief, therefore, that a growing Peace Corps of increasing capabilities and effectiveness is essential. Our responsibilities to ourselves, to our Country, and to the world require no less.;Sincerely;LYNDON B. JOHNSON</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">April 27, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. [1.] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am glad to see that you are willing to trade your new comfort in the West Lobby for these straight-backed chairs in the East Room.;Today I have somewhat of a conflict of emotions. I wanted to give you due and adequate 3-day notice of a press conference, and at the same time I didn't want to manage the news by holding up the announcement of some appointees I have here today, so we have tried to reconcile the two, and a little later in the statement I want to present to you some men that over the weekend I selected to occupy some important posts in Government.;VIET-NAM [2.] We are engaged in a crucial struggle in Viet-Nam. Some may consider it a small war, but to the men who give their lives it is the last war and the stakes are high. Independent South Viet-Nam has been attacked by North Viet-Nam. The object of that attack is total conquest. Defeat in South Viet-Nam would deliver a friendly nation to terror and repression. It would encourage and spur on those who seek to conquer all free nations that are within their reach.;Our own welfare, our own freedom, would be in great danger. This is the clearest lesson of our time. From Munich until today we have learned that to yield to aggression brings only greater threats and brings even more destructive war. To stand firm is the only guarantee of a lasting peace. At every step of the way, we have used our great power with the utmost restraint. We have made every effort possible to find a peaceful solution. We have done this in the face of the most outrageous and brutal provocation against Vietnamese and against Americans alike.;Through the first 7 months of 1964, both Vietnamese and Americans were the targets of constant attacks of terror. Bombs exploded in helpless villages, in downtown movie theaters, even at the sports fields where the children played. Soldiers and civilians, men and women, were murdered and crippled, yet we took no action against the source of this brutality--North Viet-Nam.;When our destroyers were attacked in the Gulf of Tonkin, as you will remember last summer, we replied promptly with a single raid. The punishment then was limited to the deed. For the next 6 months we took no action against North Viet-Nam. We warned of danger, we hoped for caution in others.;Their answer was attack, and explosions, and indiscriminate murder. So it soon became clear that our restraint was viewed as weakness, our desire to limit conflict was viewed as a prelude to our surrender.;We could no longer stand by while attacks mounted and while the bases of the attackers were immune from reply. Therefore, we began to strike back. But America has not changed her essential position, and that purpose is peaceful settlement. That purpose is to resist aggression. That purpose is to avoid a wider war.;I say again that I will talk to any government, anywhere, any time, without any conditions, and if any doubt our sincerity, let them test us. Each time we have met with silence, or slander, or the sound of guns. But just as we will not flag in battle, we will not weary in the search for peace.;So I reaffirm my offer of unconditional discussions.;We will discuss any subject and any point of view with any government concerned.;This offer may be rejected, as it has been in the past, but it will remain open, waiting for the day when it becomes clear to all that armed attack will not yield domination over others.;And I will continue along the course that we have set: firmness with moderation, readiness for peace with refusal to retreat. For this is the same battle which we fought for a generation. Wherever we have stood firm, aggression has been halted, peace has been restored, and liberty has been maintained. This was true under President Truman, under President Eisenhower, under President Kennedy, and it will be true again in southeast Asia.;THE STEEL AGREEMENT [3.] I want to go now to another subject. I want to congratulate the negotiators for the steel companies and the United Steelworkers union on the statesmanlike agreement that they reached yesterday to extend their contract. I hope and I expect that it will be approved by the union's committee tomorrow. While the settlement reached in steel is only an interim one, I think we can be confident that the final settlement will be a responsible one which fully considers not only the interest of the immediate parties, but also the larger public interest.;1965 WAGE-PRICE STABILITY [4.] So far in 1965 our record of wage-price stability remains intact. A survey of the wage increases on more than 600 collective bargainings settled so far this year shows that on the average the percentage increases were unchanged from the moderate increases agreed on in the same period last year. A number of important settlements were at approximately the level of our guideposts, and this record of private actions is most encouraging.;Today I can report to you and to the Nation that our expanding economy will produce higher Federal revenues this year than we estimated to Congress in January. I can also report that our continuing drive to hold down Government spending will produce lower expenditures this year than we estimated to Congress in January. As a result, we expect the actual budget deficit for fiscal 1965 to be at least $1 billion below the $6,300 million estimated last January when we sent our budget to Congress.;Our expenditures, therefore, will be decreased by approximately $500 million under our estimate, and the revenues collected will be increased by approximately $500 million over our estimates.;NEW JOB CORPS CONSERVATION CAMPS [5.] I am pleased also to announce today that the war on poverty is setting up 10 new Job Corps conservation camps in nine States. They will bring to 87 the number of centers that provide skills and education to our youngsters who are out of school and out of work. These new centers will be located in the States of Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, and Washington.;ANNOUNCEMENT OF APPOINTMENTS [6.] Today I would like to introduce to you some gentlemen that I intend to nominate for new assignments in this administration. First, Mr. Alan Boyd. He is 42 years of age, Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, a distinguished lawyer, and a very competent public servant. Mr. Boyd will become Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation, the Senate being willing. 1;1 The Senate confirmed the nomination on May 25, 1965.;Mr. Warren Wiggins. Mr. Wiggins is 42 years old, with a master's degree in public administration from Harvard. In 1962 he was chosen one of the 10 outstanding men in the Federal Government. He has been with the Peace Corps since 1961. Today I am nominating him as Deputy Director of the Peace Corps.;Dr. John A. Schnittker. He is 41 years old, with a Ph.D. from Iowa State University. He is one of the Nation's outstanding farm authorities. He has been Director of Agricultural Economics with the Department of Agriculture. Today I am nominating him to become Under Secretary of Agriculture.;Mr. Charles S. Murphy. This judicious and able man has served in Government for 21 years under four Presidents. He was President Truman's Special Counsel in the White House. He has performed with out-standing quality as Under Secretary of Agriculture. Today I am nominating him to become Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.;Gen. William F. McKee. He is a 4-star general who was Vice Chief of the Air Force and on retirement became special assistant to the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Secretary McNamara has called him one of the most knowledgeable and competent administrators in the Defense Department, with skills in research and development, administration, procurement, and logistics. Today I am nominating him to be the new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency.;Mr. Wilbur J. Cohen. Mr. Cohen is a dedicated career public servant who has served the Government for 26 years as a full-time civil servant and another 5 years as a consultant. Since 1961 he has been an Assistant Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Today I am nominating him for a promotion to become Under Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.;Mr. Donald F. Turner. Mr. Turner is 44 years old, a Phi Beta Kappa from Northwestern University. He has a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, and a law degree from Yale. He has been a law clerk to a Supreme Court Justice and is widely and favorably known throughout the Nation for his work and his writing in the antitrust legal field. He is currently a visiting law professor at Stanford University in California. Today I am nominating him to become Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division.;Mr. Leonard C. Meeker. He is a career attorney with 25 years of Government service. He is a Phi Beta Kappa from Amherst College. Since 1961 he has served as Deputy Legal Adviser in the State Department.;Today I am nominating him to become Legal Adviser in the State Department.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [7.] We are all very much concerned about the serious situation which has developed in the last few hours in the Dominican Republic. Fighting has occurred among different elements of the Dominican armed forces and other groups. Public order in the capital at Santo Domingo has broken down. Due to the gravity of the situation, and the possible danger to the lives of American citizens in the Dominican Republic, I ordered the evacuation of those who wish to leave. As you know, the evacuation is now proceeding.;My latest information is that 1,000 Americans have already been taken aboard ships of the U.S. Navy off the port of Haina, 8 miles west of Santo Domingo. We profoundly deplore the violence and disorder in the Dominican Republic. The situation is grave, and we are following the developments very closely. It is our hope that order can promptly be restored, and that a peaceful settlement of the internal problems can be found.;DEATH OF EDWARD R. MURROW [8.] I have just received the sad news of the passing of Edward R. Murrow. It came to me just a little while ago. I believe that all of us feel a deep sense of loss. We who knew him knew that he was a gallant fighter, a man who dedicated his life both as a newsman and as a public official to an unrelenting search for truth. He subscribed to the proposition that free men and free inquiry are inseparable. He built his life on that unbreakable truth. We have all lost a friend.;I will be glad to take any questions now.;QUESTIONS;DISCUSSION ON VIET-NAM [9.] Q. Mr. President, do you think any of the participants in the national discussion on Viet-Nam could appropriately be likened to the appeasers of 25 or 30 years ago?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't believe in characterizing people with labels. I think you do a great disservice when you engage in name calling. We want honest, forthright discussion in this country, and that will be discussion with differences of views, and we welcome what our friends have to say, whether they agree with us or not. I would not want to label people who agree with me or disagree with me.;THE INDIA-PAKISTAN CONFLICT [10.] Q. Mr. President, can you tell us your reaction or any information you have on the reports of seemingly intensified fighting between the Indians and the forces of Pakio start, and could this possibly relate or have an effect on the fighting in Viet-Nam?;THE PRESIDENT. We deplore fighting wherever it takes place. We have been in dose touch with the situation there. We are very hopeful that ways and means can be found to avoid conflict between these two friends of our country. I talked to Secretary Rusk about it within the hour, and we are anxious to do anything and everything that we can do to see that peace is restored in that area and conflict is ended.;SOVIET NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT PROPOSAL [11.] Q. Mr. President, today the Soviet Union agreed to a French proposal for a 5-power nuclear disarmament conference which would include Communist China as a nuclear power. What would be your attitude to this proposal, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. I have not studied the proposal and was not familiar with the fact that it had been made.;REACTIONS TO JOHNS HOPKINS ADDRESS [12.] Q. Mr. President, the only formal answer so far to your Baltimore speech 2 was that by the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong, who offered a 4-point formula which he suggested was a possible basis for negotiations. My question is, do you regard the 4 points as so unacceptable as to be a complete rejection of your offer to begin discussions, or are there portions of the 4 points which interest you and which you might be willing to discuss?;2 Item 172. [ APP Note: Address at Johns Hopkins University: "Peace Without Conquest." April 7, 1965. ];THE PRESIDENT. I think it was very evident from the Baltimore speech that most of the non-Communist countries in the world welcomed the proposal in that speech, and most of the Communist countries found objections with it. I am very hopeful that some ways and means can be found to bring the parties who are interested in southeast Asia to a conference table. Just what those ways and means will be, I do not know. But every day we explore to the limit of our capacity every possible political and diplomatic move that would bring that about.;USE OF CHINESE VOLUNTEERS Q. Mr. President, I wonder, sir, if you could evaluate for us the threat that has been posed by Red China to send volunteers into Viet-Nam if we escalate the war further?;THE PRESIDENT. We have read their statements from time to time, and the statements of other powers about what they propose 2 Item 172. to do. We are in close touch with the situation. That is all I think I would like to say on that matter.;THE WAR ON POVERTY [13.] Q. Mr. President, there has been some criticism at the local level in this country of your war on poverty, and one of the chief complaints is that the local community action groups do not represent the poor. Have you found any basis for this criticism, and do you feel that criticism such as this could have a demoralizing effect on the overall program?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think there has been unjust criticism and unfair criticism and uninformed criticism of the poverty program even before Congress passed it. Some people opposed it every step of the way. Some people oppose it now.;I don't know of any national program in peacetime that has reached so many people so fast and so effectively. Over 16,000 Americans have already volunteered to live and work with the Peace Corps domestically. A quarter of a million young men have joined the Job Corps. Every major city has developed poverty plans and made application for funds. Three hundred State, city, and county community action programs have already received their money. Forty-five thousand students from needy families are already enrolled in 800 colleges under the work program. More than 125,000 adults are trainees in adult education on the work-experience program.;We will have difficulties. We will have politicians attempting to get some jobs in the local level. We will have these differences as we do in all of our programs, but I have great confidence in Sargent Shriver 3 as an administrator and as a man, and I have great confidence in the wisdom the Congress displayed in passing the poverty program. I think it will be one of the great monuments to this administration.;3 Director, Office of Economic Opportunity.;FOREIGN ATTITUDES TOWARDS U.S. POLICY IN VIET-NAM [14.] Q. Mr. President, is it true that the United States is losing, rather than making, friends around the world, with its policy in Viet-Nam--sort of a failing domino theory in reverse?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that we have friends throughout the world. I am not concerned with any friends that we have lost. Following my Baltimore speech, I received from our allies almost a universal approval. Our enemies would have you believe that we are following policies that are ill-advised, but we are following the same policies in Asia that we followed in Europe, that we followed in Turkey and Greece and Iran. We are resisting aggression, and as long as the aggressors attack, we will stay there and resist them--whether we make friends or lose friends.;THE VOTING RIGHTS BILL [15.] Q. Mr. President, your voting rights bill is moving toward completion in the Senate this week. Do you think that proposal--the amendment to abolish the poll tax--would make this unconstitutional? Do you think it would damage the passage of the bill in the House and what do you think about it generally?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that is being worked out in the conferences they are having today, and they will have in the next few weeks. I have always opposed the poll tax. I am opposed to it now. I have been advised by constitutional lawyers that we have a problem in repealing the poll tax by statute. For that reason, while a Member of Congress, I initiated and supported a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax in Federal elections.;I think the bill as now drawn will not permit the poll tax to be used to discriminate against voters, and I think the administration will have adequate authority to prevent its use for that purpose. I have asked the Attorney General, however, to meet with the various Members of the House and Senate who are interested in this phase of it, and if possible, take every step that he can within constitutional bounds to see that the poll tax is not used as a discrimination against any voter anywhere.;THE BOMBING OF NORTH VIET-NAM [16.] Q. Mr. President, a number of critics of your Viet-Nam policy say they support our presence in South Viet-Nam, but do not support the bombing raids to the North. I wondered if there is anything you can say to them, and what you can say on any conditions that might arise under which you feel the raids could be stopped?;THE PRESIDENT. I said in my opening statement that we went for months without destroying a bridge, or an ammunition depot, or a radar station. Those military targets have been the primary targets that we have attacked. There is no blood in a bridge made of concrete and steel, but we do try to take it out so that people cannot furnish additional troops and additional equipment to kill the people of South Viet-Nam, and to kill our own soldiers. There are not many civilians involved in a radar station, but we do try to make it ineffective so that they cannot plot our planes and shoot our boys out of the skies.;There are not many individuals involved in an ammunition dump, but we have tried to destroy that ammunition so that it would be exploded in North Viet-Nam and not in the bodies of the people of South Viet-Nam or our American soldiers.;We have said time and time again that we regret the necessity of doing this, but as long as aggression continues, as long as they bomb in South Viet-Nam, as long as they bomb our sports arenas, and our theaters, and our embassies, and kill our women and our children and the Vietnamese soldiers, several thousand of whom have been killed since the first of the year, we think that we are justified in trying to slow down that operation and make them realize that it is very costly, and that their aggression should cease.;I do sometimes wonder how some people can be so concerned with our bombing a cold bridge of steel and concrete in North Viet-Nam, but never open their mouths about a bomb being placed in our embassy in South Viet-Nam. The moment that this aggression ceases, the destruction of their bridges and their radar stations and the ammunition that they use on our bodies will cease.;POSTPONEMENT OF AYUB AND SHASTRI VISITS [17.] Q. Mr. President, on your cancellation of the Ayub and Shastri 4 visits, some of your critics have said that the reasons for your postponement were sound, but the abruptness of it left millions of Asians angry at this country. Is anything being done to correct that impression on their part?;THE PRESIDENT. First of all, I would not assume many parts of your statement.;4 Mohammed Ayub Khan, President of Pakistan, and Lal Bahadur Shastri, Prime Minister of India.;First, we didn't cancel it. So that is the first error that the critics have made. We feel very friendly toward the people of India and the Government of India, toward the people of Pakistan and the Government of Pakistan. I have spent some time in both of those countries. I have had the leaders of those countries visit me in this country and visit in my home.;I have before the Congress now recommendations concerning the peoples of those countries and how we can work together to try to achieve peace in the world.;I said through the appropriate channels to those governments that I had had some eight or nine visitors already the first 90 days of this administration, that the Congress was hopeful that it would get out of here in early summer, that we had approximately 75 top important measures that we were trying to get considered and passed, one of which vitally affected that part of the world, and that I could be much more communicative and could respond much more to their suggestions and to their recommendations on the future of India and their 5-year plan, and Pakistan and their plan, if our visit could follow the enactment of some of these bills instead of preceding them, because if it preceded them, I could not speak with authority. I would not know what the Congress would do.;We have spent in excess of $10 billion in that area, and this year we will propose expenditures of more than $1 billion. But if the Congress said no to me and didn't pass the foreign aid bill or materially reduced it, I would have made a commitment that I could not support, so I said, "If you would like to come now in the month of May or June, during this period, we can have a visit, but we will not be able to be as responsive as I would like to be if you could come a little later in the year.;I have been host a few times in my life and when you put things that way, most people want to come at the time that would be most convenient to us, to the host, and would be most helpful to them. We communicated that to the appropriate people, and the answer came back that they would accept that decision.;I think it was a good decision in our interest and I think it was a good decision in their interest. I am very sorry that our people have made a good deal of it, but the provocation of the differences sometimes comes about, and I regret it. So far as I know, it is a good decision, and a wise one, and one that I would make again tomorrow.;USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS [18.] Q. Mr. President, in light of the news reports that came over the weekend, I wonder if you could clarify for us your position concerning the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons in southeast Asia?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, first of all, I have the responsibility for decision on nuclear weapons. That rests with the President. It is the most serious responsibility that rests with him. Secretary McNamara very carefully and very clearly in his television appearance yesterday covered that subject thoroughly, and I think adequately. 5 There is not anything that I could really add to what he said.;5 The text of Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara's statement, made at a televised news conference at the Pentagon, is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 52, p. 752).;I would observe this: that I have been President for 17 months, and I have sat many hours and weeks with the officials of this Government in trying to plan for the protection and security of our people. I have never had a suggestion from a single official of this Government or employee of this Government concerning the use of such weapons in this area. The only person that has ever mentioned it to me has been a newspaperman writing a story, and each time I tell them, "Please get it out of your system. Please forget it. There is just not anything to it. No one has discussed it with us at all.;I think that when Secretary McNamara told you of the requirement yesterday and that no useful purpose was served by going into it further, I thought it had ended there.;VIET-NAM [19.] Q. Mr. President, the North Vietnamese today, sir, say that in a raid on Sunday the United States and the South Vietnamese used what they called toxic chemicals. Could you tell us, sir, what they might be talking about?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't know. I frequently see statements they make that we never heard of. I don't know about the particular report that you mentioned.;[20.] Q. Mr. President, could there come about, as you now see the situation in Viet-Nam--could there be circumstances in which large numbers of American troops might be engaged in the fighting of the war rather than in the advising and assistance to the South Vietnamese?;THE PRESIDENT. Our purpose in Viet-Nam is, as you well know, to advise and to assist those people in resisting aggression. We are performing that duty there now. I would not be able to anticipate or to speculate on the conduct of each individual in the days ahead. I think that if the enemy there believes that we are there to stay, that we are not going to tuck our tails and run home and abandon our friends, I believe in due time peace can be observed in that area.;My objective is to contribute what we can to assist the people of South Viet-Nam who have lost thousands of lives defending their country, and to provide the maximum amount of deterrent with the minimum cost. They have lost thousands of people since February. We have lost some 40 to 50 people of our own. We could not anticipate in February whether we would lose 50 or whether we would lose 500. That depends on the fortunes and the problems of conflict. But I can assure you that we are being very careful--that we are being very studious--that we are being very deliberate--that we are trying to do everything we can within reason to convince these people that they should not attack, that they should not be aggressors, that they should not try to swallow up their neighbor, and we are doing it with the minimum amount of expenditures of lives that we can spend.;THE STEEL AGREEMENT [21.] Q. Mr. President, labor and management in steel have differing versions of what their increase in productivity is. Can you tell us what your advisers figure this is, and whether you think a settlement in excess of the 2.7 percent of the interim agreement would be acceptable?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't want to pass on it. We have laid down the guideposts. They are well acquainted with them--both management and employees. They have had very responsible negotiations, and we are very pleased with the outcome of those negotiations. We anticipate that they will be confirmed by both parties very shortly, and we believe between now and the September deadline that we will have an agreement. I don't think that I have ever observed a period in the life of free enterprise in this country when American labor and American business have been more responsible, and have been more anxious to work with their Government in maintaining full productivity, and I expect that that will come about.;Merriman Smith (United Press International): Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

I reported the decisions that this Government considers necessary in this situation in order to protect American lives.;The members of the leadership expressed their support of these decisions. The United States Government has been informed by military authorities in the Dominican Republic that American lives are in danger. These authorities are no longer able to guarantee their safety and they have reported that the assistance of military personnel is now needed for that purpose.;I have ordered the Secretary of Defense to put the necessary American troops ashore in order to give protection to hundreds of Americans who are still in the Dominican Republic and to escort them safely back to this country. This same assistance will be available to the nationals of other countries, some of whom have already asked for our help.;Pursuant to my instructions 400 Marines have already landed.

Johnson: Remarks at a Dinner for Presidential Appointees.</td><td class="c6">April 28, 1965</td><td class="c7">Ladies and gentlemen;Mrs. Johnson and I are delighted that we could be here with you in the first house of our land this evening. I think this is the only dinner that we have ever scheduled at the White House that has had to be postponed twice.;I trust that you will understand and indulge me my tardiness this evening, but we found it necessary, in order to protect some of our fellow countrymen, to order in 400 Marines into the Dominican Republic. And they have safely landed there without incident and taken up their duty. And we have--we are in the process now of evacuating Americans. Some 200 have been evacuated and we have about 900 more to go.;I made a brief statement to the press and television cameras, but Mrs. Johnson, who has spent most of her adult life--she hasn't been an adult very long, but most of it trying to learn and understand and appreciate television, couldn't get her set to work over here. I'm sorry you all missed it.;The most important people in this house tonight are not the ones who think they are.;Public service requires much dedication, much devotion, and a great deal of self-sacrifice. For those who occupy the public positions, there are some compensations-some rich and meaningful compensations. But the true heroes--and heroines--of public life are those who give more than a full measure of self-sacrifice and receive less than a full measure of recognition.;There is one such hero--or heroine--in each family represented here tonight.;So I would like those who have received the Presidential appointments to raise their glasses with me to the most important and the most beloved people in these rooms-our wives and our husbands.;All of you that received the Presidential appointments, now stand.;This is an unusually proud occasion for me. Presidents have many duties. The weights and the burdens of this office are always great. But it is a particularly demanding responsibility to select other men and women to discharge the very great responsibility that attaches to every public trust in the Government of the United States.;When I came to this office 17 months ago, I was blessed--and the Nation was blessed-by the quality, the character, and the talent of the team that had been assembled throughout the executive branch by our late, beloved President Kennedy. No one is more aware of my debt to that great and gallant man in this particular regard than am I.;I believe strongly that the staffing of the executive positions of our Government has entered a new era within the past 4 years. At the high tide of our success--in a Nation bursting with more talent and genius than perhaps any other nation has ever known-we have laid aside the old concept that public positions could and would be filled with mediocrity, selected on the basis of political preference. We have gone forth to try to find the best in America to make sure that the functioning of our system is the best in the world.;To me all of you represent the best that America has produced.;One hundred years ago Abraham Lincoln told this story. He said;A fellow once came to me to ask for an appointment as a minister abroad. Finding he could not get that, he came down to some more modest position. Finally, he asked to be made a tidewater. When he saw he could not get that, he asked for an old pair of trousers. It is sometimes well to be humble.;For myself, let me say that there is not a single man or woman in this room who asked me for the job that they have tonight. The job has sought the individual and not vice versa. So long as I am permitted to continue here, this will continue.;I believe this is the way our system was intended to operate. In 1795, the Father of our Country, George Washington, wrote to a friend and explained his philosophy in these words;In the appointments to the great offices of the Government, my aim has been to combine geographical situation, and sometimes other considerations, with abilities and fitness of known characters.;From time to time there may be "other considerations" but our standard today is that standard set by President Washington-- we are concerned "with abilities and fitness of known characters.;Because of the standards that we have set--and the standards that we intend to maintain--you, your families, your children, and your grandchildren can be enormously proud of your association with the Government of the United States of America. There are no unexceptional persons in this room, tonight, because you are the leaders of your generation, of your country, and of the greatest cause in all human history.;I want you to know I am very grateful to each of you for the sacrifices you have made in assuming these responsibilities. I am proud that you are part of this Government and particularly proud that you are a member of my team. We--all of us together, yes, all of us alike--are servants of a great and good people and a strong and successful system that I am proud to have been a part of for more than half of my life--34 years.;I would ask now that you join me in a toast to the people of this country and to the Government of this Nation. May the people of this land live always united in freedom under peace and justice, and may this Government always be their good and their just and their faithful public servant.</td></tr>

Johnson: Statement by the President on the Situation in the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">April 30, 1965</td><td class="c7">Good evening, ladies and gentlemen;For 2 days American forces have been in Santo Domingo in an effort to protect the lives of Americans and the nationals of other countries in the face of increasing violence and disorder. With the assistance of these American forces, over 200 Americans and other nationals have been evacuated from the Dominican Republic. We took this step when and only when, we were officially notified by police and military officials of the Dominican Republic that they were no longer in a position to guarantee the safety of American and foreign nationals and to preserve law and order.;In the last 24 hours violence and disorder have increased. There is great danger to the life of foreign nationals and of thousands of Dominican citizens, our fellow citizens of this hemisphere. By an outstanding effort of mediation the Papal Nuncio has achieved an agreement on a cease-fire which I have urged all those concerned to take. But this agreement is not now, as I speak, being fully respected. The maintenance of the cease-fire is essential to the hopes of all for peace and freedom in the Dominican Republic.;Meanwhile there are signs that people trained outside the Dominican Republic are seeking to gain control. Thus, the legitimate aspirations of the Dominican people and most of their leaders for progress, democracy, and social justice are threatened and so are the principles of the inter-American system.;The inter-American system, and its principal organ, the Organization of American States, have a grave and an immediate responsibility. It is important that prompt action be taken. I am informed that a representative of the OAS is leaving Washington very shortly for the Dominican Republic. It is very important that representatives of the OAS be sent to the Dominican Republic, just as soon as they can be sent there, in order to strengthen the cease-fire and in order to help clear a road to the return of constitutional process and free elections. Loss of time may mean that it is too late to preserve the freedom, which alone can lead to the establishment of true democracy. This, I am sure, is what the people of the Dominican Republic want. Late action, or delay, in such a case could mean a failure to accomplish the agreed objectives of the American states.;The eyes of the hemisphere are now on the OAS, both in its meeting today and on the meeting of its foreign ministers contemplated tomorrow. The wisdom, the statesmanship, and the ability to act decisively of the OAS are critical to the hopes of peoples in every land of this continent.;The United States will give its full support to the work of the OAS and will never depart from its commitment to the preservation of the right of all of the free people of this hemisphere to choose their own course without falling prey to international conspiracy from any quarter.</td></tr>

Their current responsibility extends over nine square miles of a largely urban area. They also have the responsibility for keeping the port area of Haina free from attack from any side. Under current circumstances their capability is not adequate to this mission. For this reason we are lending additional forces. Those forces consist of two battalions of the 82d airborne division comprising approximately 1,500 men and additional detachments of marines.;These forces are engaged in protecting human life. It is our earnest hope that it will not be necessary for them to defend themselves from attack from any quarter.</td></tr>

Its mission is to reestablish peace and normal conditions in that strife-weary island.;The good offices of this commission, representing the entire hemisphere, will be available to every group and party in the Dominican Republic. It will work for a cease-fire. It will try to ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals. And it will investigate every aspect of the current volatile situation in that island.;We look forward, as do all the American States, to the success of the mission, and to any recommendations and suggestions the commission might make.;For our part, the United States is ready to support--with every resource at its command-the inter-American system. We will help carry out the solemn judgments of the assembled American Republics.;And we once again join in the common appeal to put an end to violence. For only when shooting and bloodshed stop will it be possible to work toward the aspirations and hopes of the Dominican people. Progress and justice do not flourish at the point of a gun.;The daily work of the inter-American system is filled with hope for the progress of the American peoples. But it is in moments of crisis such as this we truly test the vitality of our association. We prove that independent and proud nations can work together in the common cause of peace and human liberty.;Our goal in the Dominican Republic is the goal which has been expressed again and again in the treaties and agreements which make up the fabric of the inter-American system. It is that the people of that country must be permitted to freely choose the path of political democracy, social justice, and economic progress. Neither the United States, nor any nation, can want or permit a return to that brutal and oppressive despotism which earned the condemnation and punishment of this hemisphere and of all civilized humanity. We intend to carry on the struggle against tyranny no matter in what ideology it cloaks itself. This is our mutual responsibility under the agreements we have signed, and the common values which bind us together.</td></tr>

Johnson: Radio and Television Report to the American People on the Situation in the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">May 2, 1965</td><td class="c7">Good evening, ladies and gentlemen;I have just come from a meeting with the leaders of both parties in the Congress which was held in the Cabinet Room in the White House. I briefed them on the facts of the situation in the Dominican Republic. I want to make those same facts known to all the American people and to all the world.;There are times in the affairs of nations when great principles are tested in an ordeal of conflict and danger. This is such a time for the American nations.;At stake are the lives of thousands, the liberty of a nation, and the principles and the values of all the American Republics. That is why the hopes and the concern of this entire hemisphere are, on this Sabbath-Sunday, focused on the Dominican Republic.;In the dark mist of conflict and violence, revolution and confusion, it is not easy to find clear and unclouded truths.;But certain things are clear. And they require equally clear action. To understand, I think it is necessary to begin with the events of 8 or 9 days ago.;Last week our observers warned of an approaching political storm in the Dominican Republic. I immediately asked our Ambassador to return to Washington at once so that we might discuss the situation and might plan a course of conduct. But events soon outran our hopes for peace.;Saturday, April 24th--8 days ago--while Ambassador Bennett was conferring with the highest officials of your Government, revolution erupted in the Dominican Republic. Elements of the military forces of that country overthrew their government. However, the rebels themselves were divided. Some wanted to restore former President Juan Bosch. Others opposed his restoration. President Bosch, elected after the fall of Trujillo and his assassination, had been driven from office by an earlier revolution in the Dominican Republic.;Those who opposed Mr. Bosch's return formed a military committee in an effort to control that country. The others took to the street and they began to lead a revolt on behalf of President Bosch. Control and effective government dissolved in conflict and confusion.;Meanwhile the United States was making a constant effort to restore peace. From Saturday afternoon onward, our embassy urged a cease-fire, and I and all the officials of the American Government worked with every weapon at our command to achieve it.;On Tuesday the situation of turmoil was presented to the peace committee of the Organization of American States.;On Wednesday the entire Council of the Organization of American States received a full report from the Dominican Ambassador.;Meanwhile, all this time, from Saturday to Wednesday, the danger was mounting. Even though we were deeply saddened by bloodshed and violence in a close and friendly neighbor, we had no desire to interfere in the affairs of a sister republic.;On Wednesday afternoon, there was no longer any choice for the man who is your President. I was sitting in my little office reviewing the world situation with Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, and Mr. McGeorge Bundy. Shortly after 3 o'clock I received a cable from our Ambassador and he said that things were in danger, he had been informed that the chief of police and the governmental authorities could no longer protect us. We immediately started the necessary conference calls to be prepared.;At 5:14, almost 2 hours later, we received a cable that was labeled "critic," a word that is reserved for only the most urgent and immediate matters of national security.;The cable reported that Dominican law enforcement and military officials had informed our embassy that the situation was completely out of control and that the police and the Government could no longer give any guarantee concerning the safety of Americans or of any foreign nationals.;Ambassador Bennett, who is one of our most experienced Foreign Service officers, went on in that cable to say that only an immediate landing of American forces could safeguard and protect the lives of thousands of Americans and thousands of other citizens of some 30 other countries. Ambassador Bennett urged your President to order an immediate landing.;In this situation hesitation and vacillation could mean death for many of our people, as well as many of the citizens of other lands. I thought that we could not and we did not hesitate. Our forces, American forces, were ordered in immediately to protect American lives. They have done that. They have attacked no one, and although some of our servicemen gave their lives, not a single American civilian and the civilian of any other nation, as a result of this protection, lost their lives.;There may be those in our own country who say that such action was good but we should have waited, or we should have delayed, or we should have consulted further, or we should have called a meeting. But from the very beginning, the United States, at my instructions, had worked for a cease-fire beginning the Saturday the revolution took place. The matter was before the OAS peace committee on Tuesday, at our suggestion. It was before the full Council on Wednesday and when I made my announcement to the American people that evening, I announced then that I was notifying the Council.;When that cable arrived, when our entire country team in the Dominican Republic, made up of nine men--one from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, our Ambassador, our AID man and others--said to your President unanimously: "Mr. President, if you do not send forces immediately, men and women-Americans and those of other lands--will die in the streets"--well, I knew there was no time to talk, to consult, or to delay. For in this situation delay itself would be decision-the decision to risk and to lose the lives of thousands of Americans and thousands of innocent people from all lands.;I want you to know that it is not a light or an easy matter to send our American boys to another country, but I do not think that the American people expect their President to hesitate or to vacillate in the face of danger just because the decision is hard when life is in peril.;Meanwhile, the revolutionary movement took a tragic turn. Communist leaders, many of them trained in Cuba, seeing a chance to increase disorder, to gain a foothold, joined the revolution. They took increasing control. And what began as a popular democratic revolution, committed to democracy and social justice, very shortly moved and was taken over and really seized and placed into the hands of a band of Communist conspirators.;Many of the original leaders of the rebellion, the followers of President Bosch, took refuge in foreign embassies because they had been superseded by other evil forces, and the Secretary General of the rebel government, Martinez Francisco, appealed for a cease-fire. But he was ignored. The revolution was now in other and dangerous hands.;When these new and ominous developments emerged, the OAS met again and it met at the request of the United States. I am glad to say that they responded wisely and decisively. A five-nation OAS team is now in the Dominican Republic acting to achieve a cease-fire to ensure the safety of innocent people, to restore normal conditions, and to open a path to democratic process.;That is the situation now.;I plead, therefore, with every person and every country in this hemisphere that would choose to do so, to contact their ambassador and the Dominican Republic directly and to get firsthand evidence of the horrors and the hardship, the violence and the terror, and the international conspiracy from which U.S. servicemen have rescued the people of more than 30 nations from that war-torn island.;Earlier today I ordered two additional battalions--2,000 extra men--to proceed immediately to the Dominican Republic. In the meeting that I just concluded with the congressional leaders following that meeting I directed the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to issue instructions to land an additional 4,500 men at the earliest possible moment. The distribution of food to people who have not eaten for days, the need of medical supplies and attention for the sick and wounded, the health requirements to avoid an epidemic because there are hundreds that have been dead for days that are now in the streets, and that further protection of the security of each individual that is caught on that island require the attention of the additional forces which I have ordered to proceed to the Dominican Republic.;In addition, our servicemen have already, since they landed on Wednesday night, evacuated 3,000 persons from 30 countries in the world from this little island. But more than 5,000 people, 1,500 of whom are Americans-the others are foreign nationals--are tonight awaiting evacuation as I speak. We just must get on with that job immediately.;The American nations cannot, must not, and will not permit the establishment of another Communist government in the Western Hemisphere. This was the unanimous view of all the American nations when, in January 1962, they declared, and I quote: "The principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of the inter-American system.;This is what our beloved President John F. Kennedy meant when, less than a week before his death, he told us: "We in this hemisphere must also use every resource at our command to prevent the establishment of another Cuba in this hemisphere.;This is and this will be the common action and the common purpose of the democratic forces of the hemisphere. For the danger is also a common danger, and the principles are common principles.;So we have acted to summon the resources of this entire hemisphere to this task. We have sent, on my instructions night before last, special emissaries such as Ambassador Moscoso of Puerto Rico, our very able Ambassador Averell Harriman, and others to Latin America to explain the situation, to tell them the truth, and to warn them that joint action is necessary. We are in contact with such distinguished Latin American statesmen as Romulo Betancourt and Jose Figueres. We are seeking their wisdom and their counsel and their advice. We have also maintained communication with President Bosch, who has chosen to remain in Puerto Rico.;We have been consulting with the Organization of American States, and our distinguished Ambassador, than whom there is no better--Ambassador Bunker--has been reporting to them at great length all the actions of this Government and we have been acting in conformity with their decisions.;We know that many who are now in revolt do not seek a Communist tyranny. We think it is tragic indeed that their high motives have been misused by a small band of conspirators who receive their directions from abroad.;To those who fight only for liberty and justice and progress I want to join with the Organization of American States in saying, in appealing to you tonight, to lay down your arms, and to assure you there is nothing to fear. The road is open for you to share in building a Dominican democracy and we in America are ready and anxious and willing to help you. Your courage and your dedication are qualities which your country and all the hemisphere need for the future. You are needed to help shape that future. And neither we nor any other nation in this hemisphere can or should take it upon itself to ever interfere with the affairs of your country or any other country.;We believe that change comes and we are glad it does, and it should come through peaceful process. But revolution in any country is a matter for that country to deal with. It becomes a matter calling for hemispheric action only--repeat--only when the object is the establishment of a communistic dictatorship.;Let me also make clear tonight that we support no single man or any single group of men in the Dominican Republic. Our goal is a simple one. We are there to save the lives of our citizens and to save the lives of all people. Our goal, in keeping with the great principles of the inter-American system, is to help prevent another Communist state in this hemisphere. And we would like to do this without bloodshed or without large-scale fighting.;The form and the nature of a free Dominican government, I assure you, is solely a matter for the Dominican people, but we do know what kind of government we hope to see in the Dominican Republic. For that is carefully spelled out in the treaties and the agreements which make up the fabric of the entire inter-American system. It is expressed, time and time again, in the words of our statesmen and in the values and hopes which bind us all together.;We hope to see a government freely chosen by the will of all the people.;We hope to see a government dedicated to social justice for every single citizen.;We hope to see a government working, every hour of every day, to feeding the hungry, to educating the ignorant, to healing the sick--a government whose only concern is the progress and the elevation and the welfare of all the people.;For more than 3 decades the people of that tragic little island suffered under the weight of one of the most brutal and despotic dictatorships in the history of the Americas. We enthusiastically supported condemnation of that government by the Organization of American States. We joined in applying sanctions and when Trujillo was assassinated by his fellow citizens we immediately acted to protect freedom and to prevent a new tyranny. And since that time we have taken the resources from all of our people, at some sacrifice to many, and we have helped them with food and with other resources, with the Peace Corps volunteers, with the AID technicians. We have helped them in the effort to build a new order of progress.;How sad it is tonight that a people so long oppressed should once again be the targets of the forces of tyranny. Their long misery must weigh heavily on the heart of every citizen of this hemisphere. So I think it is our mutual responsibility to help the people of the Dominican Republic toward the day when they can freely choose the path of liberty and justice and progress. This is required of us by the agreements that we are party to and that we have signed. This is required of us by the values which bind us together.;Simon Bolivar once wrote from exile: "The veil has been torn asunder. We have already seen the light and it is not our desire to be thrust back into the darkness.;Well, after decades of night the Dominican people have seen a more hopeful light and I know that the nations of this hemisphere will not let them be thrust back into the darkness.;And before I leave you, my fellow Americans, I want to say this personal word: I know that no American serviceman wants to kill anyone. I know that no American President wants to give an order which brings shooting and casualties and death. I want you to know and I want the world to know that as long as I am President of this country, we are going to defend ourselves. We will defend our soldiers against attackers. We will honor our treaties. We will keep our commitments. We will defend our Nation against all those who seek to destroy not only the United States but every free country of this hemisphere. We do not want to bury anyone as I have said so many times before. But we do not intend to be buried.;Thank you. God bless you. Good night.</td></tr>

It was about the most vital issues in this country, and for that matter, in the whole world, which are peace and freedom.;So I have stolen these few minutes to come over here just to say, thank you. Thank you for saying to the world that this Nation of ours, the United States of America, speaks in unity with one voice from one heart. Thanks to you for saying that we believe in freedom and we believe in peace. Thanks to you for saying that we will not buy peace at the price of losing freedom anywhere, any time, in the world. Thanks to you for saying that American labor, the champions of freedom here at home, knows that freedom's frontiers are today in Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic, where both are under attack.;So thank you for putting first things first, for being leaders of the free America today, for being, even before that, the leaders of America herself. And before I overlook it, I want to thank you for what we did last November.;As citizens you must be proud of the fact that you are the builders of America. You know what it is to make something rise with toil and sweat and effort. The product of your labor is not just buildings, and not just homes, and not just monuments. The product of your labor is the face of America itself throughout all the world.;We have seen that face change many times, you and I. We have worked through the darkness in distressing periods. We have worked through the depression, or at least wanted to work during the depression. We have worked through the challenge of conflict, through the prosperity of an uneasy peace.;We share in the legacy of great American leaders, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And I came here this afternoon to pledge to you that together we are going to build an America that Roosevelt began, that Harry Truman worked for, and that John Kennedy died for. We are going to build a Great Society where no man or woman is the victim of fear or poverty or hatred, where every man and woman has a chance for fulfillment, for prosperity, and for hope. That is the direction that you are going. That is the direction that we are going to continue. And I promise you here today that no one, no group here or in any land, is ever going to stand in our way as we march forward.;There is crisis and conflict in many lands at this hour, and we have very great and overpowering responsibilities in a very turbulent world, but we are going to fulfill those responsibilities. Let me make this dean No world problems must be allowed to keep us from meeting the needs and the desires of our own people. Trouble abroad will never divert us from the task of building the Great Society at home.;There are some that would say turn the clock back, stop, look, and listen, we have problems in Viet-Nam and in the Dominican Republic, before you get back to the office we may have some in other lands in the world, and for that reason let's put off until another day the poverty program, the Appalachia program, the medical care program, the education program.;Well, they are just talking through their hat. We are not going to put anything off!;I worked last night on some thoughts that I want to incorporate, when I get the recommendations from your leaders and from the leaders of Government concerned with your welfare, into a message that I will send to Congress in the next few weeks. By the way, while we are talking, I want to make arrangements with you today, while you are here in person, to realize that we don't just send these messages up to Congress to be read. We send them up there to be acted upon and voted upon, up or down. And as Andy Biemiller plows through the dark corridors of the House Office Building calling "wolf" to the White House, I don't want you fellows to run under the bed and hide, either.;There are talkers and there are doers. An old man told me the first year I was in Washington, which was 34 years ago, and I was inquiring about the processes of the Congress, and he said, "Son, there are two kinds of congressional horses, the work horse and the show horse." Well, we want to be work horses, and before this Congress, this 89th Congress, closes its first session, the work horses are going to establish it as the most productive, the most enlightened, the most progressive Congress for all the people that ever sat in Washington.;That is why I came out here this afternoon. I came out here to ask your help. I came out here to call upon you to help me do what you have been doing so well for more than a half century--to help build America, in the cause of freedom and the cause of prosperity, build it here and build it abroad.;We have much to be thankful for. We have much to remember. The figures for the first quarter, January, February, and March, are just out of the typewriter. They show that we have 71,300, 000 people working today. That is exactly 1,500,000 more than were working this day last year, 1 year ago. The figures just out of the typewriter show that wages and salaries amount to $347 billion. That is up more than $25 billion. I said up, now, not down. That is an increase in wages and salaries over last year of 8 percent.;The corporation profit figures for this quarter are just in, and they are running at the rate--they are in for the quarter--but they are running at the rate of $36 billion after taxes. That is up 13 percent.;So our employment is up, our wages are up, our business profits are up. Oh, you just don't know until you talk to the leaders of 114 other nations how much you have got to be grateful for, how much you have got to be proud of!;I have been your President for 17 months. I have met every week with the titans of industry and the great corporate leaders of this country. I have met every week with the religious and spiritual leaders of this country, ranging from Cardinal Spellman to Billy Graham. I have met every week with your leaders, Mr. Haggerty and Joe Keenan and Andy Biemiller, and that great world statesman, George Meany. They have sat in the Cabinet Room. They have met face to face with each other, and they have met privately in the little offices off the corridors. We have started some strikes and we have settled some, but I think I can say without--beyond the peradventure of a doubt that never in the history of the Republic has there been more cooperation with any President, the 35 men that have preceded me, than the cooperation that I have received from labor, from business, from Government.;The judicial branch, the legislative branch, the Congress, headed by that great leader, John McCormack, and Mike Mansfield in the Senate, are work horses. And the executive and the legislative and the judiciary have never gotten along better, just as the employer and the employee and their Government have never gotten along better.;I am happy that the corporations got $36 billion after taxes--I don't begrudge them a dime of it, I helped them make it because they had $72 billion before taxes, and I took half of it. And the more the incentive system and the free enterprise system make, the more they have to pay decent wages, and the more they have to let their Government use for medical care, and for education, and for beautification.;I don't object to the payrolls running $347 billion, because we have some men scattered in district offices all over the land with their scissors that cut out that little withholding from every dollar of that $347 billion. All I want them to do is to do better, because the better they do the better the country does.;Last Saturday, a week ago, our Ambassador from the Dominican Republic was here in Washington. He had been called back here to report on very disturbing developments in that little nation of 3 1/2 million off our shores in this hemisphere.;While he was talking to us, the government was overthrown. We rushed him back to his post of duty. Since that time certain undesirable elements have stepped in and tried to take control of that nation.;Today, there are between 1,000 and 1,500 dead people whose bodies are in the streets of Santo Domingo, threatening an extreme epidemic. There were 8,000 American and foreign nationals in that country whose lives were in danger.;At approximately 3:30, our Ambassador wired me on--well, he was here Saturday, we rushed him back--on Tuesday we went before the OAS Peace Council and discussed that serious problem. On Wednesday, the Organization of American States met and they talked about the gravity of the situation, discussed it thoroughly, and adjourned.;On Wednesday afternoon we were meeting there with what I thought was the greatest problem that we had on our hands-Viet-Nam.;Mr. Rayburn used to say, when these Congressmen poured into his office every day, the fellow would say, "I have the most important problem in the world." He said, "That's what that fellow said that you met going out of here.;I thought this was the most important until I got a cable at 3:16 saying the chief of police and the governmental authorities tell us that American lives are in danger and we can no longer offer them any protection. We notified the appropriate people to stand in readiness and we went ahead to conclude our conference on Viet-Nam.;By 5:16 we had another cable that said, "You must land troops immediately or blood will run in the streets, American blood will run in the streets.;And that is the unanimous decision of every man on the American team. There are nine of them, one from the Army, one from the Air Force, one from the Navy, the Ambassador, one from the USIA, and so forth--what we call a country team, the board of directors in that specific country.;Well, I said I have a meeting on balance of payments with a bunch of bankers and big businessmen in the next room. You get the troops on the way, and you ask the Congressmen, the leadership, to come to the White House and we'll meet at 7 o'clock. That was about 6 o'clock, a little before. I went on with my meeting without discussing it. When we met at 7, talking to the leaders, while I was talking to them, I was handed a note by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which said the Marines have landed. That's a great tribute to Bob McNamara and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for competence and efficiency, that within an hour they can put men ashore without the loss of a single life.;No President ever has a problem of doing what is right. I have never known one to occupy this office--and I have worked with five of them--that did not want to do what is right. The big problem is knowing what is right. But I knew this: This was no time for indecision, or procrastination, or vacillation. The American people hadn't elected their President to dodge and duck and refuse to face up to the unpleasant.;Since that time we have evacuated 2,500 Americans. The Michigan State University jazz band was down there. We got them home. The brewers--the brewery people--I guess they didn't know you all were meeting here in Washington, they were having their convention down there, and we got them home.;There hasn't been a drop of civilian blood shed, although five of our Marines have died because of sniper action, and 41 of our boys are wounded. We have 5,000 nationals from 30 other countries and Americans yet to be evacuated from Santo Domingo and all of the countryside. We will by tonight have 14,000 Americans there to get that job done.;I have had--the Papal Nuncio has sent me a cable congratulating us and commending us for our assistance. The leaders and ambassadors from many countries have told us that the streets would have run red with human blood except for the presence of American troops. The representatives of 30 countries, six of whose embassies were torn to pieces, are expressing their gratitude, but we still have 5,000 to get out. We still have the job of feeding 350,000 people--both the rebels and the loyalists have to eat--because we are humanitarians and we don't want to starve people to death. We have the hospitals full and they are running out of their ears. So we have taken some of David Dubinsky's mobile hospital units and we are putting them in the Dominican Republic to take care of their health.;We are taking sanitary measures so that a serious epidemic won't break out. We have established an international peace zone and asked the Organization of American States of these republics to go there and present us with some plan for setting up a stable government.;We covet no territory. We seek no dominion over anyone. All we want to do is live in peace and be left alone if they will do it. But if they are going to put American lives in danger--where American citizens go that flag goes with them to protect them. You don't know how they appreciate it.;As a little boy I learned a declamation that I had to say in grade school. I don't remember all of it but a little of it is appropriate here this afternoon. It went something like this;I have seen the glory of art and architecture. I have seen the sun rise on Mont Blanc. But the most beautiful vision that these eyes ever beheld was the flag of my country in a foreign land.;Now I am the most denounced man in the world. All the Communist nations have a regular program on me that runs 24 hours a day. Some of the non-Communist nations just kind of practice on me. And occasionally I get touched up here at home in the Senate and the House of Representatives. But that is not important. What is important is just two things in this hemisphere. Number one, that we know, and that they know, and that everybody knows, that we don't propose to sit here in our rocking chair with our hands folded and let the Communists set up any government in the Western Hemisphere.;We have said to the people of the Dominican Republic that we are hopeful that the other nations of this hemisphere will provide some troops to help this cleanup operation, to preserve law and order and peace. We'll provide our share of them and we'd like to bring our boys home as soon as we can evacuate our people.;We have two purposes: We want to evacuate our citizens and we want to preserve, to see that a plan is worked out where the people themselves can select their own government, free from any international conspiracy or any dictatorship of any kind.;We believe the Organization of American States will make such a recommendation. We are not the intervenors in the Dominican Republic. The people that intervened in the Dominican Republic were the people who had been trained outside of the Dominican Republic in guerrilla warfare and came in there to help overthrow that government and to have a Communist seizure of that country. We are there to protect those people and we propose to protect them.;It reminds me of a story I heard as a youngster when Huey Long was here and everybody in the Senate was denouncing him because he had taken his sound truck and gone into Arkansas and helped to elect the first woman elected to the Senate--Mrs. Caraway. People weren't accustomed to electing women to the Senate in those days and to Senators that campaigned for somebody else, and they were a little upset about it, and they were denouncing Long for forgetting States' rights and leaving his State and going into another State.;He sat there all afternoon and let one Senator after another denounce him for importing his sound truck and telling other people what to do and dictating to them. He had this chocolate silk suit on--I'll never forget it--and his bright-toned brown and white shoes, and he was just marching back and forth.;And it came his time to answer them, and he got up and said, "Mr. President, I have been denounced all afternoon." He looked over at Senator Robinson, who was the majority leader and the most powerful man in the Senate--a very robust man, a very rotund man, he had a great big stomach and had a cigar that he always smoked and kept in the corner of his mouth--he was the most powerful man in the Senate.;He walked right over to Joe Robinson, put his hand on his shoulder in a very affectionate and friendly way, and said, "I wasn't in Arkansas to dictate to any human being. All I went to Arkansas for was to pull these big, pot-bellied politicians off this poor little Woman's neck.;All we are in the Dominican Republic for is to preserve freedom and to save those people from conquest. The moment that the Organization of American States can present a plan that will bring peace on the island, and permit us to evacuate our people, and give us some hope of stability in government, we will be the first to come back home.;Now, in these times our enemies want to divide us. They want us to argue among ourselves. They want us to chew on each other.;I read the cables every day and up to the last 3 weeks they have really believed that in Viet-Nam the pressure would become so great on the American President that he would have to pull out. Well, I have had plenty of pressure but they don't know the American President. He is not pulling out until aggression ceases. But they have that hope.;So I warn you and I plead of you, if you have any suggestions or any views, or any differences, with your President--and all of you do at times, we don't see everything alike or we would all want the same wife--but communicate them to me through Uncle Sam, or Western Union, or directly, or through your friends. Don't send them through my intelligence bulletin via Peking, or Hanoi, or Moscow.;A great man said, "United we stand, divided we fall." There never was a period in our national history when unity, understanding, perseverance, and patriotism would pay larger dividends than it would pay now.;I expect the leaders of the labor workers' movement in this country to come up, punch that time clock, stay on that shift until we preserve democracy for ourselves and for free people all around the globe.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks to Committee Members on the Need for Additional Appropriations for Military Purposes in Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">May 4, 1965</td><td class="c7">Ladies and gentlemen of the Congress;I appreciate very much your responding so promptly in coming here this morning.;Late yesterday afternoon after a series of meetings I concluded that it was indicated it would be desirable to meet with the six most important committees in the Congress dealing with our relations with other nations and the security of the country.;I am prepared to submit to the Congress very shortly recommendations. Before I do that, however, I want to review with you some of my thoughts and get your judgment and your counsel and, I trust, your cooperation.;Under existing law we have transfer authority where we can use monies already authorized and appropriated to meet any unusual needs of the services that we may have. I think I need not tell you from the developments of the last few days, that we do have unusual and unanticipated needs in both the Viet-Nam theater and the Dominican Republic. We have been called upon to use men and materials at substantial costs that were not reflected in the budget when it was originally presented to the Congress. Therefore, I am giving serious consideration to asking the Congress to appropriate at an early date an additional $700 million to meet the mounting military needs primarily in Viet-Nam and such expenses as we have had in the Dominican Republic and that we may have in the days to come.;This is in no way a routine appropriation. For each Member of Congress who supports this request is voting to continue our effort to try to halt Communist aggression. Each is saying that the Congress and the President stand before the world in joint determination that the independence of South Viet-Nam shall be preserved and that Communist conquest shall not succeed.;In fiscal 1965 we spent about $1,500 million to fulfill our then commitments in southeast Asia. The pace of activity, however, has been steadily rising because the aggression has been rising and they have stepped up their tempo. The additional funds are needed to make sure that our American boys have not only the best but the most modern supplies and equipment in adequate quantities. They are needed to keep an abundant inventory of ammunition and other expendables. They are needed to build facilities to house and to protect our men and our supplies.;I would contemplate that the entire $700 million would be used in the present fiscal year between now and June 30. Nor can I guarantee to you that this will be the last request as things are now developing. If the need expands, I will of course immediately again turn to the Congress for help. We must do whatever must be done to insure our success. This is the firm and the irrevocable commitment of our people and our Nation, whatever the risk and whatever the cost.;I have reviewed the situation in Viet-Nam many times with the Congress. I have reviewed it many times with the American people, with the diplomats of the world, and in broadcasts which were reproduced throughout the world. South Viet-Nam has been attacked by North Viet-Nam. It has asked our help. We are giving that help, we are giving it because of our commitments, because of our principles, and because we believe that our national interest demands it.;This is not the same kind of aggression which the world has long been used to. Instead of the sweep of invading armies there is the steady and the deadly attack in the night by guerrilla bands that come without warning, that kill people while they sleep.;In Viet-Nam we pursue that same principle which has infused American action in the Far East for a quarter of a century. There are those who ask why this responsibility should be ours. The answer, I think, is simple. There is no one else who can do the job. Our power alone in the final test can stand between expanding communism and independent Asian nations.;Thus when India was attacked it looked to us for help and we gave it immediately. We believe that Asia should be directed by Asians, but that means that each Asian people must have the right to find its own way, not that one group or one nation should overrun all the others.;Now make no mistake about it, the aim in Viet-Nam is not simply the conquest of the south, tragic as that would be. It is to show that American commitment is worthless and they would like very much to do that, and once they succeed in doing that, the gates are down and the road is open to expansion and to endless conquest. Moreover, we are directly committed to the defense of South Viet-Nam beyond any question.;In 1954 we signed the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty and that treaty committed us to act to meet aggression against South Viet-Nam. The United States Senate was called upon to act upon that treaty. It ratified that treaty and that obligation by roll call vote of 82 to 1. Less than a year ago the Congress, by an almost unanimous vote, a vote of 502 to 2, said that the United States was ready to take all necessary steps to meet its obligations under that treaty. That resolution in the Congress expressed support for the policy of three successive American Presidents to help the people of South Viet-Nam against attack. Thus, we cannot and we will not and we must not withdraw or be defeated. The stakes are too high, the commitment too deep, the lessons of history too plain.;We will not use our great power in any reckless or casual manner. We have no desire whatever to expand that conflict. We will do, though, what must be done and we will do only what must be done. For in the long run there can be no military solution to the problems of Viet-Nam and we all realize that. We know that we must find some way, somehow, a path to peaceful settlement, and all the resources and brains of our Government are relentlessly pursuing every possible alternative.;Time and time and time again we have worked to open that path. As I talk to you this morning our allies are cooperating with us in attempting to open that path and find that solution. As I have said to you so many times and to the American people likewise, we are ready to talk any time, anywhere, with any government without conditions. We will go anywhere. We will discuss any subject. We will listen courteously and patiently to any point of view that may offer possibilities of a peaceful solution.;You don't know how much I regret the necessity for ever issuing an order to bomb anything, particularly North Viet-Nam. But we began those bombings after I had been in the Presidency some 14 months and only when patience had been transformed from a virtue into a blunder. Time and time and time again, men, women, and children--Americans and Vietnamese alike--were bombed in their villages and their homes while our forces made no reply. There was, last November, an attack on the Dong Hoi airfield. There was the Christmas Eve bombing of the Brinks Hotel in Saigon. There was the February attack at 2 o'clock in the morning, while our American soldiers slept, at Pleiku, where 14 Americans were killed and 269 seriously wounded.;These are just a few examples of their campaign of terror and attack. We then decided that it was no longer advisable to stand by with our arms folded and see men and women and children murdered and crippled while the bases of these aggressors were immune from reply. But we have no desire to destroy human life. Our attacks have all been aimed primarily at strictly military targets, not hotels, not movie theaters, not American compounds, not embassy buildings.;We destroy bridges that are made up of steel and concrete and bleed little blood, so it is harder for our adversaries to convey their instruments of war from the north to the south. When they get to a bridge that is blown up they must unload everything they have and if possible in crossing a swift stream, take their ferries, and load it on a ferry, and try to get across and then unload it and load it back again, taking increased time and increased effort and slowing down their aggression.;We destroy radar stations--some 10 of them--in order to keep them from spotting our planes and shooting down our American pilots. We destroy central depots for the infiltration of men and arms to the south, depots that furnished the manpower that attacked Pleiku.;We patrol trails in an attempt to halt the invaders. We destroy the ammunition dumps to prevent the use of explosives against our men and our allies.;Who among us can feel confident that we should allow our soldiers to be killed while the aggressor sits secure in his sanctuary protected by a border which he himself has violated a thousand times or more? Well, I do not believe that is the view of the American people and I hope that is not the view of the American Congress.;The bombing is not an end in itself, as we all know. Its purpose is to bring us closer to the final day of peace, and whenever it will serve the interests of peace to do so, we will immediately end it. But let us remember, when we began the bombings there was no talk of negotiations. There were few worldwide cries for peace. Some who now speak loudly were content to permit the Americans and the Vietnamese to continue to die and to suffer at the hands of terror without protest.;Our firmness and the action that we have taken in the last few weeks may well have already brought us much closer to peace.;The conclusion is plain. We will not surrender. We do not wish to engage in a larger conflict. We desire peaceful settlement and reasonable talks. Yet the aggression continues, although we have sent the adversaries messages of our views day after day. Therefore, I see no choice but to continue the course that we are on, filled as it is with peril and uncertainty and cost in both money and men. I believe the American people support that course. I believe they have learned a great lesson of this generation. Wherever we have stood firm, aggression has ultimately been halted. Peace has ultimately been restored and liberty has been maintained. That was true in Iran, that was true in Greece, that was true in Turkey, it was true in the Formosa Straits, that was true in Lebanon and it was true in Korea. It was true in the Cuban missile crisis and it will be true again in southeast Asia.;Our people do not flinch from sacrifice or risk when the cause of freedom demands it, and they have the deep and abiding and true instinct of the American people. When our Nation is challenged it must respond. When freedom is in danger we must face up and stand up to that danger. When we are attacked we must not turn tail and run, we must stand and fight.;I know that the Congress shares these beliefs and I believe the people they represent do likewise.;I do not ask complete approval of every phase and every action of your Government. I do ask for the support of our basic course. What is that? That is resistance to aggression. That is moderation in the use of power. That is a constant search for peace. Nothing will do more to strengthen your country in the eyes of the world than the proof of such national unity which an overwhelming vote for this appropriation would clearly show.;I asked the Armed Services Committee of both Houses, the Foreign Relations and Foreign Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committees to come here. As I said earlier, we can use transfer authority and supply us temporarily for these funds. We need them now, we need them tomorrow, we need them in the days ahead. If there is a general unanimity and willingness to provide them I should like to submit forthwith a message to Congress asking that those learned in our relations with other nations give careful consideration to our recommendation and that the Appropriations Committees meet and act promptly, if that can be done. If it cannot, then we will try to proceed under the authority we have.;I dislike very much to disrupt your schedule and the target dates that you have for various bills but I know of nothing that is needed more just now. Although the volume of money is not excessive in terms of total military appropriations, the volume of information that it will convey is quite important and therefore, unless there is serious objection, with the approval of the leadership, I shall seriously consider transmitting to the Congress before the day is over, the specifics of an appropriation for $700 million and ask the House to go into immediate session, if it can, and its committees, and try to report that situation as early as possible.;I have been President now for about 17 months. We have suffered losses that can never be replaced. But our allies have suffered losses too. In South Viet-Nam, that little country of 14 million people has lost more than 10,000. During that same time they have killed 25,900 Viet Cong. In the last few days it is apparent something is taking place there that we cannot speak of with certainty, but the incidents that the Viet Cong initiated have diminished. The losses they have suffered have substantially increased. The arrogance and adventure they once displayed has to some degree been curbed.;I have considered every alternative that I know to consider. I have listened to every voice that sought to give me information. There are those who feel that we should take our strategic forces and try to obliterate the enemy and destroy his cities and wipe out his population. We have hoped to avoid that. There are some who sincerely and genuinely feel that we ought to be out of southeast Asia altogether and retire to our own shores, that we really have no great interest there, and that we ought to pull out.;That argument would have had much more force if we had not concluded otherwise as a policy of the Congress and had not entered into treaties that bound us there. But if our word and our treaty in southeast Asia is no good, it is no good in Berlin, and it is no good with all the other dozens of nations that we have made commitments to and that we are bound to with treaty.;There are those who frequently talk of negotiation and political settlement and that they believe this is the course we should pursue, and so do I. When they talk that way I say, welcome to the club. I want to negotiate. I would much rather talk than fight and I think everyone would. Bring in who you want us to negotiate with. I have searched high and wide and I am a reasonably good cowboy and I can't even rope anybody and bring him in that is willing to talk and reason and settle this thing by negotiation. We send them messages through our allies--one country, two countries, three countries, four or five countries--all have tried to be helpful. The distinguished British citizen, Mr. Walker, has just been out there and they said, "We won't even talk to you." All our intelligence is unanimous in this one point, that they see no need for negotiation. They think that they are winning and that they have won and why should they sit down and give us something and settle with us.;So we can't go north and we shouldn't go south and we can't negotiate. So what do we do? Well, this is the situation that I inherited. It is the policy that we decreed in 1954. So with the problem confronting me, they are the facts as I see them. I have tried to provide the maximum amount of deterrence to aggression with the minimum loss of life to ourselves and to our allies. That we will continue to do until someway, somehow, we find a civilized solution and a readiness to exchange views across the conference table.;Now the expenditure is not great in the Dominican Republic, but we do have many thousand men there. We do have 5,000 people yet to evacuate.;We were sitting quietly in my little office last Thursday afternoon, I believe--Wednesday afternoon maybe--discussing the logistics involved in the Viet-Nam situation with Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara and a cable came from our Ambassador, who is an experienced man in the Foreign Service for 20 years, an expert on the Dominican Republic and because he had been there before and had tours of duty there we sent him back. He said that he had been notified by the governmental authorities and by the police authorities, including the chief of police, that American lives were in danger, that they could not give them any more protection, that we were on our own and that we should immediately take measures to protect them.;The Ambassador said, "This concerns me but I am not prepared at this moment to recommend that you take this action, but I do want to alert you and see that you have a contingency plan ready.;We had anticipated difficulty there. The intelligence reports each morning indicate difficulties in dozens of spots throughout the world. We were due at least one revolution in another country yesterday. It didn't come through but the intelligence reports had indicated it might. Because we had had that information and because we knew the difficulty and we knew the unsettled political condition, we had asked Ambassador Bennett to come back to the United States and he was here when the government was overthrown. We immediately rushed him back. This was his cable informing us that he had had official notification that they could no longer guarantee the safety of our people.;We immediately alerted the forces who had had previous plans, and some of them had been working on building them up and carrying them out, and continued our discussions when another wire came in at 5:16, almost 2 hours later, and said, "There is firing in the streets, there is great danger to all personnel in this area, land the troops immediately to protect our people." It was a rather strong and compelling and almost distress message. Thanks to the expert management of Secretary McNamara and the forces under his command we passed out an order immediately to land our troops.;I had to attend a balance of payments meeting with some bankers who were in town but I asked while I was attending it they call the leadership of the Congress and they did, and they came to the White House around 7 o'clock. While we were talking to them I had a report that our troops had already landed, showing the speed and the efficiency of that group.;Since that time we have evacuated approximately 3,000 persons. It has been necessary for a few Marines to go out and take an old lady and her little belongings and with a crippled hip, carry her down through the streets where the firing is taking place and finally get her to a boat. But we have carried 3,000 that way without the loss of a single civilian up to now.;There remain 5,000 others--1,500 Americans and some 3,500 other nationals. Six or eight of the embassies have been torn up. There has been almost constant firing on our American embassy. As we talked to Ambassador Bennett, he said to apparently one of the girls who had brought him a cable, "Please get away from the window, that glass is going to cut your head," because the glass was being shattered. And he said "Do you hear the bullets coming through the office?"--where he was sitting while talking to us.;We have sufficient manpower there to continue that evacuation and some 200 are coming out today that we have gathered. We will continue until all who will come are evacuated.;In our first meeting that night from 3 o'clock when we got our cable, until 7 o'clock when we met with the congressional leaders, our intelligence indicated that two of the prime leaders in the rebel forces were men with a long history of communistic association and insurrections. One had fought in the Spanish Civil War and both had been given detailed lengthy training in operations of this type.;As reports came in, as they do every few minutes, it developed that there were 8 of those who were in the movement that had been trained by Communist forces. Alerts were set up and our men continued to ferret out and study the organization. Up to yesterday they had the names and addresses and experience and numbers and backgrounds of some 58. As those 58 came forward and the cream began to rise on that crock of milk, they came to the surface and took increased leadership in the movement, and the leaders and friends of ex-President Bosch were more or less shoved in the background and stepped aside.;Our military people outlined a plan and that plan has been consummated.;It is our hope that the OAS will, after a visit on the grounds, come up with recommendations as to an interim government that will not involve either communism or dictatorship until we can have free elections and self determination.;On Saturday when the revolution took place, we asked for a cease-fire. On the following Tuesday our Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Latin American Affairs, Mr. Vaughn, met with the Peace Committee of the OAS and explained the gravity of that situation. On Wednesday morning, before our intervention Wednesday afternoon, the OAS met and discussed the matter thoroughly and in some detail but then adjourned without taking any action. Wednesday afternoon after getting the 3 o'clock wire and the 5 o'clock wire I had no choice but to take action or to sacrifice American lives.;I took the action and simultaneously notified the OAS again and asked them to act. They met. They discussed the matter and then they adjourned over an extra day. When I found that out the next morning I asked Secretary Rusk and our very able diplomat, Mr. Bunker, to give them an urgent appeal not to stay out of session a day but to come back and immediately send some delegation there to view the situation. They had agreed to send Secretary General Morn and he went that night and they met the next day and debated it that day and sent the delegation down there and it is there now.;We want very much to work and cooperate with them and as soon as they have outlined a program for a stable and peaceful interim government we would hope that we could embrace their suggestions and contribute what we need to contribute along with other nations.;We have sent able emissaries to explain all that I have said to you to other countries because a man's judgment is no better than his information and there hasn't been full information on this subject. We have indications that some of the Latin American countries might perhaps be willing to supply some of their forces to engage in the protection during this period. We would certainly hope that is true.;Now that is where we stand. The primary reason for asking you to come here this morning is to let you know that the situations that confront us had not been planned when we submitted our budget to you, that your Armed Forces now are in need of $700 million. We are prepared to testify on it this afternoon or any time that may meet your pleasure. We would hope that you could thoroughly and carefully consider it and with a minimum of division and discord say to the rest of the world that we are going to spend every dollar, we are going to take every action, we are going to walk the last mile in order to see that peace is restored, that the people of not only the Dominican Republic but South Viet-Nam have the right of self-determination and that they cannot be gobbled up in the 20th century and swallowed just because they happen to be smaller than some of those whose boundaries adjoin them.;I think it is well to remember that there are a hundred other little nations sitting here this moment watching what happens and what the outcome is in South Viet-Nam and if South Viet-Nam can be gobbled up the same thing may happen to them.;Secretary Rusk is here to give you any details on the political developments. Secretary McNamara is here to give you any of the details on the posture of our troops, the missions they are performing.;I think there is one point I would like to make before I close. We are not the aggressor in the Dominican Republic. Forces came in there and overthrew that government and became aligned with evil persons who had been trained in overthrowing governments and in seizing governments and establishing Communist control and we have resisted that control and we have sought to protect our citizens against what would have taken place.;Our Ambassador reported that they were marching a former policeman down the streets and had threatened to line a hundred up to the wall and turn a machine-gun loose on them. With reports of that kind, no President can stand by. So we resisted their aggression to the extent that (a) we protected our own people, and (b) we hoped that we have exposed what leadership attempted to seize that little island. We have a good many people there. We are trying to feed all the people. I notice this morning they demanded that none of the labels have "American food" on them but some people haven't eaten in 4 days.;We have from 1,000 to 1,500 bodies that are dead in the street and the possibilities of a serious epidemic breaking out. We are trying to avoid that. We have our mobile hospital units that are trying to give treatment to the wounded and the casualties who have not yet died.;We are doing what we can do to preserve order, yet the sniping is still taking place. There are men still standing on rooftops that are shooting at not only our own embassy but other people and just fortunately none of our civilians have yet been killed. But we do have 5,000 yet there that must be moved individually, one by one, to our ships.;While we are doing that we optimistically hope and pray that the OAS and this inter-American group can make some satisfactory suggestions.;If it is agreeable, the press will excuse themselves now, I would like for Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara to go into details with some of you.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at a Dinner Meeting of the Texas Electric Cooperatives, Inc.</td><td class="c6">May 4, 1965</td><td class="c7">Mr. Chairman, Senator Yarborough, Congressman Patman, ladies and gentlemen;I am glad to know that Babe Smith and the Pedernales Electric Cooperative and the Blue Bonnet Cooperative are sponsoring this dinner. I have never known Babe to be a fast man with a buck. So we can all be mighty sure that the Texas congressional delegation rates pretty high--at least with Babe.;As a matter of fact, if I had not had some problems to worry with tonight myself, I would have come over a little sooner, because all of my family's life we have been paying out to the Pedernales Electric Co-op, and tonight I could have had one meal on them without that monthly minimum.;You have all followed the events of the past few days, I am sure. So I think you know why I am here.;For all of my public life, when I am in need of light I turn to the REA. I know that some of you were first against my policy about turning out lights in the White House until you found out that we were serviced over there by private power and then you regarded that as a step in the right direction.;For years everyone has wondered what there would be to do when all rural America had electricity. Well, I think now you have the answer--you are going to help electrify the rest of the world.;Tonight, an REA team is in South Viet-Nam at my request, talking and planning and working with the officials there, to find ways to bring the healing miracle of electricity to that poor, war-torn countryside where the per capita income is $50 a year, and where the average person's span of life is 35 years.;So we must be ready to fight in Viet-Nam, but the ultimate victory will depend upon the hearts and the minds of the people who actually live out there. By helping to bring them hope and electricity you are also striking a very important blow for the cause of freedom throughout the world.;Wherever we are in the world, whatever we are doing in faraway places--many with strange-sounding names--we are doing it not for power, not for territory, not for dominion, or not for influence. It is none of these things that we want. We want nothing that someone else has. We are there because we have to be. We are there so that the free choice of peoples to select their own pathway to their own future can be preserved. We are there because the United States of America in 1954 gave our word, and our pledge, and our commitment. And we keep it.;As we labor there tonight, there are a hundred other little nations in the world that are looking, and watching, and hoping, and praying, because if we are unsuccessful there they know they are next on the list. Once our promise is broken in one place, even though it is a little country called South Viet-Nam, America's promise is worthless in all places. Once we ignore and fail to live up to our treaty in southeast Asia, our treaty in Berlin is not worth the scrap of paper it is written on.;This has been a rather long day for me, and I suspect the night will be even longer. But however heavy the burden and however demanding the task, we are not about to flag or to fail.;Whether it be in Viet-Nam, where a brave people struggle for their own freedom, or whether it is in the Dominican Republic, where the spoilers of freedom have plundered and killed, this Nation--your country--will do what is right, and will do what is just, and will do what is needed, when it is needed.;I don't want to keep you long this evening. I would hope that some of my problems go away with the dispatch that I am to depart this rostrum tonight. But I could not let you come to Washington without telling you of my gratitude and the affection that I have had for all the REA people since REA was born.;The REA is, has been, and I hope always will be my friend. I want to keep it that way.;And now just one other thought. There are 531 men and women associated with me in attempting to provide leadership to this great country in these troubled and critical times when we never know what the next moment will offer. In that group, Texas has one of the largest delegations, and one of the most trusted and most able.;While I have been known to differ with my fellow men in Congress--of both parties--from time to time, I have not found it necessary to ever criticize or to quarrel with any of the members of my delegation from my State.;I have been President 17 months and they have supported me beyond my wildest and fondest expectations. When they could vote with me, and for me, in good conscience, they were down on the front row with their flag flying high. When they couldn't, they were frank and friendly, and praying that I would not make that mistake again.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks to the Delegates to the White House Conference on Natural Beauty.</td><td class="c6">May 25, 1965</td><td class="c7">Mr. Rockefeller, Members of Congress, participants and observers of the White House Conference on Natural Beauty;First, before I begin my prepared remarks, I want to thank the four outstanding panelists who made these reports. I was inspired by their words and by their plans. I will comment on them a little bit later, but I want to present to you one of our greatest Americans, and a person who is my strong right arm in all of my endeavors from natural beauty to Viet-Nam, the Vice President, Mr. Hubert Humphrey.;Today I worked and thought about problems in Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic.;I had to consider decisions which might affect the security of this country, the lives of Americans, and the destiny of other nations. Yet this may be the most important thing that I have done and am doing today, and I am confident that this is the most important group that I will see. For this is part of what all the rest is for.;We have increased the wealth of our Nation and the prosperity of our people. Yet we did not do this simply to swell our bank deposits, or to raise our gross national product. The purpose of this Nation cannot be listed in the ledger of accounts. It is to enrich the quality of people's lives--to produce the great men and women which are the measure of a Great Society.;And that is what you have been here trying to do.;We have also built the most powerful defense in the world, and that power is now on guard in the Caribbean and in southeast Asia, and in a dozen other quieter places. But we did not forge this shield for freedom simply to be safe and secure, or free from risk or sacrifice. We built it to liberate our energies for a society where each person could use all of his full powers--a civilization for the flowering of man. And this, too, is what you are trying to do.;Crisis and conflict command the headlines. But it is your work that will shape the future.;For natural beauty is not a luxury for the satisfied. It is not a pleasant frill or a superficial enjoyment. Natural beauty, as you and I conceive it, is the world that we live in. It is the environment in which we were born, and grow to maturity, and live our lives.;It is more than a rich source of pleasure and recreation. It shapes our values. It molds our attitudes. It feeds our spirit, and it helps to make us the kind of men and women that we finally become. And the kind of men that we finally become in turn makes this great Nation.;The importance of natural beauty cannot be easily measured. It cannot be coded for computers or calculated by economists. But it is proved beyond doubt by the history of the race and the experience of our own lives.;The force of natural beauty--its meaning to the life of man--infuses art and culture throughout the Western civilization. Each generation from the beginning has drawn from it strength and meaning and even truth. And nowhere has it played a greater role than here in our beloved America.;At first there seemed no end to the limitless wonder of the land. And then, the country grew. There came a time of greed and ignorance and ruthless exploitation.;Far-sighted leaders, from Theodore Roosevelt to John Kennedy, acted to halt decay and tried to preserve our natural splendor.;Last year I signed more than 30 important conservation bills into public laws--the greatest record of conservation since the Republic was born. But this accomplishment was only the beginning. This year I have sent to the Congress already, new bills--bills to protect our great wild rivers, bills to create new parks, bills to provide funds for areas of recreation and pleasure throughout our metropolitan areas. I predict here this afternoon, that 1965 will set new records in conservation in America.;Now these are important measures for our people, but most of them are expansions of the classic role of conservation.;Today, natural beauty has new enemies and we need new weapons to fight those enemies. They are the products of the modern world. In many ways they are the dark side of the bright achievements which have helped us to grow and to prosper and to improve our welfare.;The technology which has given us everything from the computer to the teleprompter, has created a hundred sources of blight. Poisons and chemicals pollute our air and our water. Automobiles litter our countryside. These and other waste products of progress are among the deadliest enemies that natural beauty has ever known.;Urbanization is another modern threat. More and more our people crowd into the cities, cutting themselves off from nature. Cities themselves then grow and spread, often devastating the countryside. And in every corner of the land the Nation builds and builds and builds: highways and restaurants, factories and neon signs. And far too often we finish the marvels of progress, only to find that we have diminished the life of man.;This is not the consequence of the deliberate depredations of a few. Rather it is the result of uncontrolled growth and building, uninformed by the need to protect nature, unchecked by the citizens whose world is really being blighted.;This is why I have called for a new conservation: to restore as well as to protect, to bring beauty to the cities as well as to keep it in the countryside, to handle the waste products of technology as well as the waste of natural resources.;And there is something more, too. I believe in and I have fought all my life for more national parks and rivers, and forests and wilderness. But beauty cannot be a remote and just an occasional pleasure. We must bring it into the daily lives of all our people. Children, in the midst of cities, must know it as they grow. Adults, in the midst of work, must find it near their sight. All of us, in the midst of increasing leisure, must draw sustaining strength from its presence.;All this must be true if we are to ever really have a Great Society.;And none of it is going to be easy. The Federal Government, as long as I head it, will do its part.;But it will also require a most active concern and a practical program in every State capitol and in every city hall of this country. And in that connection, Mrs. Johnson told me, just as we entered the room, that three or four Governors were already following the example you have set here in calling State conferences on natural beauty where they will spend 2 days reviewing and evaluating and analyzing the problems at the State level, truly exercising their much boasted right of State's rights.;I am going to be disappointed if there is a single person in this room, representing a single State, that returns to that State and doesn't communicate with their Governor and see that not just three or four States follow this example, but all 50 of them have State conferences on natural beauty.;I think it is going to demand that all of our private citizens be constantly alert to stimulate, to inspire, and to stem new danger to beauty. For it is the quality of our lives that is really at stake.;All of this, at every level, has been begun by this conference. And this is not just the first White House Conference on Natural Beauty, it is one of the largest and I think the most impressive conferences that we have ever held. Experts, officials, and concerned citizens--in every field--from each of the States have come to Washington to try to help us make this a better and a more beautiful land.;I know for many of you it was not easy to attend. Most of you are busy people with much to do. But there is nothing that is more important. For you are helping to provide an enriching environment for almost 200 million Americans. You are working to extend the national heritage of beauty to successive generations of Americans. And you are laying one of the great cornerstones for the Great Society.;I have received reports on your progress from my staff. I have heard many observers, including my wife, say that your deliberations have been marked by expert knowledge, by a zeal for our cause, and an awareness of the demands of practical progress. The reports that I have just listened to, which I realize cover just a few of the highlights, reflect the impressive nature of your achievement.;I intend to make full use of all of your work and I hope that local government officials, as well as the Governors themselves in every State in the Union, will do the same. All America is deeply in the debt of that selfless patriot, Laurance Rockefeller, for the job that he has done.;Someone asked me the other day about how I liked to live in the White House, and they told me it was off the record. And I said, "Well, we do have our problems. We wake up early in the morning when the planes are coming back from the raids. We go to work and we come to a late lunch and, if we are lucky, we get a little nap after a bowl of soup, and get refreshed for the next part of that day from 4 until 12. But sometimes I am interrupted in that nap by Lady Bird and Laurance Rockefeller, and about 80 others in the next room, talking about flowers, roadsides, and so forth.;This afternoon, after a particularly hectic day yesterday and after a late lunch, I went in about 4:15 to get my afternoon nap in preparation for a day that will carry me up to midnight, and I dozed off to sleep immediately after I put my head on the pillow. And sometime or other I waked up and I could hear a little soft music in the background and a lot of conversation. And I said, "My! am I dreaming? Is Laurance Rockefeller back in town again?" I got up and went out and pulled the curtain and peeped behind it and looked, and there was not only Laurance Rockefeller and Lady Bird and the 60 that started out with them, but a thousand more that had joined them!;Now, what are we going to do about all this, here in the Federal Government? Well, first, after I review all your reports, I am going to send them to the members of my staff and to all the members of the Cabinet. They are going to be instructed to review all of your recommendations for Federal action. As many as feasible are going to be included in my next State of the Union Message and my next legislative program to the Congress.;I hope that you won't keep this conference and its achievements and its hopes and its dreams and its plans a secret from those Members of Congress from your State.;In this hour of our national history I am proud to report to you that I doubt that we have ever had groups working more together, with more of them with their shoulder to the wheel--the captains of industry, the managers of business, the holders of stock, the laborers and the workers in the mills and the mines. The women have come out of the kitchen and have gone out among us to lead the more modest ones. The minority groups, all of them, through their Congress are working to give us the greatest legislative program that this country has ever written.;There is less hate, there is less bigotry, there is less prejudice, there is less jealousy, there is less partisanship in your Congress among your Members of the House and Senate than any time that I know of in the 35 years that I have been here.;So for natural beauty, our next State of the Union Message to the Congress will contain our recommendations that require legislation and I will immediately give careful consideration to any that require immediate executive action and that can be taken without legislation.;Second, all recommendations for State and local action will be sent to the Governors of the States, and the mayors and the town officials across the country. Wherever further information is needed I will send a personal representative to explain your proposals as well as the Federal program.;In addition, I intend to call for a series of regional and local conferences to discuss specific ways to ensure natural beauty in each section of this country. And the members of the Cabinet and the authorities in this field will be available for those conferences and I have already said to the members of the Cabinet that this is required reading.;Third, all the recommendations calling for citizen action and public education will go to the local governments and the private groups in every State. In the Federal Government itself, I will set up a special unit for citizen education to help inform people how they can best combat blight and decay in their own neighborhoods, and I hope that every Governor in every State will do the same.;In this way I think we can keep the fruits of this enormous effort, that Mr. Rockefeller has provided the leadership for, from being dissipated. We can truly translate your work into action and action into pleasure and sustenance for every American.;I know you will be glad to hear that we have not even waited for the end of this conference to take important action, based in part on your discussions in several fields.;At two Cabinet meetings I have asked each Secretary to give high priority to making sure all our programs advance the natural beauty of America. I have asked for a progress report this month. I can inform you that in response to this request your Government has taken hundreds of important steps already-large and small--to increase natural beauty. We still have a long way to go, but I am determined that this Government in all of its activities shall be a model and a pacesetter for the entire Nation. Every public building that is built will be built under a natural beauty microscope.;In addition, tomorrow I will send to the Congress four new bills to help make our Nation's highways sources of pleasure and sources of recreation. Two of these bills will require the use of some of our highway funds for landscaping, beautification, scenic roads, and recreation along our roads system.;This is not a use of highway funds for an alien purpose. It is a recognition that a highway is more than a ribbon of concrete. It is a way for people to travel, and it should serve all their human needs.;Its purpose is not just to get people from one place to another. Its purpose is to enrich the journey. I hope, if you have an opportunity, that you will tell your Congressmen and Senators of your interests.;The other two bills that we are sending will eliminate outdoor advertising signs and junkyards from the sight of the interstate and primary highway system--except in those areas of commercial and industrial use. Advertising has a vital place in our economy, and junkyards are a product of the inability of technology in the 20th century to dispose of old cars. But these old cars must not be allowed to scar the traveler's view of nature.;I thought that you would be glad to know that we have not been idle while you had been working.;I wish you could all know how wonderful it makes me feel to be able to come here and spend a few moments with you. Even the elements made their contribution to the natural beauty of the White House lawn, and the trees, and the flowers, this afternoon.;So much of a President's time is devoted to protecting the Nation, and to putting down danger and to preventing destruction. These are necessary things and your President must do them for you.;Yet, my real ambition is to help our people build, and that is really what you have been doing these days. You don't know how it lifts my heart to be able to join you here this afternoon and to feel that I am sharing in your task.;I remember when I was a very young man--a boy that walked through the sand, hot sand, up to see my grandfather--a child of 5 or 6. I would cross the dusty field and walk along the banks of the river.;My granddaddy would ask me questions. He would say: How many ponies do you have? How many chickens do you have? How many cows are down there at your little place? Tell me about the state of the crops, when are you going to start picking your cotton?;I would stand there and wiggle my toes in the sand with my finger in my month. And if I knew the answers and answered all of his questions correctly, grandpa would take me in and open a black mahogany desk he had and reach in and get an apple. And I would walk satisfied, and quite proudly, back across the fields along the banks of the river. If I failed, the walk seemed endless-if I hadn't known the answers.;And those hills, and those fields, and that river were the only world that I really had in those years. So I did not know how much more beautiful it was than that of many other boys, for I could imagine nothing else from sky to sky. Yet the sight and the feel of that country somehow or other burned itself into my mind.;We were not a wealthy family, but this was my rich inheritance. All my life I have drawn strength, and something more, from those Texas hills. Sometimes, in the highest councils of the Nation, in this house, I sit back and I can almost feel that rough, unyielding, sticky clay soil between my toes, and it stirs memories that often give me comfort and sometimes give me a pretty firm purpose.;But not all the boys in America had the privilege to grow up in a wide and open country. We can give them something, and we are going to. We can let each of them feel a little of what the first settlers must have felt, as they stood unbelieving before the endless majesty of our great land. Thus, they, too, will reach for the wonders of our future, reinforced by the treasured values of our past.;I have one thought here that I overlooked. I don't know whether you think that is true or not, in light of how long I have talked, but we have 24 million acres in our National Park Service. I asked a young friend of mine to go out and ask Bob McNamara how many acres we declared surplus this year from our military establishments. Our military establishments now consume about half of our Federal budget. He tells me that we will make available, from the Office of Defense, 1,200,000 extra acres of land this year.;So, that is one-twentieth--one-twentieth of the acreage we accumulated since this country was born in national parks. One twentieth of it will be made available this year in substantial blocks. First priority is the State and local governments, the park services, the park systems, the recreation bodies.;In the State of California, a camp available there has more than 20,000 acres of land. An Air Force base in one of our Southern States has more than 5,500 acres of land. An Air Force base in one of the smallest Western States has more than 7,500 acres of land.;I have asked the Secretary of Defense to work very closely with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to be sure that, before we put this land on the auction block, that the servants and representatives of the people themselves will have a chance to look at it and evaluate it, and see how it can be used in our public system for recreation and natural beauty down through the years.;Now, you men will forget a lot of things that were said here today, and you will go back home and talk big about what you did. I don't know really how much will come out of it, and I am going to leave what you men do up to Lady Bird.;But you women, when you start out after something, you don't ever give up. I want you to remember one thing I say, if you don't remember anything else, that we ought to be very careful to see that every single acre of this land that can be used, that now we have public title to, is turned over to the National system, or the State system, or the local system, or some public system, so that it is maintained for our children, and our children's children.;I want you women to get in touch with your Congressmen, and with your Governor, and with you mayor, and with the rest of the people, and get that job done for me.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Johnson: Commencement Address at Baylor University.</td><td class="c6">May 28, 1965</td><td class="c7">Mr. President, members of the board of trustees, the faculty and student body, my fellow Americans;This is a moment that I deeply wish my parents could have lived to share. In the first place, my father would have enjoyed what you have so generously said of me--and my mother would have believed it.;More than that, the honor you pay me is, in a real sense, honor that is due my mother. All of her life she spoke often of Baylor-a trait I have found not uncommon among all of your alumni. Her pride in Baylor-and in being the granddaughter of a president of Baylor--passed on to me early and influenced the course of my own life more constructively than I could ever describe.;So, I am most grateful to you for this moment, and for its meaning to me.;Woodrow Wilson once told the men of Princeton that: "It is not learning--but the spirit of service--that will give a college place in the public annals of the Nation.;For 120 years, Baylor University has touched the lives of many generations with an unusual spirit of selfless service. That spirit--expressed in the works of ministers and missionaries, of public servants and public school teachers, of devout parents and dedicated citizens--has not only won for Baylor a place of esteem in this State and this Nation, it has served the betterment of the condition of man to the remote ends of this earth.;On this occasion, we meet here today at an historic hour in the life of the American nations.;In Washington, leaders of this hemisphere are meeting to work together to open a road to durable peace in the Dominican Republic.;Their efforts will have our full support. For at stake is the future not only of one of our sister Republics but the principles and the values of all the American Republics.;We are members of an inter-American system in which large and small nations are partners in the defense of freedom and in the progress of economic welfare and social justice.;That partnership must be constantly strengthened. Our common aim and our combined ability must increase in crisis as well as in calm. The tragedy of the past 4 weeks in the Dominican Republic renews our common resolution to accept common responsibility in dealing with common dangers.;In that unfortunate nation, 4 weeks ago, the legacy of dictatorship exploded in fury and anarchy. Hundreds of Dominican s died, leaving thousands of widows and orphans of war. Nineteen of our own American boys lost their lives. The capital dry, birthplace of the Western Hemisphere, was split asunder. Blood and hate drowned ideals. And for days freedom itself stood on the edge of disaster.;In those early terrible hours, we did what we had to do. Remembering Simon Bolivar's admonition that "to hesitate is destruction," as your President I did what I had to do.;Since then, working with the Organization of American States and its distinguished Secretary General, Jose Mora, the forces of democracy have acted. The results are clear.;More than 6,500 men and women and children from 46 different countries have been evacuated. Not a single life was lost.;A cease-fire was achieved, bringing an end to the threat of wholesale bloodshed.;An international zone of refuge was opened as a haven for all men of peace, and a safe corridor 17 miles long was established by American men.;More than 8 million pounds of food have been distributed to the Dominican people.;A well-trained, disciplined band of Communists was prevented from destroying the hopes of Dominican democracy.;Political avenues were opened to help the Dominican people find a Dominican solution to their problems.;Today those achievements are guaranteed-guaranteed by the troops of five nations representing this hemisphere. They are under the command of the able Brazilian general, General Alvim.;For the first time in history the Organization of American States has created and sent to the soil of an American nation an international peace-keeping military force.;That may be the greatest achievement of all.;The United States made its forces a part of that Inter-American Force. And, as the contributions of the Latin American nations have been incorporated into the OAS force, in the last 2 days the United States has removed 1,600 troops from the island.;I am issuing orders this morning to remove an additional 1,700 men on Saturday. I have also instructed our commander, General Palmer, to discuss possible further withdrawals with General Alvim. Such action will be taken when the military commanders believe it is safe and warranted by the arrival of further Latin American forces or by the continued stabilization of the military situation.;Now we ask ourselves this morning: What is next?;The answer to that question rests partly with the people of the Dominican Republic and partly with their neighbors throughout this hemisphere.;Already, under the distinguished leadership of Secretary General Mora, the broad outlines of a reasonable settlement are beginning to emerge--outlines which meet the needs and respond to the desires first of the Dominican people themselves and then of all the people of this hemisphere.;First, the Dominican people, and the people of their sister Republics, do not want government by extremists of either the left or fight. That is clear. They want to be ruled neither by an old conspiracy of reaction and tyranny nor by a new conspiracy of Communist violence.;Second, they want, as we do, an end to slaughter in the streets and to brutality in the barrios.;Third, they want, as we do, food and work and quiet in the night.;Fourth, they want, as we do, a constitutional government that will represent them all and work for all their hopes.;Fifth, the Dominican people know they need the help of sympathetic neighbors in healing their wounds and in negotiating their divisions--but what they want ultimately is the chance to shape their own course.;Those are the hopes of the Dominican people. But they are our hopes, too. And they are shared by responsible people in every nation of this hemisphere.;Out of the Dominican crucible the 20 American nations must now forge a stronger shield against disaster.;The opportunity is here now for a new thrust forward--to show the world the way to true international cooperation in the cause of peace and in the struggle to win a better life for all of us.;We believe that the new world may most wisely approach this task guided by new realities.;The first reality is that old concepts and old labels are largely obsolete. In today's world, with the enemies of freedom talking about "wars of national liberation," the old distinction between "civil war" and "international war" has already lost much of its meaning.;Second is the reality that when forces of freedom move slowly--whether on political, economic, or military fronts--the forces of slavery and subversion move rapidly, and they move decisively.;Third, we know that when a Communist group seeks to exploit misery, the entire free American system is put in deadly danger. We also know that these dangers can be found today in many of our lands. There is no trouble anywhere these evil forces will not try to turn to their advantage. We can expect more efforts at triumph by terror and conquest through chaos.;Fourth, we have learned in the Dominican Republic that we can act decisively and we can act together.;Fifth, it is clear that we need new international machinery geared to meet the fast-moving events. When hours can decide the fate of generations, the moment of decision must become the moment of action.;Just as these lessons of the past 4 weeks are clear, so are the basic principles which have guided the purpose of the United States of America.;We seek no territory. We do not seek to impose our will on anyone. We intend to work for the self-determination of the peoples of the Americas within the framework of freedom.;In times past large nations have used their power to impose their will on smaller nations. Today we have placed our forces at the disposition of the nations of this hemisphere to assure the peoples of those nations the right to exercise their own will in freedom;In accordance with the resolution of the eighth meeting of the ministers at Punta del Este, we will join with other OAS nations in opposing a Communist takeover in this hemisphere.;And in accordance with the Charter of Punta del Este, we will join with other OAS nations in pressing for change among those who would maintain a feudal system-a feudal system that denies social justice and economic progress to the ordinary peoples of this hemisphere.;We want for the peoples of this hemisphere only what they want for themselves: liberty, justice, dignity, a better life for all.;More than "a few agitators" was necessary to bring on the tragic and the cruel bloodshed in the Dominican Republic. They needed additional help and a deeper cause. And they had both.;For the roots of the trouble are found wherever the landless and the despised, the poor and the oppressed, stand before the gates of opportunity seeking entry into a brighter land.;They can get there only if we narrow the gap between the rich nations and the poor-and between the rich and the poor within each nation. And this is the heart of the purpose of the United States.;Here on the campus of Baylor University we will reaffirm that purpose on June 26 when almost 50 Peace Corps volunteers will begin training for service in the Dominican Republic. These young men and women will go to the barrios of Santo Domingo and Santiago to work with and to work for the people of the Dominican Republic in attaining a new life and a new hope.;At home, with the strong cooperation of our Congress, we are waging war on poverty, we are opening new paths of learning for all our children, we are creating new jobs for our workers, we are providing health care for our older citizens, we are eliminating injustice and inequality, we are bringing new economic life to whole regions. These objectives we will continue to pursue with all of our strength and all of our determination.;As peace returns to the Dominican people and as a broad base is laid for a new Dominican government responsive to the people's will, the United States will be prepared to join in full measure in the massive task of reconstruction and in the hopeful work of lasting economic progress.;For in bold ink our signature is on the charter of the alliance. That charter commands a peaceful democratic social revolution across the hemisphere. It asks that unjust privilege be ended and that unfair power be curbed. It asks that we help throw open the gates of opportunity to these millions who stand there now knocking.;Just as we have joined in the Dominican Republic to bring peace to a troubled land, we have joined with these forces across the hemisphere who seek to advance their own independence and their own democratic progress.;We work with and for those men and women not because we have to. We work because morality commands it, justice requires it, and our own dignity as men depends upon it. We work not because' fear the unjust wrath of our enemy, but because we fear the just wrath of God.;In Santo Domingo the last month has been grim. The storm there is not yet over. But a new sense of hope is beginning. Across the angry arguments of the opposing forces, the voice of good sense is now beginning to be heard.;As the Organization of American States recommits itself to the hard efforts of peacemaking, the Government and the people of the United States proudly pledge full support to the peacemakers.;The path ahead is long, the way ahead is hard. So we must, in the words of the prophet, "Mount up on the wings of eagles, run and not grow weary.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at the Commencement Exercises of the National Cathedral School.</td><td class="c6">June 1, 1965</td><td class="c7">Presiding Bishop Hines, Bishop Creighton, Dean Sayre, members of the faculty, members of the 1965 graduating class and their parents, families, ladies and gentlemen;The office of President presents many challenges, but I am sure that every father that is here this morning will understand sympathetically that few challenges could compare with the exacting demands of speaking before the graduating class of your own daughter.;I have been reminded repeatedly--before this morning--that in talking here I really have a family reputation to uphold. I only hope that it is not principally a reputation for talking.;For members of the class of '65, I know this is a very proud and happy and rewarding day for you. Speaking for myself, as a parent, I find this moment both sad and glad. I shall miss the small comfort of knowing that no matter how much homework I might bring to the White House every night, Luci still would have brought more from NCS. But at the same time I am glad and I am eternally grateful that by the time that she reached her junior year here at NCS Luci had learned to spell her name correctly, with an "i" instead of a "y.;Most of you here this morning will go on from here to serve your country in many ways. So this morning I want to ask your assistance in a very special way. This particular occasion will be broadcast and reported to millions of people--some in other lands. Now, this is not a tribute to me or to you, but it is a tribute to the importance of our beloved country. So this morning I would like to discuss with you and the Nation a matter which concerns me and about which I have given much thought.;FREEDOM OF DEBATE IN TIME OF DANGER As is true for most national issues, we have had much discussion here of late about the various aspects of American foreign policy. I have disagreed with some of the views that have been expressed. I know that the large majority of Americans support our country's efforts everywhere to stop aggression.;But I also know that such discussion is one of the great strengths of American democracy. How rare is the land and extraordinary the people who freely allow and really encourage, as I have on many occasions, the citizens of our Nation to discuss and to debate their Nation's policies in time of danger. So, let no citizen that is secure in his own liberty ever forget how precious it is and how brave we must be if we are to keep it, how many generations of men have perished in order to guard its light, and how many scattered throughout the world are dying still to protect it.;Our soldiers are falling in Viet-Nam. Twenty have died and more than a hundred have been wounded on guard in the Dominican Republic so that men may always rise with perfect safety to criticize and to try to influence the leadership of their government.;Nor should we forget that the purpose of liberty is not merely to allow error, but to discover truth, not only to restrict the powers of the Government, but to enrich the judgment of the Nation. So, by testing ideas in the forum of the Nation we discover their strength as well as their wisdom. As the Bible says: "Where no counsel is, the people fall: But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.;Therefore we welcome and we ask for new ideas from serious and concerned men and women, from universities and journals and public platforms all across this land. We are constantly searching for views and proposals which might strengthen and unite and help your Government. Of course, there can be no decision with which we all agree. But all will be heard.;Let no one ever think for a moment that national debate means national division. For even among those who do not support our Government policies, the very process of discussion rests on a broad and deeply set foundation of shared belief, principle, faith and experience.;There are, first of all, the assumptions of American democracy. Thus, most of those who disagree are really trying to influence the democratic process and not rip it and tear it apart. They are really seeking to exercise their own freedom and not deny it to others. They try to affect the decisions of the Nation, not flaunt or ignore them.;Secondly, even among those who quarrel with particular acts, most believe, as I believe, in the principles which have shaped American world policy now for more than a generation;We seek neither conquest nor domination.;We seek to work toward a goal where every country can run its own affairs, can shape its own progress, can build its own institutions according to that country's own desires and needs.;We do all that can be done to find enduring peace--at the same time resisting aggression by any who wish to subdue others and gobble them up and really try to destroy us.;We seek to reserve our special friendship for those governments that are dedicated to social justice and progress for all of the people--all the people, not just a privileged few.;It is these principles which I am trying so hard, as best I can, for your Government to support in every continent of the world today. Because I think these are also the beliefs of the American people. Therefore, we need never shrink from debate because debate can only strengthen our determination and our ability to follow this course. In a democracy, the people have to want to do what must be done--and that particularly includes students like you.;THE COMMITTED GENERATION I have visited many campuses and I have talked to many students, and I can tell you that this generation of young Americans is a generation of which I am deeply proud. And I think you are very lucky to be joining them.;This is not the lost generation or the silent generation or the indifferent generation. This is the concerned and the committed generation. And I, for one, believe that adult America should be proud and should be thankful that young America--youthful America--is so concerned for their country, so committed and dedicated to a genuine understanding of all of America's problems and they are uncowed in their determination to be a part of the answers that we are seeking and that we need.;A RESTLESS WORLD This world that we live in is a restless world. It is a world filled with revolution and even violence, and we must never make the sad mistake of thinking that this is only the work of our enemies. Of course, our enemies are at work like ants, constantly united and dedicated and determined. But they thrive on the desperate struggle by the poor of the world to try to create a more hopeful life.;Our life in America is good. Our land is rich. Our comforts are many. But more than 2 billion of the 3 billion people in the world have an income of less than $20 per month. Half of the world's children today have no school to go to at all and have never darkened a schoolroom. Two hundred million people in the world today have no safe water to drink any day of their lives. More than half the population of Asia and Africa and Latin America, by our standards, have no home at all in which to live.;Now this is the world that you live in and, whether you know it or not, it is a world of slums and shacks, it is a world without lights or water in the homes, it is a world without food on the shelves or health in the bodies, a world with too few teachers and too few doctors. In Viet-Nam, they have 200 doctors. And if they had the same ratio of doctors that we have in this country they would not have 200, they'd have 5,000.;So, this is a world where hope is too rare and help is too scarce. Wherever and whenever men struggle to escape this misery no nation ought to be neutral--whatever be the continent or the creed or the color of those who reach upward striving and yearning for a better life.;Were there no cold war--and no communism at all--this planet would still be wracked and seething with man's heroic battle to secure justice for himself and his loved ones.;OUR MORAL COMMITMENT For myself, I do not propose that this powerful Nation which I lead shall stand alone or shall stand apart from this most decisive struggle of our times. Concerned as I am with the future of freedom for America, concerned as I am with the world that my daughters shall know, I would commit the American Nation to face up to its obligation to be with the world's people on their march toward the life that all God's children should know on this earth.;This is not a political commitment nor even an economic commitment that we alone must make. This is a moral commitment that we have made and that we must keep in all that we do.;Look around this great cathedral. Every day men and women come here to fulfill their spiritual and their moral needs. Every day they come here to seek the blessings and the strength and the guidance of God. But as people we shall never satisfy the command of God, or the responsibilities of country, simply by coming to the houses of worship.;When the time of judgment comes, it will be no excuse to say that they were far away, or their language was strange, or their color was different, or I did not know their names.;It will be asked of you, and it will be asked of me: What did you do--you, the children of abundance--what did you do to help those who were hungry, and those who were sick, and those who were fatherless, and those who were homeless?;What did you do? You were conceived in hope, and you have been raised in opportunity, and your parents have made great sacrifices so that you could be in this place of honor today. But what did you do to brighten the promise of those who, from the moment of their birth, the moment they discovered the world, could see only the darkness of fear and insecurity and poverty.;I propose that when the day of answering comes, the American Nation and the American people shall be able to answer that we kept the trust of our abundance, that we kept the faith of our moral beliefs, because we were good and faithful servants of the ideals which we promulgated and for which we said that we stood.;You must give the hours of your life, and the fruits of your learning, and the courage of your spirit, and the substance of your home to those in need in every continent of the earth. You must, in the words of the Bible, "Let your light so shine before men that they may seek your good works.;Then only will you have earned what you have so abundantly received, as is in evidence here this morning.;Then only will you have really met your duty to your God and your country and your family, but most of all to yourself.;EDUCATION'S GREATEST GIFT To do all of these things you must prepare yourself.;You have been doing that in this school. Whether you go on to college or not you will continue your education for the rest of your life. For to stop learning, at any age, is to relapse into ignorance.;And one of the greatest satisfactions that come to me in my hours of sunshine and sorrow, and my nights of trouble, is the knowledge that my daughter, who is a part of you, has decided to spend her life healing the sick and ministering to the needs of the needy.;Yes, you are going to learn many things in the years to come, but I hope that you will remember that education's greatest gift is not just particular knowledge. Education's greatest gift is a spacious and a skeptical mind--a curious mind. It is the willingness to accept fresh ideas, even if they challenge the most cherished assumptions.;And here, I think, I can pay a very special tribute to Miss Lee and to the faculty of this great institution. Whatever else may be said about them, they do develop and instill, at least from my personal observation, a reasonable amount of independence and independent thinking among their graduates.;So, it is this ability to seek the right, to seek the right while never forgetting that you could be wrong, and that you may be wrong.;THE PRICE OF LEADERSHIP But if you are to be among those who lead and who act then even this is not enough. It is not hard to act when you know that you are right. I find it far more difficult to act when I just believe that I am right, but sometimes knowing that I could be wrong. Yet that is the burden that responsibility imposes on thought. And that is the price that leadership exacts of free men and free thinkers.;A great statesman once said that he would rather be right than President. Well, I must try to be both. I must try as best I can, with whatever the good Lord gave me and with whatever help God chooses to give me now, to seek the right course not just for myself but for you to whom I have a special responsibility, and to the Nation who relies on me.;And as President of your country I must act, in this 20th century--often swiftly, always decisively--according to judgment.;So, we will proceed with the course that we are on, glad of the overwhelming support of the American people, always open to criticism and the flow of ideas, but proceeding as we believe that we must, following the path that we believe is right, however the transient winds of opinion may blow.;This is what I believe the American people expect of their President.;And this is what they shall receive from me.;But, I guess, this is enough of such grave and weighty matters.;Recently I gave a speech, and when I came back to the White House that night my wife and my two daughters were sitting on the bed talking and reading, and I asked Lady Bird what she thought about what I had said that evening--as I will ask her when we go home this morning. She said, "Darling, you were wonderful, except you did miss several good opportunities to sit down.;Well, I will take that opportunity now. This is a shining spring day. You are all so young and beautiful, and this is a wonderful moment for me. And I think it is very nice of you sparkling, scintillating, fresh, intelligent young ladies to let a much older and a rather solemn man come here and talk to you about his problems. I hope that you know how it lifts my heart to just look at you, and to understand and to believe and to know that a little of what I will do today, and tomorrow, and the years ahead, may possibly enrich your lives and ensure peace for you and your families.;Thank you so much.</td></tr>

Johnson: Statement by the President on the Distribution of Food and Medical Supplies in the Dominican Republic.</td><td class="c6">June 1, 1965</td><td class="c7">I WANT to call your attention to the very effective and selfless emergency relief work done by representatives of our Government, in cooperation with the OAS.;From the very earliest days, we have been distributing food and medical supplies to ward off starvation and epidemic. This work has been under the very able direction of Mr. Anthony Solomon, who is being sworn in this afternoon as Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.;Under his direction we have now distributed more than 9 million pounds of food, and distribution continues at a rate of half a million pounds a day. We have given out rice, cornmeal, powdered milk, beans, and flour.;In the same way, we have provided medical supplies from U.S. Army sources in repeated shipments. They have included antibiotics and other medicines, oxygen tanks, serums for immunization, power generators for the hospitals, and surgical supplies.;Both food and medical supplies have been distributed all over the country by nine food teams of Spanish-speaking Americans working to relieve need on a straight humanitarian basis. These teams have cooperated fully with private charitable agencies like Catholic Relief, CARE, and the Church World Service. They have been subjected to harassment in about equal measure by suspicious members of both contending groups.;We have also reopened lines of fuel supply for the civilian economy--while at the same time we have resisted pressure to provide fuel for either of the contending military forces.;It is entirely natural that while the shooting continued, public attention focused heavily on the fighting. But it is time now for us all to pay tribute to the work of these peaceful representatives of our country. They have saved uncounted lives and they have taken the lead in the first steps toward the peaceful reconstruction of the Dominican Republic.</td></tr>

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.;WITHDRAWAL OF MARINES FROM THE;DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [1.] The situation in the Dominican Republic continues to be serious. That is why we welcome the additional efforts which are being made in the OAS today to enlarge and to strengthen the efforts to find a peaceful settlement there. We continue to give our full support to Secretary General Mora 1 in his outstanding service under existing OAS resolutions, but we share his judgment that a very strong and sustained effort is going to continue to be needed.;1 Jose A. Mora, Secretary General of the Organization of American States.;Meanwhile, I have been advised today by General Alvim, the Commander in Chief of the Inter-American Force, and by Lieutenant General Palmer, the Deputy Commander of the Inter-American Force, that conditions in the Dominican Republic will now permit the further withdrawal of the United States military personnel from the Inter-American Force. This recommendation has the concurrence of Secretary General Mora and Ambassador Bennett. 2;2 W. Tapley Bennett, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic.;I am, therefore, accordingly, ordering the immediate withdrawal of one battalion landing team of United States Marines, plus headquarters and supporting personnel. This will total approximately 2,000 people.;Now to another subject.;ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS [2.] This month of June marks a very historic anniversary in the affairs of man. Twenty years ago, while war still raged in the world, the nations of Europe assembled at San Francisco to sign the charter of hope that brought into being the United Nations. Men were mindful that in these times humankind must choose between cooperation or catastrophe.;At San Francisco there was brought into being a great instrumentality for international cooperation, and we can believe today that the cooperation engendered by the United Nations has helped to avert catastrophe in this century. So today we have to work not on the things that divide us, but instead on the things that unite nations in the bonds of common interest.;On June 24th, 25th, and 26th of this year, the General Assembly of the United Nations will meet for commemorative sessions in San Francisco. It is my hope and plan at this time to be in San Francisco and to address the delegates at that time during the meetings of the sessions there.;FOREIGN AID FUNDS FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA [3.] This afternoon I am sending to the Congress a very special message requesting an additional appropriation to help in the peaceful economic and social development of southeast Asia. 3 This is another forward step toward carrying out my April proposal for a massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict-torn corner of the world.;3 See Item 294.;The American people, I think, want their own Government to be not only strong but compassionate. They know that a society is secure only when there is full social justice for all of its people, and these principles of compassion and justice never stop at the water's edge.;So we do not intend that the enemies of freedom shall become the inheritors of man's worldwide revolt against injustice and misery. Therefore, we expect to lead in that struggle, not to conquer or to subdue, but to give each people the chance to build its own nation in its own way.;My personal representative, Mr. Eugene Black, 4 has already begun extensive and hopeful discussions with interested parties around the world. Thus, the groundwork has already been laid for a long-range development plan for all of southeast Asia, led by Asians, to improve the life of Asians.;4 Eugene R. Black, adviser to the President on Southeast Asian social and economic development and former President of the World Bank.;In South Viet-Nam today, brave and enduring people are carrying on a determined resistance against those who would destroy their independence. They will win this fight, and the United States of America is going to help them win it.;But there is another and a much more profound struggle going on in that country, and that is the struggle to create the conditions of hope and progress which are really the only lasting guarantees of peace and stability.;The 16 million people of South Viet-Nam survive on an average income of $100 per year. More than 60 percent of the people have never learned to read or write. When disease strikes, medical care is often impossible to find.;As I remarked the other day here, there is only one doctor for every 29,000 people, compared with one for every 740 in the United States. They have 200 doctors, whereas, they need 5,000. This poverty and this neglect take their inevitable toll in human life. The life expectancy there is only 35 years. That is just about half what it is in our country.;Now, we think that these are the common enemies of man in South Viet-Nam. They were there before the aggressor struck. They, of course, will be there when aggression is completely gone. These enemies, too, we are committed to help defeat.;Today's request will be used to help develop the vast water and power resources of the Mekong basin. They will be used to bring electricity to small towns in the provinces. We have had REA teams, as you know, there working for several weeks making these surveys and planning to build several REA systems.;We will build clinics and provide doctors for disease-ridden rural areas. We will help South Viet-Nam import materials for their homes and their factories, and in addition, the members of the American Medical Association have already agreed with us to try to recruit surgeons and specialists, approximately 50 of them. We are particularly very much in need of plastic surgeons to go to Viet-Nam to help heal the wounds of war and to help them, as well, to deal with the ravages of unchecked disease.;Now, this is just a part of the beginning. This appropriation today calls for only $89 million, but in the future I will call upon our people to make further sacrifices because this is a good program, and the starts that we are making today are good starts. This is the only way that I know in which we can really win not only the military battle against aggression, but the wider war for the freedom and for progress of all men.;Now I will be glad to take any questions you may have.;QUESTIONS;THE OAS PEACE FORCE [4.] Q. Mr. President, in your speech at Baylor on Friday, 5 you spoke of new international machinery being needed to counteract any future aggression or subversion in this hemisphere. Could you spell out in any further detail just what your concept of this is, militarily or diplomatically?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think that we are very delighted that for the first time in history, we have presently on the military side an Inter-American Force that is functioning-and functioning effectively--under the leadership of General Alvim in the Dominican Republic. A good many of the nations in this hemisphere are supplying forces to that Inter-American Force, and others will be making contributions, we hope, in the next few days.;5 See Item 286.;On the political side, we are now considering the Organization of American States' certain solutions for the Dominican Republic which could very well serve as an indication of what might come in similar situations down the road. We have had very enlightened and very positive leadership under Mr. Mora, the Secretary General of the OAS, in the Dominican Republic, and we hope not only can they supply forces to help provide the military answer to the necessities in that field, but that they can evolve a formula that will provide judicious determinations in connection with political judgments that we need to make in the near future.;U.S. EFFORTS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Q. Mr. President, could you spell out for us, sir, the efforts and role that the United States has been playing in seeking a compromise government in the Dominican Republic and what you think the chances for success are?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I will be very glad to. We found it necessary, in order to preserve our own citizens' lives, and in order to stop the wholesale killing of hundreds and even thousands of Dominicans, to intervene in the Dominican Republic. Since that time, we have counseled at great length and sought the assistance of the OAS in connection with contributing the military forces that would bring about a cease-fire and preserve the peace.;At the same time, we have urged the OAS to establish machinery to help find a political solution, and awaiting the establishment of that machinery, which we are really considering in the OAS today, we have sent some of the best people in this Government to maintain contacts with the broad base of leadership in the Dominican Republic in the hope that there would, in due time, evolve a broadly based government that would meet with the approval of the Dominican people.;I have had Mr. Vance, Mr. Bundy, Mr. Mann, Mr. Vaughn, 6 and others maintain liaison with various leaders of various groups there. Those conferences have been taking place from day to day and we have been keeping the OAS and their representatives fully informed. We are hopeful that in due time they will reach conclusions as to how they think it can be best handled and that we will be able to contribute our part and cooperate with them. As you know, they were discussing the matter over the weekend and today, and we hope that a decision will be in the offing in the immediate future.;6 Cyrus R. Vance, Deputy Secretary of Defense, McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President, Thomas C. Mann, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, and lack H. Vaughn, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs and United States Coordinator, Alliance for Progress.;We have no desire to insist upon our particular brand of military solution or political solution. We think it is an inter-American matter, and we want to cooperate fully with them. Prior to our intervention, we consulted and discussed the gravity of the situation there with 14 Latin American nations, beginning on Saturday when the revolution took place, up through Wednesday when we sent the Marines in.;During that same period, we met with the Peace Committee of the OAS on Tuesday, and we met with the OAS Council on Wednesday. It has been our desire all along to contribute all we could to a cease-fire, to the eventual evolution of a stable government that would be broadly based, and to make our appropriate contribution to the necessary reconstruction of that country.;We feel that when the OAS reaches its decision, that that decision will be communicated to the people of the Dominican Republic. We hope that they will be able to find agreement between the inter-American body and the folks there that will ultimately lead to an expression of opinion by the people of the Dominican Republic and ultimately lead to a broadly based government that will include none of the extremes.;MAYOR WAGNER'S CANDIDACY [5.] Q. Mr. President, do you feel Mayor Wagner 7 should run again?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that is a matter not for the President to determine.;7 Robert F. Wagner, Mayor of New York City.;THE OAS SECRETARY GENERAL [6.] Q. Mr. President, do you think that the attacks which have been made on OAS Secretary General Mora in the Dominican Republic may have undermined his usefulness as a peace negotiator?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't think so. I think it may have had that objective in mind. That may have been its purpose. But you know the old story--when a man gets in the role of a mediator, both sides usually hit at him. But we think, as I said in my opening statement, that the Secretary General has performed a very useful role, a very intelligent one, and a very objective one, and we have every confidence in his efforts. We have regretted to see the attacks come upon him as we have regretted to see the attacks come upon us. But we much prefer the attacks to what could have happened except for our action and except for his action.;FREEDOM OF SPEECH [7.] Q. Mr. President, this morning, sir, you said "We welcome and ask for new ideas in foreign policy from universities and journals and public platforms across the land." Two questions, sir: Does this mean you approve of the university teach-in techniques, and what is your view of dissenting comment on Viet-Nam and other foreign problems?;THE PRESIDENT. I will answer the latter question first. I think that this administration profits from the suggestions and recommendations of leaders in other branches of government, from men who occupy public platforms, from general discussions. I think that is the strength of the American system, instead of a weakness. I am hopeful that every person will always exercise the free speech that the Constitution guarantees him, and I would prefer, of course, that it be constructive and it be responsible, and I think generally that has been true.;I am glad that I live in a nation where, in the midst of conflict, when men are dying to preserve our freedom, that our citizens still do not fear to exercise it, and I can assure you that they do exercise it.;INCREASED ACTION IN VIET-NAM [8.] Q. Mr. President, there has been a flare-up of the fighting in Viet-Nam. Could you give us an estimate of the situation there, the military situation?;THE PRESIDENT. We had anticipated that we would have some actions of this type at this season of the year. We have had a rather serious engagement in the last few hours, in the most immediate past. The South Vietnamese have lost, according to the reports we have, dozens, even hundreds, of people.;We do not know exactly the extent of the Viet Cong losses, although we believe them to be substantial. We do not announce those, perhaps unfortunately, along with the announcement of our own losses. We know how many we lose, but we don't know how many they lose until we get out there and count them, so their losses never really catch up with the original story of our losses.;Suffice it to say I think it has been serious. We are concerned about it. It is occupying our attention. As you know, General Taylor 8 plans to be here in the next few days and he will probably have more definite information at that time, just about the details of this particular engagement.;8 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, U.S. Ambassador to;COMMUNIST THREAT IN THE DOMINICAN;REPUBLIC [9.] Q. Mr. President, sir, last month when you spoke to the Nation on the Dominican Republic, you indicated that the threat of Communist control of the rebel movement was very serious. More recently we have included the rebel leaders in these talks for coalition. Do you feel that the Communist threat in the Dominican Republic is now over?;THE PRESIDENT. Oh, no. If you want me to elaborate on that a little bit, I will say that the threat was greater before 21,000 Americans arrived there. It always is. The Communists did not, in our judgment, originate this revolution, but they joined it and South Viet-Nam. they participated in it. They were active in it, and in a good many places they were in charge of it.;We think that following the action that this Nation took--it served a very good purpose and some of the men who had originally participated in the revolution, and had to take asylum, returned, and more moderate forces took leadership--the Communist elements have not been so active, although their presence is still noted hour by hour. Their effectiveness is still observed. From day to day we see their handiwork in the Dominican Republic and elsewhere throughout the world, particularly in the propaganda field.;REGIONAL PEACE FORCES [10.] Q. Mr. President, do you foresee that an inter-American peace force which may be set up permanently would be used only to suppress Communist-directed revolutionary movements in Latin America, or would it also be used to thwart revolutions by military juntas which were attempting to destroy elected governments?;I would also like to ask, in view of the precedent which may be created by such a force, would you look with favor upon the creation of similar regional forces in such areas as Africa and the Arab world?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not want to anticipate what action the OAS is going to take.;REAPPORTIONMENT [11.] Q. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court handed down several decisions in reapportionment cases in line with its doctrine of "One man, one vote." However, as you know, there are several proposals already introduced in Congress for constitutional amendments which would nullify this doctrine in part. Could you tell us what your administration's position is on this legislation?;THE PRESIDENT. The President does not take action in connection with constitutional amendments. I have reviewed some of the proposals that have been made. I am generally sympathetic with the reapportionments taking place throughout the country in compliance with the Supreme Court's decision. I would not want to get into detailed discussion of the individual programs about which the President will not act one way or the other, because a constitutional amendment does not require White House action. It is a matter for the representatives of the people to decide.;In submitting it, the Congress takes that action. The people themselves have an opportunity to judge it. When the Congress does get down to debating the question and considering it, I will, of course, spend some time on it and become thoroughly conversant with it, but I wouldn't want to predict at this time just what measure would emerge in the form of an amendment or what action Congress or the people might take on it.;FORTHCOMING GEMINI FLIGHT [12.] Q. Mr. President, the astronaut flight on Thursday is going to have more maneuvering than was originally announced. Was this increase done at your suggestion or urging, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;VIET-NAM [13.] Q. Mr. President, if the situation in Viet-Nam--in which you have promised the United States to help that country achieve victory--becomes such that American combat troops are used in the combat there, would you give that order, sir, in the event that there was an invasion from the north?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't see that I can do you any good, the country any good, or myself any good by discussing future operational plans. I know of no real reason why we ought to photograph them or decide them until we are confronted with that possibility.;REGIONAL PEACE FORCES [14.] Q. Mr. President, in connection with your statement on the United Nations, the Secretary General of the U.N. has expressed the apprehension that the OAS action in the Dominican Republic might have established, I think, what he called an embarrassing precedent, that the Arab League might act in its region and the African states might act in theirs. I was wondering whether you shared those apprehensions about the U.N.?;THE PRESIDENT. I do not.;THE "JOHNSON DOCTRINE" [15.] Q. Mr. President, some persons claim that you have enunciated a new Johnson doctrine under which American troops would be used to prevent the establishment of a Communist government anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. In sending American troops to Santo Domingo and explaining your actions afterwards, did you have any such purpose in mind?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I am afraid that the people that have branded the Johnson doctrine were unfamiliar with the fact that the nations of this hemisphere have repeatedly made it clear that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of the inter-American system, just as President Kennedy made it abundantly clear. That is the basis of our own attitude on the matter, as I explained in my television appearance.;That does not mean, of course, that this Government is opposed to change. The greatest purpose of the Alliance for Progress, which we are working on so hard and making such substantial contributions to, is to encourage economic and social change. We believe that will benefit all the people of this hemisphere. We are doing our best to provide encouragement for those changes. But I think it is a well-known and well-advertised doctrine of the hemisphere that the principles of communism are incompatible with the principles of our inter-American system. President Kennedy enunciated that on several occasions. The OAS itself has enunciated that. I merely repeated it. I am sorry I got some folks excited by it.;THE DECISION TO INTERVENE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [16.] Q. Mr. President, I would like to ask you two questions about the Dominican rebellion, one dealing with its origin and one dealing with the possible future. Do you think that it would have been helpful if Juan Bosch 9 had returned, and do you think he might have exercised a restraining influence on some of the left-wing extremists, or Communists, who are in there? And secondly--;THE PRESIDENT. I will answer your first one. I don't want to get into personalities. Go ahead.;9 Former President of the Dominican Republic.;Q. On the second one regarding the future, do you think it would be useful if the Dominicans were to follow the example of the Founding Fathers in this country and hold a constitutional convention themselves to talk out some of their differences before they try to set up a new government?;THE PRESIDENT. We have taken several steps in the order of priority that we felt was required. Many months ago we became aware of the increasing tensions there, and the difficulties that would likely confront us. On the Sunday before we went in there on Wednesday, we asked the Ambassador, who had already come to Washington at our calling, to leave his family's home and come here to meet with us.;Ambassador Bennett met with us on Monday. We rushed him back to the Dominican Republic and set in motion certain steps.;First, was to attempt to obtain a cease-fire. Second, was to take the precautionary steps necessary to protect approximately 5,000 Americans, as well as thousands of other nationals, if that should be required. We moved our ships up there on Sunday.;The Ambassador arrived there on Monday. He talked to various leaders. We did all we could to bring about a cease-fire in cooperation with the Papal Nuncio and others who were active on the scene. On Wednesday at noon it became apparent that danger was lurking around the corner and the Ambassador gave us a warning in a cable about 1 o'clock.;We had met on Monday and we had met on Tuesday. We had met on Wednesday and we had had many conversations on Sunday that we did not issue any handouts on. During that period, I think from the time we were notified on Saturday, until we intervened on Wednesday, we spent a good part of both day and night giving our attention to this matter, from moving the ships up to making the final decision.;I had 237 individual conversations during that period and about 35 meetings with various people. Finally, on Wednesday afternoon at 4-something, we got another warning that we should have a contingent plan ready immediately, and a little before 6 o'clock we got a plea, a unanimous plea from the entire country team, made up of the Ambassador, the AID Director, CIA and the USIA, and the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, to land troops immediately to save American lives.;Now, of course, we knew of the forces at work in the Dominican Republic. We were not unaware that there were Communists that were active in this effort, but 99 percent of our reason for going in there was to try to provide protection for these American lives and for the lives of other nationals. We asked our Ambassador to summon all our people immediately to the Ambassador Hotel, to put them in one central group. In the presence of Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, Secretary Ball, 10 Mr. Bundy, and Mr. Moyers 11 of my staff, we consulted with the Latin American desk, Mr. Vaughn and his experts, and Mr. Vance and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.;10 George W. Ball, Under Secretary of State.;11 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President.;In the neighborhood of 6 o'clock Wednesday evening we made the decision, it was a unanimous decision, about which there was no difference of opinion either at the Dominican Republic level, or the country team, or the Cabinet level here, to send in the troops. We did not want to announce that they were on their way until they had landed, for obvious security reasons. But when I made the decision, I pointed out to the Secretary of State that we had been consulting since the weekend with some 14 Latin American nations, that we had had a meeting of the Peace Committee of the OAS, and we had had a meeting of the Council of the OAS. I thought it was very important that we notify all the Latin American Ambassadors forthwith.;So the decision was to notify the Congress and ask them to come down so we could review with them developments, notify the Ambassadors, and ask for an immediate session of the OAS, and to notify the troops, because the lives of our citizens were in danger.;Men were running up and down the corridors of the Ambassador Hotel with tommy-guns, shooting out windows, and through the roof and through the closets. Our citizens were under the beds and in the closets and trying to dodge this gunfire. Our Ambassador, as he was talking to us, was under the desk. We didn't think we had much time to consult in any great detail more than we had talked about up to that time, but we did make the announcement about 8 o'clock and immediately asked the OAS for an urgent meeting the next morning.;Since that time we have had two purposes in mind: One was for them to take action that would give us a military presence and provide a military solution so that we could quit killing people. I think that the Armed Forces are entitled to one of the greatest tributes ever paid that group in war or peace for the marvelous operation they conducted. They moved in there and landed within an hour from the time the Commander in Chief made the decision. They surrounded the hotel and protected the lives of a thousand American citizens and many hundreds of other nationals. They did not lose one civilian. They opened the route of 7 miles to the port and they evacuated 5,600 people. Those people came from 46 different countries.;The next step that we thought should be followed was to provide food and clothing and sustenance for those people, so we sent an economic team of 32 people, headed by Mr. Solomon, 12 who was sworn in today as Assistant Under Secretary of State in charge of economic matters. And we started feeding the 3Ѕ million people of the Dominican Republic. We have provided food and other necessities, medicine, since that time, to those people without regard to which side they were on.;12 Anthony M. Solomon, Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.;In addition, we have treated more than 15,000 with our medical facilities.;So having gone in and secured the place, having evacuated 5,600 people, and now the commercial planes are running and they can come out on their own stint, having obtained a cease-fire, having provided the economic aid, having sent our best people there to talk to all groups and all factions and leadership, to try to find a government that would appeal to all the Dominican people, we now think that there are two essential things that are left to be done: One is to find a broadly based government under the leadership of the OAS that will be acceptable and approved by the Dominican people, and second, to engage in the comprehensive task of reconstruction of that nation, in trying to make it possible for 3 1/2 million to have an economic comeback.;ALVIN SPINAK(United Press International): Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks in Chicago at the Cook County Democratic Party Dinner.</td><td class="c6">June 3, 1965</td><td class="c7">Mr. Chairman, my old friend, the brave and valiant Governor of Illinois, Otto Kerner, my longtime devoted friend and as great a political leader and city administrator as there is in this world, your great mayor, Dick Daley, one of my great counselors, my former colleague, the conscience of the United States Senate, who speaks not just/or Illinois but speaks for the entire United States, your fighting Marine, Senator Paul Douglas, Members of one of the Congress' most valued and effective delegations, the men who served Cook County in the House of Representatives, Congressman Bill Dawson, Congressman Bill Murphy, Congressman John Kluczynski, Congressman Frank, Annunzio, Congressman Danny Rostenkowski, Congressman Sid Yates, Congressman Roman Pucinski;I am very proud that all of you are here tonight. I am prouder still that you stayed in Washington to pass our reorganization bill before you came.;My fellow countrymen;I am constantly reminded that Chicago is the center of our country. When Dick Daley isn't reenforcing that thought, Otto Kerner and Paul Douglas are.;What a magnificently beautiful setting this is here tonight and how lovely, how truly lovely is this great city of Chicago which belongs to your This is a great party. Actually I really like small parties. As a matter of fact, I told Senator Everett Dirksen the other day how partial I was to small parties and I pointed out to him that his party was just about the size I like to see it.;But on this occasion, honoring the founders of our party--Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson--no words of ours could be so eloquent as their own expressions about each other. When Thomas Jefferson was asked what he thought of Jackson as a prospect for President, Jefferson replied without hesitation, "He is one of the most unfit men I know of for such a place." What "Old Hickory" said of Jefferson cannot be repeated in Cook County.;Needless to say I am glad to be here in Cook County where I am sure the Democrats never talk that way about each other.;Well, there is always a time and a place for party talk. I do not believe that this is an appropriate place tonight for partisanship. I say to you in Illinois what Woodrow Wilson said 50 years ago in Indiana: I love the Democratic Party but I love America a great deal more. And what difference does party make when mankind is involved?;Well, mankind is involved in every decision that will be waiting on my desk when I return to the White House tonight. America does not need, and I am confident Democrats do not want, a President who would ever allow those decisions to be influenced by considerations of party.;That is why I want to speak, not about partisanship or party tonight, but about what matters most to us all--the peace of mankind.;On this subject I believe there is a need now for plain speaking.;In this city of Chicago, 28 years ago, a President of these United States then described the condition of the world in these words;Without a declaration of war and without warning or justification of any kind, civilians, including vast numbers of women and children, are being ruthlessly murdered... ships are being attacked... without cause or without notice. Nations are fomenting and taking sides in civil warfare in nations that have never done them any harm.... Innocent peoples, innocent nations, are being cruelly sacrificed to a greed for power and supremacy which is devoid of all sense of justice and human considerations.;The world did not heed the vision or the wisdom of Franklin D. Roosevelt when he called upon all peace-loving nations to join together to quarantine the aggressors. And those who loved peace above all else, lost their peace and all else.;That history need not--and that history must not--be allowed to repeat its full course again in our time.;The peace of mankind must not, and will not, be lost again.;If similarities are many between the worlds of 1937 and 1965, the differences are far more numerous. The peace-loving nations are not weak now as they were then-not lacking in will now as they were then.;Educated in the adversity of a great war, tested in the trial of continuing danger, united in the face of ever-present peril, the peace-loving peoples have built strength in the 1960's that they never had in the 1930's.;That strength has one unmistakable meaning. For aggression there is no prize. At the end of the road of conquest, the only sure reward is sure ruin.;For 20 years we have applied what Abraham Lincoln said would be the great lesson of peace;Teaching men that what they cannot take by an election, neither can they take by war, teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war.;But there are other differences, too, between 1937 and tonight in 1965. The people of Communist countries are somewhat wiser, too. While their leaders have chosen to close a curtain about them to keep out knowledge of the free world's peaceful intention, the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe really know, above all other peoples on this earth, what the cost and the catastrophe is to their homeland of 20th century warfare.;The men and women of Russia, the men and women of all the nations of Eastern Europe, I believe want peace and want the taste of its sweet fruits. And none want them to have peace more than do we, the people of the United States of America.;Between the great powers of East and West, there is no history of conflict on the battlefields of the past. Between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the United States, there has been friendship and there can be greater understanding.;The common interests of the peoples of Russia and the peoples of the United States are many--and this I would say to the people of the Soviet Union tonight: There is no American interest in conflict with the Soviet people anywhere. And no true Soviet interest is going to be served by the support of aggression or subversion anywhere in the world. We of the United States of America stand ready tonight, as always, to go with you onto the fields of peace--to plow new furrows, to plant new seed, to tend new growth--so that we and so that all mankind may some day share together a new and a bountiful harvest of happiness and hope on this earth.;Jefferson said of Americans: "Peace is our passion.;And I say to you here in Chicago tonight-peace is our passion still.;In this Union, in this hemisphere, in every region of this world, in every forum of nations, the United States is working for peace--and that work will never cease.;But as I have spoken to Communist countries, let me also tonight speak to the free world.;I carry in my pocket--and I often read to those who visit the White House--some wise words that were written by a man of peace, the late Secretary General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjold. The words are these;The qualities that peace requires are those which I believe we all need today-perseverance and patience, a firm grip on realities, careful but imaginative planning, a clear awareness of the dangers--but also of the fact that fate is what we make it.;In the 1930's, we made our fate not by what we did but what we Americans failed to do. We propelled ourselves--and all mankind--toward tragedy, not by decisiveness but by vacillation, not by determination and resolution but by hesitancy and irresolution, not by action but by inaction.;The failure of free men in the 1930's was not of the sword but of the soul--and there just must be no such failure in the 1960's.;So, let us not delude ourselves again by the belief that peace can be secured by submissiveness or peace can be extended by expediency.;Let us not adopt again the arrogance that peace is less important to the peoples of less important countries because they are distant or different from our own.;Let us not return again to the impulsiveness which accepts as safe every promise of peace from the enemies of peace and rejects as dangerous every proposal for strength from its friends.;Persevering and patient, firmly gripping realities, proceeding in clear awareness of the dangers, let us proceed with the careful but the imaginative planning that is necessary to assure peace and justice and progress for all the peoples of the earth.;This is the course that we of the United States have chosen--and this is the course that we shall faithfully hold--for we believe that this course leads to peace in the world.;Let me make it clear to all here and all listening in other parts of the world, that the United States seeks dominion over no people. Everywhere in the world we, the United States, seek decency for all.;Out among the earth's peoples, Americans are working tonight--as few peoples have ever worked before--to bring learning and light and health and housing and hope to the family of man. Food from our fields is feeding 100 million people--including 70 million children. Medicine from our laboratories is saving the lives of many millions more. And I dare say there is not one citizen present here tonight who would have his country conduct its course otherwise.;George Washington once told us that we would have one option;Whether (to) be respectable and prosperous or contemptible and miserable as a nation?;Today, we are prosperous, as the able Senator Douglas told you, more prosperous than any other nation in all the history of man. We have enjoyed 51 consecutive months of economic expansion--the longest ever known in any peacetime and the end is not yet in sight.;Our people are happy. They are prospering. They are moving on and on, and upward. Just last year the number of families living on less than $3,000 income decreased by 18 percent, and the number of families with more than $10,000 income per year increased by 22 percent.;But I must remind you that money is no measure of the moral force at work among Americans today.;For we are committed--by a broad and a broadening consensus--to bringing brightness into lives where darkness dwells. We are committed to opening beauty to lives that are closed over by ugliness and guaranteeing the rights that God gave them to those man had forgotten.;The consensus within America tonight is a consensus of courage--and let none abroad believe that this consensus stops at the water's edge. For there is in our beloved America a consensus--a strong and a deep and an abiding majority consensus--that the world shall not walk again the road to darkness that led mankind into the valley of war 30 years ago.;The united will of the American people is itself the ultimate and the most profound difference between 1937 and 1965, and let neither friends of peace--or foes--underestimate the meaning of that unity.;The American people want to be a part of no war. But the American people want no part of appeasement or of any aggression.;Over the years of our history our forces have gone forth into many lands, but always they returned when they are no longer needed. For the purpose of America is never to suppress liberty but always to save it. The purpose of America is never to take freedom but always to return it, never to breach peace but to bolster it, and never to seize land but always to save lives.;One month ago it became my duty to send our Marines into the Dominican Republic and I sent them for these same ends.;I have been informed tonight by the Commander in Chief of the Inter-American Forces, General Alvim, and the Deputy Commander, Lieutenant General Palmer, that conditions in the Dominican Republic now permit further reductions of our military personnel. I am therefore ordering the withdrawal of all remaining units of the United States Marine Corps totaling approximately 2,100 men.;America's purpose is--and always will be--to serve the peace of mankind.;Let me say this to you: A man does what he must--in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures-and that is the basis of all human morality.;Those words are not mine. They were written by the man whose great steps I follow-John Fitzgerald Kennedy. But I would want you to know that it is that spirit which guides me in all that I do.;For men, as for nations, the way of the peacemaker is never an easy way.;While all men hate war, they too often hate still more the discipline and the duty and the demands of acting to preserve the peace that they love. I am certain that this generation of Americans is willing to accept demands that are stern in order to enjoy a world that is safe.;For we know--as all men must know wherever they live--that after losing peace twice in this century, mankind just must not lose that peace again, and it is the united will of all the people of our beloved America that it shall not be lost.</td></tr>

The President and the Chancellor also agreed on the continuing importance of maintaining an intimate and dynamic Alliance.;The Chancellor welcomed the President's assurance that the United States would maintain its forces in Europe, backed by nuclear power, so long as they were wanted and needed for the peace and security of Europe.;The Chancellor emphasized Germany's vital interest in the continued progress of European unity. And the President, in turn, agreed that European unity was an important factor in the strengthening of the Alliance. The President also expressed his appreciation for the Federal Government's effort to further European economic integration and to contribute to the development of increasingly closer economic ties between Europe and America and the rest of the world.;The Chancellor told the President of his appreciation for the President's strong support to efforts to resolve the German problem. The President and the Chancellor agreed that their governments, together with the other responsible powers, must continue to seek all available means to end the unjust division of Germany as soon as possible.;They agreed too that improvements in relations with the countries of Eastern Europe would help to contribute to peace and security and that a common allied policy would contribute to this end.;The President and the Chancellor also discussed the serious threats to peace and stability in a number of other areas of the world, and especially in southeast Asia. In this connection, the Chancellor emphasized the importance of mutual solidarity in dealing with communist aggression. He told the President his support for the American determination to turn back aggression in Viet-Nam and welcomed the United States Government's efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of that conflict. The Chancellor also told the President of his interest in the projected Asian Development Bank and the German Government's desire to participate in it and also provide economic assistance which would contribute to the establishment of political and economic stability in this area of the world.;The President and the Chancellor also expressed their hope for continuing progress in the Dominican Republic, leading to the restoration of peace and representative government there.;Finally the President and the Chancellor reaffirmed the strong and close friendship of their peoples and governments, working together for peace and freedom in the future as they have in the past. For this reason, they agreed to meet regularly and to discuss questions of common interest.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">June 17, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. [1.] I had some announcements that I thought would be of interest to you, and some of them are going to take some time. We normally take from 12 to 15 minutes on our announcements, 80 what I thought we'd do would be to just go ahead and make all the announcements and we'll send them to the mimeograph and have them made available to you as soon as possible. And then we'll reserve 20 minutes for questioning afterwards, and we'll depend on AP or UP here to tell us when that 20 minutes is up, if that is agreeable to all of you. If none of you have any suggestions, what I plan to do is read these announcements, and as I read them, send them to the mimeograph. And if you prefer any other way I'd be glad to do it.;The Vice President has been talking to me about the developments on the Hill, the legislative program he's working on, some agriculture legislation--now in the Fish Room with a number of people. The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission has been here discussing a variety of matters with me. I'll refer to those a little bit later.;Q. Sir, we don't hear a word.;THE PRESIDENT. The Vice President has been here--now can you hear me?"discussing some legislative matters with me. He has been in the Fish Room working on an agricultural message with various interested parties--and various would include Members of Congress, and departmental members, and agriculture people, and others-some items on the cotton bill. He has also reported to me on certain legislative developments and targets. We'll have a meeting of the leadership, if it is convenient with them, in the early part of the week, at which time we will review our remaining legislation and look at the dates that they have it targeted for.;DEPARTMENT OF URBAN AFFAIRS [2.] We have some very good news from Capitol Hill in the last few days--in a variety of fields.;I was especially gratified by the action of the House yesterday in giving approval to the legislation establishing departmental status for urban affairs. I hope, and I believe, that the Senate will act favorably. The vote in the House was impressive and decisive, and exceeded our expectations. I believe it reflects the realization throughout the land that our cities constitute the decisive challenge of these last decades of the 20th century.;By the year 2000 we estimate that approximately 80 percent of our people will be living in urban areas, so we must meet the needs of the cities because the cities are really the homes for most of our people. What our country is to mean for most Americans, therefore, depends upon the quality of life in our cities.;This is a long and a historic step forward. I congratulate the House on this forward-looking action in support of building a better America for all of our people, and I communicated my thanks and appreciation to the leadership of the House and asked them to express that view to the Members that supported the legislation.;EXCISE TAX REDUCTION [3.] Another subject. I am pleased that the Congress has now completed action on the reduction of excise taxes. The bill remains to be enrolled, and there are certain steps that you take before a bill is sent to the President. But we expect to get it later in the week. After we get it, we will have it reviewed by the experts and the Budget and the Treasury, and any other agencies that could be concerned with it, and collect their recommendations. After we get those recommendations and read them we'll take action. 1 I think it is safe to predict it will not be a veto, in light of what I said this morning.;1 The Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965 was approved by the President on June 21, 1965 (see Item 326).;This bill will realize about $1 3/4 billion extra purchasing power in the economy for the rest of 1965, and another $1 3/4 billion on top of that beginning next January. The bill itself is a little over $4 billion and adds to the $14 billion tax reduction last year, totaling something over $18 billion.;Under the bill, consumers will no longer be paying this $4 billion into the Federal Treasury, and will have it to spend instead on the products of our farms and factories.;It will help maintain the steady growth of jobs and production that are the mark of a healthy economy.;It will extend the string of production gains that the Federal Reserve Board announced yesterday--gains that have brought our total industrial production rate more than 7 1/2 percent above a year ago.;It will support the continuing growth of our economy that has already served us so well for the record-breaking 52 months. It will maintain stability of prices.;Yesterday, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers announced that the Council, and the Treasury, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics initiated some time ago a study of the impact of excise tax reduction on prices. I am sure the study will show that businesses throughout the Nation have passed along to consumers in lower prices the tax reductions that the Congress enacted.;CEASE-FIRE VIOLATIONS IN THE DOMINICAN;REPUBLIC [4.] In the Dominican Republic in the last 2 days there has been renewed, and repeated, and totally unjustified firing on the Inter-American Force. This is in flagrant violation of a cease-fire.;This firing has been accepted without reply by the Inter-American Force for periods up to one-half hour before the necessary replies were given under the orders of General Alvim of Brazil and General Palmer of the United States. 2 In these actions 3 of our fellow Americans have lost their lives, and 37 more Americans and 5 Brazilians have been wounded.;2 General of the Army Hugo Panasco Alvim of.Brazil, Commander of the OAS Inter-American Force m the Dominican Republic, and Lt. Gen. Bruce Palmer, Jr., of the United States, Deputy Commander.;These unprovoked attacks on the Inter-American Force appear to have been premeditated by elements which seek to prevent the establishment of peace in Santo Domingo. Our forces there have no other mission, and they will continue to observe the same soldierly restraint that they have shown now for more than 7 weeks, in the face of more than 900 cease-fire violations, and they have already suffered almost 200 casualties.;ATOMIC ENERGY PROGRAMS [5.] Dr. Seaborg 3 and I talked about the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards system and nonproliferation. At present, facilities in 15 countries are being inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. I believe we should do everything we can to point out the important contributions to nonproliferation and the world's peace that the International Atomic Energy Agency is making. And I plan to make further reference to that in a speech that I now have in the works.;3 Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.;We discussed the progress report on nuclear power and the nuclear powerplants that are being selected by American utilities because of economic considerations alone. About 20 utilities are considering such large plants and several are on the verge of announcing their orders. The Commissioner estimates that 5,000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity by 1970, and 70,000 megawatts by 1980 seems reasonable.;The AEC and Department of Interior program on desalting also seems very promising. I have directed him, today, to undertake a new study in connection with the associated Government agencies, particularly Interior, in connection with certain cooperative efforts-that I expect to announce at a later date with other nations--in the field of desalting in an attempt to make the deserts bloom.;We discussed the United States and U.S.S.R. exchanges in atomic energy in some detail. This program is making a very effective and very positive contribution to the U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. Dr. Seaborg reports that Ambassador Kohler has emphasized to us the great value of this program. As you know, he is our Ambassador in Russia. Dr. Seaborg stated that during his visit to the Soviet Union in May 1963 his counterpart, Chairman Petrosyants, 4 and Dr. Seaborg signed a memorandum of understanding in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, which has since provided us numerous scientific exchanges.;4 Andronik M. Petrosyants, Chairman, State Committee for Use of Atomic Energy in Soviet Union.;We are hopeful and we are going to labor to the end that the scientists become a bridge between nations of differing philosophies in the hope that we can bring about, through their efforts, much better understanding.;In the last 2 years, four U.S. teams have visited the U.S.S.R. Those teams are made up of 7 to 10 men each. And four Soviet teams visited the U.S. on a reciprocal basis. Three American scientists have been sent to the U.S.S.R. on an extended basis, and reciprocally three Soviet scientists have come here to the U.S. The success of this program has furthered our hope that science can serve as a common ground between East and West even in these troubled times.;You now have a mission there, don't you?;DR. SEABORG. Yes.;THE PRESIDENT. How many men?;DR. SEABORG. We have a couple of scientists working there on a long-term basis in one of the labs. The last team was a Soviet team that came to this country just last week. That is a team of 10 scientists in the field of radioactive waste disposal.;REDUCTION IN BUDGET DEFICIT [6.] THE PRESIDENT. This one I'll go a little slow on. Earlier this year I announced to you that our expanding economy would produce more revenues than we had anticipated in our prediction to Congress in the January budget.;I also announced that the drive to keep Federal expenditures under tight rein would reduce expenditures below the estimates we made in January. We do not have any final figures for June, but I do have a final, rather strong, memorandum to all the agencies about this June spending. And on the basis of the reductions we were able to make in June spending last year, and the best estimates that the career men and Budget can make today, we want to report that our progress on both fronts is much better than we had previously expected, according to Mr. Schultze, 5 of the Budget Bureau, and the Secretary of the Treasury.;5 Charles L. Schultze, Director of the Bureau of the Budget.;Instead of revenues increasing by $1.4 billion above our budget estimate, as it appeared earlier, we now anticipate a $1.6 billion revenue improvement. Our latest reports also indicate that expenditures will be in the neighborhood of $900 million lower than our January estimate. So, we expect to have a very unique thing happen to us--at present, taking in $1.6 billion more than we said we would, and spending in the neighborhood of $900 million less than we said we would spend. That will make a difference of $2.5 billion.;Now, as a result, we expect revenues to be $92.8 billion and expenditures $96.6 billion. This could be off a hundred or so million either way, but this is the estimate they make, and they have been very good on it and this is the middle of June. The budget deficit, therefore, will be only $3.8 billion, which is $2.5 billion less than the $6.3 billion estimated in our January budget.;REDUCTION IN UNEMPLOYMENT [7.] Continuing improvement in the Nation's economy has now, today, reduced to 22 the number of major manpower centers classified by the Federal Government as having substantial unemployment. The figure is the lowest since May of 1957. There were 39 such areas at this time last year, and 101 such areas in March and April of 1961.;Last month's data on employment and unemployment collected in the Nation's 150 largest manpower centers has resulted in our reclassification of 16 areas to categories denoting lower unemployment. Fifteen of these were removed from categories of substantial unemployment and were redesignated as areas of relatively low or moderate unemployment.;The Governor of Georgia told me that before they were acting on requests for new facilities they were making very careful studies because their unemployment rate is down in a good many areas 2 percent or less. Now before people come in and make surveys they try to bring them up to date. I just add that parenthetically. This is what he told me arriving at the airport yesterday.;The improved conditions can be credited to the effects of Federal programs of tax reduction, manpower training, area development, cooperation and trust and confidence between employees and business and labor and Government, in addition to the general improvement in the economic climate and the strong confidence existing in the business community, so far as new plant investments are concerned.;BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFICIT [8.] Another item is in connection with our voluntary cooperation program to control and reduce the balance of payments deficit. Many cooperating bankers and businessmen have asked what the Federal Government is doing for its part in the program. I have reviewed with the Secretary of the Treasury, and night before last with the Secretary of Commerce, and I will meet with Mr. Robertson of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr. Maisel, a Federal Reserve Board member, 6 tomorrow. We don't want to be overoptimistic, and we want to caution everyone to be prudent in their predictions. We are pleased with the balance of payments and it is exceeding our expectations. But these bankers and businessmen that I was speaking about--their concern is quite proper.;6 J. L. Robertson and Sherman J. Maisel, members, Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System.;I have just received a report from the Budget Director today on the matter and here is what it shows. The net balance of payments costs of the Federal program-that is just Federal, what I said a moment ago has to do with banks alone, capital investments by business--this has to do with Federal programs. The net balance of payments costs of Federal programs through regular transactions abroad--keeping our troops there, Korea, Germany, our headquarters in France, and our foreign aid to all the countries--through regular transactions abroad declined 23 percent, or $635 million from fiscal 1963 to 1965.;According to present plans, these costs will decline another 13 percent, or $290 additional million, by 1967.;We have certain actions and decisions that have already been made but have to be tapered out. This major improvement has been possible because of efforts throughout the Government to reduce overseas dollar payments and to increase our receipts from abroad. The most substantial contribution to date has resulted from a reduction in overseas payments of $720 million from 1963 through 1965. In the next 2 years our receipts from abroad--loan repayments, receipts from the sale of Government-owned agricultural commodities, and even advance repayments on loans made since World War II, and we hope some of these days some from World War I--will increase sharply.;These we welcome gladly, and some of them are coming back, and some are coming back in advance, and that is what reduced this 23 percent and 13 percent. So, these contributions of Federal agencies toward sharing the burden of reducing the balance of payments deficit were also reflected in the reduction in Federal employment in foreign countries. As I reported several weeks ago, there were 8,614 fewer civilian Federal employees overseas in December 1964 than a year earlier--approximately 9,000 reduced.;These improvements have been obtained without sacrificing essential U.S. commitments abroad, and in the face of rising price and wage levels in most overseas countries where we spend our dollars.;REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF GOVERNMENT;EMPLOYEES [9.] Employment last month, I believe, is down something like over 4,000 employees in the Federal Government. I'll get those exact figures if Bill Moyers, 7 or someone else, will get them for me. That is contrasted with 2.1 million more people working this May than worked last May.;7 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the president.;RESIGNATIONS AND APPOINTMENTS [10.] I have today accepted the resignation of Secretary of the Army, Stephen Ailes, effective July 1st. I plan to nominate Stanley R. Resor, currently Under Secretary of the Army, to replace Mr. Ailes as Secretary of the Army. Mr. David E. McGiffert, currently Assistant Secretary of Defense, will replace Mr. Resor as Under Secretary of the Army. Secretary Ailes served as Under Secretary of the Army from February 9, 1961, until January 28, 1964, when he succeeded Cyrus Vance as Secretary of the Army. He has served in that post continuously since that time. Secretary Ailes is returning to his Washington law practice.;I have spent a good portion of my time in the last few days going back and forth-yesterday to Georgia, and other places, reading reports and evaluating employees. I expect to have some today when it is convenient to give you a number of other appointees. We are having changes from time to time. There will be more in the Defense Department. There will be a good many in the Justice Department. Some on commissions. We are in good shape with our appointees but we have a dozen or so now under active consideration.;[11.] I have today accepted the resignation of Under Secretary of the Navy, Kenneth E. BeLieu, effective July 1st. I will nominate Robert H. B. Baldwin of New Jersey, currently a partner in the investment firm of Morgan Stanley, and a consultant to the Secretary of the Navy, to take Mr. BeLieu's place.;Q. What does he do?;THE PRESIDENT. He is consultant to the Secretary of the Navy and a partner in private life--he comes from the firm of Morgan Stanley.;CABINET TO REVIEW INTERNATIONAL;SITUATION [12.] I called a meeting of the Cabinet for 11 a.m. Friday. We will have a thorough review and discussion of the international situation, and U.S. policies. I will ask the Secretary of State to review the dozen or more diplomatic proposals and initiatives that we have considered and received and proposed, so that all the members of the Cabinet may evaluate and discuss them and be informed about them in greater detail than has been permitted before.;In addition, we will explore with members of the Cabinet certain other hopes for peace that we are evaluating and considering. The Secretary of Defense will report on the status of the men in uniform, who protect us and who defend us, and the quality of their performance, the dangers that they have undertaken, the commitments that we have made to certain areas of the world. That will be thoroughly and carefully reviewed, and members of the Cabinet will make--those not on the National Security Council--the Secretary of the Treasury is, and the Attorney General comes frequently, and, of course, the Vice President is always there--but others will make any suggestions that they come to, and very likely will make some suggestions to new initiatives which we have already tried, and some unsuccessfully.;I think that is all I have at this time.;QUESTIONS;RESIGNATIONS AND APPOINTMENTS [13.] Q. Mr. President, will Mr. BeLieu have any office in Government?;THE PRESIDENT. He has resigned from his office and he has not informed me what he expects to do.;When Mr. McNamara came over the other day to talk about personnel matters he presented these resignations and made these suggestions, and while studies have been made of the men--investigations that we normally make, we brought them up to date, and since that meeting--whenever it was, 3 or 4 days ago, it was on the record--I have decided to name Mr. Resor and Mr. Baldwin.;CONGRESSIONAL COMMENTS AND THE;NEGOTIATIONS IN VIET-NAM [14.] Q. Mr. President, since you made a recent speech, you expressed a willingness and acceptance of the fact that your foreign policy was very subject to public discussion and such open remarks as this--;THE PRESIDENT. I have always believed that.;Q. Yes, sir, but in the last day or two, this criticism or discussion on Capitol Hill has become a little more pointed--;THE PRESIDENT. In recent days it has become a little more what?;Q. Pointed. Senator Clark of Pennsylvania says we must negotiate with the Viet Cong or we will never get a peace without it. What do you think of a statement like that by a member of the Foreign Relations Committee?;THE PRESIDENT. First, I think Senator Clark is a very able member of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has been interested, I recall, through the years when I was leader--he wanted to go on Foreign Relations and has been added to Foreign Relations recently. I think he has a perfect right to express himself--and a duty. His suggestion is one that I think has been carefully considered by Secretary Rusk and Secretary Ball, 8 and for that matter the entire Security Council and the President.;8 Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Under Secretary of State George W. Ball.;I think that you must observe--as accurate and perceptive as you are a good many times--and I think we all wish we could settle these differences by discussion and by reasoning them out instead of the way we are attempting to settle it.;I have no doubt--I am sure other Senators who are real familiar with this matter, including Senator Clark, have no doubt that if the Viet Cong had a viewpoint to present and were anxious to negotiate they would have no difficulty finding the government to negotiate.;I don't think that you would have a group that feels very strongly--maybe like the group at the Pentagon yesterday, or maybe State--I don't believe we'd ever agree to someone negotiating that is not a government. I am not aware of any government the Viet Cong has. What would you think about the State of Mississippi negotiating for us in this matter? Although it is a State it is not a sovereign government.;Now, if there is any indication, or anyone has information--I remember one time Senator Borah 9 said he had better information than the President. At that time, Smitty, 10 it was a matter of much more point than it is now, and much more equal, I am glad to say. But our information is when we asked them to come into the United Nations last August, after we said you bring these people in and let's try to work through the U.N., they weren't the slightest interested-the North Vietnamese were not.;9 William E. Borah, Senator from Idaho 1907-1940.;10 Merriman Smith of United Press International.;In February, we started the program of trying to curtail their ammunition supply and trying to eliminate their bridges and make it more difficult for them to come in, and attempting to convince them we were there to keep our commitment and we were going to keep it although they believed from some things said in word and writing, we might not. We attempted to convince them.;They told our representatives, our spokesmen, people who were negotiating for us (not members of this Government), and this is an example that I have used in talking to a good many people in the Congress and elsewhere, "this inflexibility characterizes the position of this entire regime, and illustrates its great measure of confidence in itself. It considers it holds all the trump cards, that world opinion is becoming more sympathetic, that the United States retaliation is limited, that South Viet-Nam is having its difficulties and they are not the slightest interested.;On February 15th, the same man reported to us and just a few days ago, I believe it was June 7. And the message on June 7 was just about the same as the message on February 15. It is a confidential message but I will unclassify a paragraph or two of it for you.;He is completely persuaded, from his conversations with the officials, they are not now interested in any negotiation of any kind. He said he was able to see he names a high official--and he followed the standard line that the United States offer of unconditional discussion was deceitful. He asked them to elaborate on any proposal they would consider. He remained deliberately vague and gave no clear answer. We pressed him specifically about this matter but only received a vague and very indefinite reply.;He just talks about being impressed by an American in a foreign country, and he concludes the paragraph that his impressions from all of his meetings and discussions was there has been no change whatever in their position or at least they did not seem about to let such change be known.;Now, if any of these people want to negotiate they would have no difficulty finding a way. I told them in Baltimore we would like to go and would hope to do, and have repeated it since, and we have indicated many, many times we would be glad to negotiate with any government. Now they are going into groups of people.;Well, that is the current line. You remember first we had no policy. Second, we wouldn't explain it. Third, we ought to negotiate. Fourth, we ought to have a halt. These things originate and in about a month they come to us. You will find a good deal of it in the next few weeks--negotiate directly with the Viet Cong. And I would say the Viet Cong would have no difficulty, since they are controlled, directed, and masterminded from North Viet-Nam, in getting any view to us they wanted.;Q. Mr. President, this man who is reporting in, is this an American national?;THE PRESIDENT. You don't need to give him a blood test.;Q. This man was talking to Hanoi?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. The negotiations, or who is carrying it on and how, I don't see how that could be of any value. The substance is what you want, not how much he weighs, how tall he is, or what country he represents. What we are trying to do is get them to talk to us.;Q. Mr. President, the Commonwealth meeting in London agreed to contact countries principally involved. Would you care to comment on that, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I think the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the Prime Ministers of other Commonwealth countries are deeply interested in this matter and we are happy they are. We have reviewed their ideas and we are keeping close touch with them. We are very happy they have made this suggestion. We have talked to them, communicated with them about it, and they will have our full cooperation and we are delighted.;As I indicated the day after I took over as President, I'd be glad to go anywhere, do anything, see anybody, anytime that offered any hope of peace, and this is hope. We hope they can select a good committee that will be fair to all sides and we will be glad to meet with them, and we hope that every other country involved will be glad to meet.;We welcome any attempt, as we told them about the Cambodian conference 11 and we replied to the 17 nations, 12 as we said in 44 States and as we tried to repeat in some length in Pat Furgurson's 13 town of Baltimore some time ago.;11 On April 25, 1965, Secretary of State Dean Rusk stated that the U.S. would gladly participate in any conference on Cambodia. The text of his remarks is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 52, p. 711).;12 On March 15, 1965, at Belgrade, Yugoslavia, a conference of 17 nonaligned nations adopted a declaration on the war in Viet-Nam. The 17-nation declaration and the U.S. reply are printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 52, p. 610).;13 Ernest B. (Pat) Furgurson of the Baltimore Sun.;THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED NATIONS [15.] Q. Mr. President, what is to be done about the bad financial condition of the U.N.?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, that is a matter that deeply concerns us. We don't want to see the U.N. wrecked on account of a dollar. At the same time, we recognize the responsibilities of the member nations and there are differences of opinion there and we are trying to carefully consider the merits of the positions of various governments and find an area of agreement.;I am sorry to say we are not in a position to go any further at this time but we are very concerned about it, very anxious to find an answer to it, and we have great hopes for the U.N. and we think it would be tragic if because of a relatively minor amount of money, compared to the total budgets of the various nations, the U.N. should become less effective because of that.;I plan to--I want to put it this way, I hope that I may be able to go to San Francisco next Friday, and I wouldn't take that as a commitment that I am going to be there, but I hope to go and if I do, I may have something to say about the future of the U.N. at that time.;THE SITUATION IN VIET-NAM AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [16.] Q. Mr. President, with the situation in Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic, what is your personal assessment of the chances of improving international relations right now?;THE PRESIDENT. What is the first part of your question?;Q. With the situation in Viet-Nam and the Dominican Republic, what is your assessment?;THE PRESIDENT. I would say it is very difficult. They are strained. We are going to do everything we can to avoid provoking any controversies or straining any relations, and there has been no statement of ours toward any of the leaders of other governments, no propaganda of ours toward other peoples, and in our judgment, no act of ours that would justify irritating anyone who really loved peace and hated war.;We recognize that other nations keep their commitments and are true to their alliances and we assume that they would allow us the same privilege they reserve for themselves. We agreed to help the signatories of the Southeast Treaty Organization and the protocol states, and pursuant to that commitment we are trying to help them save their freedom from aggression. And we intend to save it.;In the Dominican Republic, forces moved in and overthrew the government. And while I am not passing on the merits of the actions that take place many times in many places, where they change governments-and we believe in change of conditions, and we are trying to obtain them through the Alliance for Progress--but in this particular instance, a fact that has been emphasized all too little, I think, some 1,500 innocent people were murdered and shot, and their heads cut off, and six Latin American embassies were violated and fired upon over a period of 4 days before we went in.;As we talked to our Ambassador to confirm the horror and tragedy and the unbelievable fact that they were firing on Americans and the American Embassy, he was talking to us from under a desk while bullets were going through his windows and he had a thousand American men, women, and children assembled in the hotel who were pleading with their President for help to preserve their lives.;We didn't start that. We didn't intervene. We didn't kill anyone. We didn't violate any embassies. We were not the perpetrators. But after we saw what had happened we took the necessary precautions as I have said so often and as I repeat again: We do not want to bury anyone and we don't intend to, but we are not going to be buried ourselves. And as we had to go into the Congo to preserve the lives of American citizens and haul them out when they were being shot at, we went into the Dominican Republic to preserve the lives of American citizens and citizens of a good many other nations--46 to be exact, 46 nationals.;While some of the nations were denouncing us for going in there their people were begging us to protect them. And the American Marines protected them. Twenty died. We removed 5,600 people from 46 nations and we didn't sprain an ankle doing it. But we had 20 of our boys killed by the rebels who fired first and who tried to keep us from evacuating these people. We established a peace zone.;We had only two purposes there. One, to get an Inter-American Force in there to bring about a cease-fire and preserve peace, that is all. We are not after their money or after their philosophy or trying to dominate them. We said that. And we tried our best to get them there as quick as we could and we finally got them--and General Alvim is doing an excellent job under great difficulties.;Yesterday I saw one of his cables, and it was 23 minutes after they started shooting before he replied. I don't know how many of you are anxious to stand up and be shot at by tommy-guns, and you ask a lot of these boys to do that. That is the first thing.;The second was to have a government broadly based to be acceptable to the people of the Dominican Republic. We are not pointing, we are not matching a computer and saying, here is what the government will be. We asked Mr. Bundy, Mr. Vance, Mr. Mann, Mr. Vaughn 14 and everyone we knew to talk to the extreme elements--some to talk to the other side, some to the loyalists, the rebels--hoping we could have a cease-fire until we could have a broadly based government, and until the OAS could give help, counsel, and mediation.;14 McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President, Cyrus R. Vance, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Thomas C. Mann, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, and Jack H. Vaughn, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs and United States Coordinator, Alliance for Progress.;They have appointed a very fine committee. They appointed the best men they could find and they are there talking to every group, going all over the land. They are making progress, and we hope that the OAS will have a recommendation on the political matter like they did on the military matter. We don't want it to be unilateral. We much prefer that the forces of all nations go in to save people of 46 nations. But it is taking us 7 weeks to get the two things we have done up to now and haven't got the final answer yet.;We first had a committee appointed, then a man, then another committee appointed from the OAS, and we are proud of what the OAS is doing but it is not a matter that can save lives. As a matter of fact, we landed our people in less than 1 hour from the time the decision was made. It was a decision we considered from Saturday until Wednesday evening. But once we made it, in the neighborhood of 6 or 6:30 that evening, they landed within 1 hour. But they didn't save 1,500 lives.;CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION OF SUPPORT [17.] Q. Mr. President, because of the growing commitment of American combat troops in Viet-Nam, there have been some discussions in Congress that you should go back to Congress for another resolution of support?;THE PRESIDENT. The evidence there is very dear for anybody that has read the resolution. 15;15 The joint resolution (HJ. Res. 1145) to promote the maintenance of international peace and security in southeast Asia was approved on August 10, 1964 (Public Law 88-408, 78 Stat. 384).;First, the authority of the President is very clear and unquestioned without a resolution. The Commander in Chief has all the authority that I am exercising. But because of my desire to have the support of the Congress and to have them a part of any decision we make after consulting their leadership, exchanging viewpoints, and carefully drawing a resolution, we submitted to the Congress language that we thought would make it clear for all time, to one and all.;That language, just as a reminder to you, said the Congress approves and supports the determination of the President as Commander in Chief "to take all--all--all necessary measures to repel any--any--any armed attack against the forces of the United States" and, "to prevent further aggression.;Furthermore, the United States is prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed forces to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in the defense of freedom.;Now, the resolution--and we carefully put this in, and this, I think, will give a full response to your question--this resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international conditions created by the action of the U.N. or otherwise, it may be terminated earlier by concurrent resolution of the Congress. I couldn't veto that resolution. We purposely put it in.;Anytime they want to take the authority the resolution gives me, they can take it away. It is just an expression and they just approved the position that we were taking. So we think that if there is anyone--and there will be some in a body of a hundred when from time to time we ask them to make appropriations, and there are such things as the military bills reported out today, and military assistance which has a lot of testimony in this connection and the economic bill just last week.;Anyone that wants to cannot only speak against us but can vote against us. We don't encourage it, and we think we are very fortunate that we are as unified as we are. The first vote was 502-2 and my study of history would indicate that that is rather unusual even for most extreme times.;I remember Jeannette Rankin of Montana 16 voting against a declaration of war. And on the last vote, I believe it was 10 out of 35. So we are very happy at the support we are receiving and the people are supporting us not only in this country but other places.;16 Jeannette Rankin, Representative from Montana 1917-1919 and 1941-1943.;I told Senator Long 17 yesterday morning: Do not be dissuaded and do not become discouraged because I remember your father telling about the Louisiana farmer that stayed awake night after night because of the frogs barking in the pond. Finally he got irritated and angry and the way you all describe me--those of you that never come around here--and he went out and drained the pond and killed both frogs.;17 Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana.;We aren't going to kill anybody but we recognize the frogs and the ponds and they keep us awake sometimes. That is the freedom we love.;President Eisenhower told me about a prominent Soviet general who came into his office during the war and criticized one of the newspaper reporters. He was talking about some bad articles that had been written about him, and he thought they were unjust. And President Eisenhower told him he would consider it. The next day the Soviet general came back to the headquarters and said he wanted Merriman Smith, or whoever it was, court-martialed.;President Eisenhower said, "Here is a big book compiled on what they said about me." He said, "Before I left here I went home to see my mother and there were five Eisenhower boys there, and Milton is a liberal, progressive head of a university, one is a banker, the other is a constitutional lawyer, one is a professor, and one is an engineer." He said, "My father was a railroad man who married my mother when she was 19 years old and gave birth to five children. She had five boys--there had been six but there were five there that day, I believe it was, but two of those boys are ultra-conservatives and two of those boys are progressive liberals and one of them is General of the Army. I am over here fighting for that fight and to preserve that right where a railroad man can marry a 19-year-old girl and produce five children and two of them can develop into conservatives and two liberals and one General of the Army.;So, I have been around Congress too long--35 years--not to understand that there are going to be different viewpoints but I applaud and appreciate the assistance that General Eisenhower, who is the only President of the other party that is living, has given me.;I read last night a very lengthy report of a briefing that he had received and his reactions and I have asked him to come back to the White House from time to time, and don't you think there is an emergency when he walks in. He is going to be here the latter part of this month, speaking to Howard. 18 I am going to talk to him then.;18 Son June 17, 1965, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed an audience at Howard University in Washington, D.C., at a ceremony honoring 320 college students who were to spend the summer in Europe as "people-to-people" ambassadors.;I consult with President Truman from time to time, but the strength the opposition party has given me is very much appreciated and the support of my own people. I don't know of any similar period in history with the great difficulties we are facing now that the Congress has performed more magnificently.;I may question some individual member some time close to election, but I am not going to quarrel with any this early.;FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, JR. [18.] Q. Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt 19 said he would like to talk to you as to whether he should run for mayor or not. Are you going to see him?;THE PRESIDENT. I have not seen him. I have not talked to him. I will be happy to talk to him. I like him. He performed a very valuable service to this administration but I am not in the business of selecting mayors for any cities. I would, of course, be happy to talk to any prominent citizen, and I include Mr. Roosevelt in that group, who desire to talk to me about his future or any others. As a matter of fact, I talked to Franklin Roosevelt, St., about my future a good many times and I would feel very bad if I refused.;19 Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr., Chairman, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.;THE SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT [19.] Q. Mr. President, is there anything you can tell us on the supersonic transport?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. The Russians have made considerable advances in that field. We watched them with interest and we are glad they have been successful.;The French and the British have made rapid strides in that field and as you know it won't be long before they have their plane ready. We have carefully studied it and tested the sonic boom and other things necessary. I told the committee of the Vice President, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Webb, Mr. McNamara, Mr. Halaby, 20 and others--we are going to build it if the Congress gives us some money. We want the best plane and we want one the airlines will buy, so, therefore, it must be a sizeable undertaking involving hundreds of millions-over a billion dollars for the first plane--and it has got to be at a price they will buy and can use to haul people 2,000 miles an hour, or however fast it goes--2,200 some of them. The Russian, I think, is 1,600.;20 James E. Webb, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense, and N. E. Halaby, Administrator, Federal Aviation Agency.;To do that we have got to get the best brains in this country who know how to build a plane, and that is not a civil service worker or ex-governor or even manager of an airport.;So, Mr. McNamara and the Secretary of the Treasury--because of the balance of payments we want these people to buy our planes instead of buying abroad--Mr. McCone 21 worked with us because of his experience in business before he left, Mr. Webb because of the NASA interest. And we looked to try to get the best man in the United States without regard to politics, without regard to anything, and we think we got the best man in the United States. His name is "Bozo" McKee.;21 John A. McCone, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.;He was the head of Wright Field, he was a procurement expert, and Mr. McNamara said he has been on a good many different sides with him and against him, but he considered him the best man. Mr. Webb grabbed him up for the space program--he is 50 and some odd years and he has an $8,000 retirement--and so he got him and sent him to some of his NASA centers to give expert advice on procurement and building and construction, because that is his business. He built a lot of airplanes. He was in charge of Wright Field.;I called him one morning at 7:30--they agreed he was best--and I said, "What are you doing?" And he said he didn't have his britches on. And I said, "Get them on and come on up." I asked him to take this job and he said he didn't like the idea of being tied down and looked forward to a vacation. I said he could have it after he gave us air supremacy, and if he could do it after 2 or 3 years he could go back to Palm Springs or Nassau. And like most men trained by West Point and Annapolis, or whatever, he said, "If that is what the Commander in Chief wants me to do I will do it." ("I have been separated from my wife in three wars..."--that was Maxwell Taylor 22 who was separated from his wife.) I asked Mr. McKee to do the job. But they had gotten into an argument with General Quesada 23 and they had put a provision in the act that the head must be a civilian. The head or deputy is a general but he is not going to build a transport. We want the man to head it and be responsible for it, and we asked the Congress--as you do in extreme cases--to permit this man to move over from NASA, where he didn't have to be confirmed, to FAA at the same salary.;22 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, U.S. Ambassador to South Viet-Nam.;23 E. R. Quesada, former Administrator, Federal Aviation Agency.;He kept his $8,000 retirement and got the job, whatever it pays--28 or 30. So, we sent the bill up there and Congressman Harris had been against the General because of the problem with General Quesada. But he thought it was merited, and I called him down in Arkansas and he said we ought to get the best man.;But he is the most experienced and he is the best now. The bill has passed the House overwhelmingly. Only one Democrat voted against it. It is in the Senate. It is up today and I hope, as I speak, the roll is called on it and I hope McKee will take that job. 24 And I told him we want him to go full steam ahead, around the clock, until we obtain the best plane at the best price that was achievable.;24 A bill (H.R. 7777) authorizing the President to appoint Gen. William F. McKee to the office of Administrator, Federal Aviation Agency was approved on June 22, 1965 (Public Law 89-46, 79 Stat. 171).;THE DENVER FLOOD DISASTER [20.] Q. Mr. President, have you been apprised of the Denver flood disaster and have you taken any action?;THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Ellington 25 has that matter before him. It is a matter for the Governor. The Governor called me. I haven't been able to talk to him. Governor Ellington will talk to him and we will make all resources available to him.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.;25 Buford Ellington, Director, Office of Emergency Planning, and former Governor of Tennessee.;FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE PRESIDENT;THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF [21.] I have a couple of additional announcements to make. Doug Cater 26 has been working with Health, Education, and Welfare on the education bill and health bill, and he's been doing so well that I want to get him back where his time is not so divided. I hope that he can get back with the work of the Security Council, and I am going to ask him to. And as soon as I can I am going to move him over from the Executive Office Building. And I will probably move Horace Bushy, 27 too. Both of them will be devotees of Mr. Bundy.;Are the wire services here?;26 S. Douglass Cater, Jr., Special Assistant to the President.;27 Horace Busby, Jr., Special Assistant to the President.;Q. We'll tell them, Mr. President.;THE PRESIDENT. This is that pool that you're always seeking there. Busby will undertake a variety of duties. As you know, he now prepares statements for me, and does research, and analyzes, and gives me advice on a good many matters. But he will concentrate some on space, on defense, on various regions of the world, and various messages and correspondence that we will be sending to other countries. We have an exchange of things that go back and forth, and I'll have him attend to and specialize in that field, and there will be others, including this but not limited to this.;Mr. Cater will be working in foreign policy, generally. He'll be doing what he can to give us advice on cooperative efforts that we can make in matters like saline water, or against the ancient enemies of mankind, or in food, health, education, with other nations. That is a big problem. If we can get those people some food and clothing and housing and some education and health, we would not be having all this bombing. It would not be necessary to make them.;They'll be working with USIA, keeping in close touch with them. Both of them will be working with certain international organizations: SEATO, CENTO, NATO, U.N.;They'll have increasingly important roles in the preparation of all of my statements and my press conferences. For that reason, they'll be kept informed of all major national security matters, and they'll be present on all security matters. They may not go to lunch with me on Tuesday. But they don't mind. I'd be glad to have them there, but they'll be in on official meetings and on a good many of the unofficial ones. They have both worked very closely with me for a good many years on a series of subjects, and they have been very helpful to me in Viet-Nam, and the Dominican Republic, and in other areas.;Now, Mr. Bundy will continue to head the staff. He has several people specializing in various areas, Bob Komer, Cooper, 28 and different ones, and they'll still have their regions. But these men will be working within the fields I've told you about.;28 Robert W. Komer, Deputy Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and Chester L. Cooper, senior member of the National Security Council staff.;JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS [22.] I anticipate that I will name very shortly Judge Homer Thornberry to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the 5th District of Texas, and former Governor I. P. Coleman of Mississippi 29 Mr. Coleman is a former attorney general of that State, a former judge of that State, and a former Governor of that State. Thornberry is a former district attorney, a former member of the city council, a former member of the legislature, a former Member of the Congress. He's now a district judge and he'll be promoted to the circuit court.;29 Also appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.;Q. What was Governor Coleman to be?;Q. How about replacements?;THE PRESIDENT. That's a matter we'll have to look into. I want to get the recommendation from the Bar Association. I want to consult with Senator Yarborough.;Under the Constitution, the President appoints judges and the Senate confirms judges. It doesn't mean necessarily that when a bar association checks them because of a practice they're in that we give the Bar Association the appointment power of the President. It doesn't mean that we give the Senate the appointment power. If they're not qualified they can always reject them. The Bar Association does a good many times in their judgment, and the President goes ahead and acts anyway. I don't have the record but a good many have been rejected.;A good many times men not qualified may be personally obnoxious, but I would try to select one that is qualified to meet the Bar Association's requirements, one that is not obnoxious. And I prefer someone who is actually supported by Senator Yarborough and is not offensive to any Member of the Senate and has the qualifications of the job beyond the peradventure of a doubt. I have not gone in and considered anyone.;Judge Adrian Spears will move to Austin and will reside in Austin and will succeed Congressman Thornberry there.;Q. Mr. President, of course--;THE PRESIDENT. This is not another press conference.;Q. Mr. Busby and Mr. Cater, of course, will retain their present titles?;THE. PRESIDENT. Yes, their same present titles. This is just an expansion of their duties.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">July 9, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE. PRESIDENT. After you have had a chance to write your stories, we will be going to Texas and will be there over the weekend. I thought you might have some questions you wanted to ask me, and if you do, I have a few minutes to answer them.;REPORT ON VIET-NAM [1.] Q. Mr. President, in the light of recent news developments concerning Viet-Nam, I wonder, sir, if you could give us an up-to-date assessment of how the war is going out there, what is happening, and what sort of news you think the country can expect in the next month or two?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we will have a somewhat better picture of that after Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge 1 return a week from next Wednesday. I spent an hour or so with the Secretary this morning reviewing the reports that have come in from there, and evaluating them and discussing with him the work that he is going to do with Ambassador Lodge when he is out there.;1 Henry Cabot Lodge, newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to South Viet-Nam, who had previously served in that position from July 1963 to June 1964.;The incidents are going up: that is, the Viet Cong attacks. The casualties are going up. From June 15th through July 3d there were 4,556 Viet Cong dead counted, and some 1,900 South Vietnamese forces, and some 40 Americans. We have lost in the neighborhood of some 300 men in the period since I have been President. We expect that it will get worse before it gets better. They have had substantial increases in the aggression forces. They are swinging wildly. They are suffering substantial losses in their sneak attacks.;Our manpower needs there are increasing, and will continue to do so. We have some 60,000--odd people there now, and they are landing each day. There are some 75,000 that will be there very shortly. There will be others that will be required.;Whatever is required I am sure will be supplied. We have met and taken action to meet the requests made by General Westmoreland, 2 and as other needs appear, we will promptly meet them.;2 Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Commander of United States Forces in South Viet-Nam.;We committed our power and our national honor, and that has been reaffirmed by three Presidents. I have neither a rosy nor a gloomy report to make. It will require understanding and endurance and patriotism.;We have suffered 160,000 casualties since World War II, but we did not allow Greece or Turkey or Iran or Formosa or Lebanon or others to fall to aggressors, and we don't plan to let up until the aggression ceases.;I will ask Secretary McNamara to talk to you before he leaves, or talk to the press before he leaves. I reviewed with him in some detail this morning his plans, and I am sure he will tell you all about them that he can.;MEETINGS WITH FOREIGN POLICY ADVISERS AND WITH TASK FORCE GROUPS [2.] Q. Mr. President, I understand that you met until well after midnight last night with a group of foreign policy advisers. Could you tell us about that meeting?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, that is not a correct statement. I met until about 8 o'clock with them, maybe 8:30. I don't recall exactly. After I left that meeting, I met with a number of members of my task forces and chairmen of the task groups that are studying our program for next year and making our plans that will be submitted in the State of the Union Message, so they probably got those two meetings mixed up.;We discussed the balance of payments situation, and we had a brief report from Secretary Fowler. We discussed the European situation, NATO, and our relations with European countries and had a brief report in that connection from Secretary Ball, 3 who left today for a meeting of the Deputy Prime Ministers in Europe.;3 George W. Ball, Under Secretary of State.;We discussed the Latin American situation, including the Dominican Republic and other sensitive areas, and we had a brief report from Secretary Mann. 4;4 Thomas C. Mann, Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.;We discussed the Asian situation, and the problems in India, and Pakistan, and their economic plans. Reports were received from Mr. George Woods 5 of the International Bank. Secretary Rusk reviewed them in some detail. We discussed our plans and ideas in the field of disarmament and proliferation. Mr. Bundy 6 went into some detail on that. We spent a substantial amount of time on Viet-Nam--I expect more time on that than on all of the other subjects. I will get Bill 7 to supply you with the time we went in and went out.;5 George D. Woods, President, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.;6 McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the President.;7 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President.;I went from that meeting to a meeting with the task force in the mess. I had my dinner with them and stayed until after midnight.;I will give you the subjects that we discussed. (I asked Bill to get them for me, and he did, but I misplaced the list.) I can give you pretty generally the basic ones-resources, education, health, fiscal policy, economic foreign policy, beautification, and the basic things.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [3.] Q. Can you give us an evaluation of the Dominican situation now?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we are having very thorough reports from there. Ambassador Bunker 8 will be back to spend the weekend. We have been conferring with every interested group of citizens from all factions, and the OAS committee feels quite encouraged. There is a minimum of disorder. There is some economic dislocation and some strikes that have given some difficulties, but under all the circumstances we have made remarkable progress.;8 Ellsworth Bunker, United States Representative to the Organization of American States.;The OAS is entitled to our thanks for the diligence of their representatives there, and their effectiveness. I would hope that we will have some specific plans that will be acceptable, and that the OAS will make specific recommendations that will be acceptable to all concerned at an early date.;BALANCE OF PAYMENTS [4.] Q. Are the reports, sir, that the balance of payments deficit is wiped out in the last 3 months true, and if so, what about some worry among economists that this could hurt the economy of Europe, that they will not have the dollars that they had before?;THE PRESIDENT. The reports that I have read are highly inaccurate. They cannot be confirmed. We do not have the exact information. I asked the Secretary of the Treasury to give me even his speculation, and he refused to do that yesterday. After I read the wire service stories, and stories in other periodicals, I asked the Chairman of the Economic Advisers, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the Treasury. All of them were unfamiliar with it. They said that the only thing they could say was that it was premature, it was inaccurate, and was undependable so far as the President is concerned.;Now, in the days ahead they may be exactly on the nose, but they are unwilling to say that in their position today, even to me, or to the task forces.;RESIGNATION OF AMBASSADOR TAYLOR;APPOINTMENT OF HENRY CABOT LODGE [5.] Q. Mr. President, it seems inevitable that Ambassador Taylor's resignation is going to encourage or promote stories which allege that the real reason that he resigned was because of policy and/or strategic differences with the administration on how to conduct the war in Viet-Nam. Would you care to comment on these reports even before they become current?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not think that they were inevitable. I would think any such comment would be irresponsible and inaccurate and untrue. There have been no such facts to justify any conclusion of that kind. The letters reveal that, I think, clearly. 9;9 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor served as U.S. Ambassador to South Viet-Nam from June 1964 to July 1965. His letter of resignation, dated July 7, and the President's reply, dated July 8, were not made public by the White House.;To assume that, you would have to assume that neither the President nor General Taylor would tell the truth. General Taylor, at my request, was drafted to take this job. He told me when I asked him to take it that he would do whatever his Commander in Chief said, but that he hoped I would assure him that at the end of 12 months, 1 year, he would be relieved, that he had been taken from his family three times in 45 years, during three wars, and he looked forward to retiring from Government service.;Very shortly after he had retired he had been called back to serve his country. He had done that in connection with the Bay of Pigs study. When he concluded that, they asked him to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and that now he still looks forward to it, but if we needed him there, he would go for 12 months.;So we assured him that we would relieve him at the end of the 12-month period. That period was due to be about June 1st when he returned to Columbia University for a degree that they were to give him.;As usually happens, before General Taylor planned to come back, we had a serious problem there. We had a change of government about that time. It was necessary for him to delay his return for a few days until he had maintained contact with that situation. So he was delayed in departing.;When he came back, in the light of the developments out there, at his suggestion he returned, feeling that he did not want to leave that situation without going back and having an orderly transition that would not have been necessary if it had the same government. But we had a new government.;On March the 23th I had received from Ambassador Lodge an indication that he would be available for service to the Government. I had asked him to take another assignment. He told me that he would be glad to do it if I felt that that is where he could be best used, but if I had any thought of asking him to go back to Viet-Nam after General Taylor's year was up, that he would be available to do that.;I said, "Well, you think it over and talk to Mrs. Lodge, and call me back the next morning. And let us wrap this one up.;On the morning of March 24th he called me back and said he would be available. Since that time we have had him go to SEATO, and to NATO countries. We have had him appear before the Congress, and at the debate at Oxford. We have kept him in complete touch with the situation. When General Taylor was ready to be relieved, it was agreed that this was the most effective and desirable way for us to do it.;Does that answer your question?;[6.] Q. Mr. President, in connection with Mr. Lodge's appointment, as you know, there has been a good deal of criticism about his appointment, especially because of his role during the overthrow of President Diem. 10 I would like to ask whether you anticipated those criticisms and how deeply concerned you are about them?;THE PRESIDENT. I know that some people can find fault with almost anything you do. I always anticipate that there will be some difference of opinion. I believe that in the Government there is none. The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Assistant to the President in charge of matters of this kind, Mr. Bundy, and the President, all felt that Mr. Lodge had a grasp of the situation, a knowledge of the situation, that no other American had, that he was the best equipped, the best qualified, and the most experienced to do this work.;10 Ngo Dinh Diem, former President of South Viet-Nam, who was executed after his government was overthrown by a military coup on November 2 1963.;He had a combination of military experience, actual service in World War II, and diplomatic experience. He had gone to the SEATO nations and the NATO nations. He had been Ambassador there for some time and his service was highly respected by the governments of that area that he worked with, and by the people in this Government that he worked with.;It was with great regret that we accepted his resignation when he decided he should come home prior to the Republican Convention. It was with great pleasure that we learned he would respond to the President's request to go back.;I think that we have the best man that is available to the United States in one of the most difficult jobs. I think the representatives of the people and the people will think so, too. He asked for 2 days' notice to notify his employers and to discuss the matter with General Eisenhower. I had discussed it with him some time before. I discussed Mr. Lodge with him and his Government service at a meeting 2 or 3 weeks ago and we gave him that 2 days' notice. That is why we made the announcement yesterday.;THE COMMON MARKET [7.] Q. Mr. President, do you have any comment on the Common Market situation? Did you discuss that yesterday with Mr. Heller? 11 Did you reach any conclusions?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Mr. Heller made a brief report on his meetings that involved the Common Market situation. It involved the monetary situation, it involved the views that the Europeans have about our country, our leadership, and the soundness of the dollar, and so forth. It was an encouraging report generally, although there were some disappointments in it. I asked him to review the matters that he thought he could review with you.;11 Walter W. Heller, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.;TASK FORCE PERSONNEL [8.] The task forces I talked to were the intergovernmental fiscal cooperation, transportation, metropolitan and urban problems, income maintenance task force, cost reduction task force, sustaining prosperity task force, foreign economic policy task force, natural resources task force, preservation of natural beauty, Government reorganization, and education.;I will ask the Press Office to get you those.;Q. Mr. President, are these the same personnel as those who worked on the task force reports?;THE PRESIDENT. There are some adjustments. We have some substitutes, some additions. We think we have the best people available in these respective fields in the country. We have some new Government personnel working with them. For instance, Mr. Schultze 12 of the Budget is new, Mr. McPherson 13 is new. There will be other new ones that I hope to announce over the weekend.;12 Charles L. Schultze, Director, Bureau of the Budget.;13 Harry C. McPherson, Jr., Special Assistant to the President.;I am going to have a rather busy weekend on appointments. I will try to make available to Bill information on them, and I will try to have a televised press conference, for those of you who are interested in that type of information, sometime next week.;CALL UP OF RESERVES [9.] Q. Mr. President, in the light of the increased troop commitment to Viet-Nam, is it conceivable that you might call up some specific reserve units and also, perhaps, extend the draft to cover the other services?;THE PRESIDENT. When we have any plans or announcements to make of that nature, I will get in touch with you.;MISSION TO HANOI [10.] Q. Mr. President, would you say, sir, to what extent you are being kept informed of the mission of Mr. Harold Davies that Prime Minister Wilson is sending to Hanoi, 14 and what opportunity there may be for a peace talk?;THE PRESIDENT. We are informed about it.;14 In early July Prime Minister Harold Wilson of the United Kingdom sent Harold Davies, parliamentary secretary at the Ministry of Pensions, to Hanoi in an attempt to persuade President Ho Chi Minh to meet with a Commonwealth peace mission. The discussions in Hanoi were not successful.;INCOME TAX CUT [11.] Q. Mr. President, in the light of the previous performance of the Government's receipts, have you moved any further along in your thinking about a possible further income tax cut next year?;THE PRESIDENT. We have a task force working on it, and the Secretary and the tax experts are working on it. I spent some time discussing fiscal matters with the Secretary of the Treasury yesterday.;We have a rather thorough report that I am sending to the Cabinet this week that will be released, 15 I think, about the middle of the week by Secretary McNamara that shows $4.6 billion were actually realized during fiscal 1965 in savings, and that was $2.1 billion more than we estimated we could realize.;15 See Item 360.;Savings of $6.1 billion a year by fiscal 1969 and each year thereafter has been set as our new long-range goal. We have the chart, the details of how it is done, the explanations and the challenges of change. We will make those available to the Cabinet and to some 30,000 other individuals that are involved. Secretary McNamara will discuss them in some detail with you a little later.;We cannot foresee at this moment the exact effect of defense expenditures at this time, but we have task forces in each department working on abolishing old programs and cutting down on present expenditures so that we may have some funds available for the subjects I discussed.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">July 13, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.;VIET-NAM [1.] Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge 1 will be leaving tomorrow evening for Saigon. When they return next week, we will give careful consideration to their recommendations, as well as those of Ambassador Taylor 2 and General Westmoreland. 3 And we will do what is necessary.;1 Henry Cabot Lodge, U.S. Ambassador to South Viet-Nam.;2 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, former U.S. Ambassador to South Viet-Nam, who resigned on July 7, 1965.;3 Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Commander of United States Forces in South Viet-Nam.;The present center of the struggle is in South Viet-Nam, but its root cause is a determined effort of conquest that is directed from Hanoi. Heavy infiltration of North Vietnamese forces has created new dangers and difficulties in South Viet-Nam. Increased aggression from the North may require an increased American response on the ground in South Viet-Nam. Increased aggression from the North continues to require very careful replies against selected military targets in North Viet-Nam.;Meanwhile, General Westmoreland has the authority to use the American forces that are now in Viet-Nam in the ways which he considers most effective to resist the Communist aggression and the terror that is taking.place there. These forces will defend their own bases. They will assist in providing security in neighboring areas, and they will be available for more active combat missions when the Vietnamese Government and General Westmoreland agree that such active missions are needed.;So it is quite possible that new and serious decisions will be necessary in the near future. Any substantial increase in the present level of our efforts to turn back the aggressors in South Viet-Nam will require steps to insure that our reserves of men and equipment of the United States remain entirely adequate for any and all emergencies.;Secretary McNamara and Ambassador Lodge will concern themselves also with the political and economic situation. We have had Mr. Eugene Black visiting southeast Asia and he has given me an oral report on his encouraging visit to that area. 4 We mean to make it plain that our military effort is only a necessary preliminary to the larger purpose of peace and progress.;4 On July 10, 1965, the White House announced that Eugene R. Black, adviser to the President on southeast Asian social and economic development, had telephoned the President and given him an encouraging report on his visit to the Far East. During his trip Mr. Black had participated in meetings of the Consultative Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East on the establishment of an Asian Development Bank. He reported to the President that all had gone well, and the Bank would begin operating early in 1966.;DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [2.] In the Dominican Republic, Ambassador Bunker 5 and his colleagues are continuing their skillful and determined effort to find a peaceful solution. We believe, as they do, that it is urgent that a solution bc found, and found promptly.;5 Ellsworth Bunker, U.S. Representative to the Organization of American States.;We are encouraged by indications that leaders on both sides are prepared to stand aside in favor of a new government which will enjoy the confidence of the Dominican people as a whole. Those on both sides who show good will and those who join a new government in the work of restoring peace will deserve the thanks of all of their countrymen. Right now, here, we are both cautious and hopeful.;NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL AS SOLICITOR GENERAL [3.] I am very pleased to announce today that I am nominating Judge Thurgood Marshall to be Solicitor General of the United States. He will succeed the Honorable Archibald Cox, who is retiring after more than 4 years of distinguished service to return to Massachusetts.;The Solicitor General directs all Government litigation before the Supreme Court of the United States and the other appellate courts. Judge Marshall brings to that significant job an outstanding record of legal and judicial experience. He has served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit since 1962, and at very considerable financial sacrifice is resigning in order to meet the needs of his Government.;For a quarter of a century before his appointment to the bench, Judge Marshall was the leading legal champion of equal rights under the law, appearing before the Supreme Court more than 30 times. His vast experience in the Federal courts, and especially in the Supreme Court, has gained Judge Marshall a reputation as one of the most distinguished advocates in the Nation. I know him to be a lawyer and a judge of very high ability, a patriot of deep convictions, and a gentleman of undisputed integrity.;So it is an honor to appoint him as the 33d Solicitor General of the United States. He is here this afternoon and I would like to ask him to stand.;Judge Marshall.;OTHER NOMINATIONS [4.] I intend to nominate Mr. Leonard Marks of Washington, D.C., to be the Director of the United States Information Service, succeeding the Honorable Carl Rowan.;Mr. Marks has an excellent record as a teacher, as a lawyer, and as a Government servant. President Kennedy appointed him to be an original member of the board of directors of the Communications Satellite Corporation in 1962. Since that time he has been reappointed. Mr. Marks, who has had a long interest in international communications, has represented the United States at broadcasting conferences and activities in Italy, India, Pakistan, Switzerland, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iran.;Phillips Talbot, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, will be nominated as United States Ambassador to Greece. He will succeed Mr. Henry R. Labouisse, who is Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund.;A most experienced Foreign Service Officer, the Honorable Raymond A. Hare, who is presently Ambassador to Turkey, will succeed him in his post as Assistant Secretary of State. Ambassador Hare has been in the Foreign Service since 1927. He has served in France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, the United Arab Republic, and Yemen.;I have asked Mrs. Penelope Hartland Thunberg of Maryland to become a member of the United States Tariff Commission. She will serve in the position last held by Commissioner Walter Schreiber for a term expiring June 16, 1970.;Mrs. Thunberg is an international economist presently serving as Deputy Chief of the International Division, Economic and Research Area, Central Intelligence Agency. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Pembroke College and holds the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College. She is here this afternoon and I would like for you to meet her. Please stand up.;RECONVENING OF THE DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE [5.] Yesterday the Soviet Government notified the United States Government that it is agreeable to the resumption of negotiations of the 18-nation Disarmament Committee at Geneva. The United States has suggested a date no later than July 27th for this resumption. Mr. William C. Foster now is in the process of inquiring whether this date is agreeable to the other 16 members of the Disarmament Committee.;At the conclusion of the Geneva conference last September, it was agreed that the two cochairmen, the Soviet Union and the United States, would consult and would agree on a date for resumption, after which the other members of the Committee would be consulted in order to obtain their agreement as well.;Mr. Foster met with the Soviet spokesman in New York on June 15th on instructions to urge reconvening of the Disarmament Committee as soon as possible. Yesterday's Soviet response is an encouraging development. As we have stated before, peace is the leading item on the agenda of mankind, and every effort should be made to lead us toward that goal. As I stated in San Francisco, we will come to these next negotiations with proposals for effective attack on these deadly dangers to mankind, and we hope that others will do the same.;Now I am prepared to take your questions.;QUESTIONS;MANPOWER NEEDS FOR VIET-NA VIET-NAM [6.] Q. Mr. President, in your statement about the situation in Viet-Nam, sir, you referred to the necessity for maintaining adequate reserves and adequate equipment. I wonder, sir, in view of the increased fighting and the increasing manpower commitment, are you giving any thought, is the Government giving any thought, first, to calling up additional Reserves, or second, to increasing draft calls?;THE PRESIDENT. The Government is always considering every possibility and every eventuality. No decisions have been made in connection with the Reserve or increasing draft calls. We will be in a better position to act upon matters of that kind after the Secretary returns from his trip.;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN'S TRIP TO MOSCOW [7.] Q. Mr. President, could you tell us whether Governor Harriman's 6 trip to Moscow has any connection with the Soviet position in Viet-Nam?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that the Governor has best explained that trip himself by saying it is a vacation. That is on the wires today. It is not an official Government trip. He was not sent there by the President, although the Governor is a man of a wide range of interests and experience. I approved heartily of his statement that he would be glad to visit with any people that cared to visit with him. It is a personal trip, and a vacation trip in nature.;6 W. Averell Harriman, Ambassador at Large and former Governor of New York.;POSSIBILITY OF AVOIDING MAJOR WAR IN ASIA [8.] Q. Mr. President, what do you think, in your judgment, are the chances at this time of avoiding a major land war in Asia?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think that anyone can prophesy what will happen from day to day, or week to week, or month to month. I think it is well for us to remember that three Presidents have made the pledge for this Nation, that the Senate has ratified the SEATO treaty by a vote of 82 to I, pledging the United States to come to the aid of any nation, upon their request, who are parties to that treaty or protocol.;President Eisenhower made our first commitment there in 1954. That was reaffirmed by President Kennedy many times in different ways. The present President has reiterated the stand of the United States that we expect to keep that commitment.;Our national honor is at stake. Our word is at stake. And it must be obvious to all Americans that they would not want the President of their country to follow any course that was inconsistent with our commitments or with our national honor.;MERGER OF RESERVES AND NATIONAL GUARD [9.] Q. Mr. President, sir, in view of the situation in North Viet-Nam and South Viet-Nam, are you thinking of continuing the plans for a merger of Reserves and the National Guard?;THE PRESIDENT. So far as I am aware, the situation there has no effect on the merger one way or the other.;Q. Would it not affect the efficiency of our forces?;THE PRESIDENT. It is contended that the merger would improve the efficiency, but I do not think that it is a matter that would be considered in connection with what happens out there, one way or the other.;MANNED ORBITING LABORATORY [10.] Q. Mr. President, could you give us a status report on the Air Force's manned orbiting laboratory, and specifically whether you intend to give it a "go-ahead," and if so, when?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I am not in a position to make a statement on that at this time. The Space Council has had some briefings in connection with the matter. There is a study going on every day in that connection, but I would not want to go further than that now.;RELATIONS WITH SOVIET UNION [11.] Q. Mr. President, in view of the Disarmament Conference and the Soviet response, and Ambassador Harriman's conversations with the Soviet Union, could you give us your assessment of the Soviet-American relations as they stand now? Could you give us a temperature reading?;THE PRESIDENT. We are very anxious to maintain close relations with the Soviet Union, and we had felt that considerable progress had been made in the last several years. Unfortunately, the situation that developed in North Viet-Nam has placed a strain on those relations. We regret it very deeply, but we have felt that, as I said earlier, our national honor required us to pursue the course of conduct that we have followed.;We will be looking for every opportunity that we can to work with the Soviet Union in the interest of peace. We think that the resumption of the Disarmament Conference is one step in that direction. We would like to improve the relations any way we can.;MANPOWER NEEDS FOR VIET-NAM [12.] Q. Mr. President, you told us last week, sir, that things in Viet-Nam will probably get worse before they can get better. And today you indicate that we will probably send a lot more forces there than we have now. Can you give us any appraisal as to how many, or are we going to change our fighting, or is a new concept going to be introduced? Can you give us any indication of that?;THE PRESIDENT. As I said in my opening statement, the aggression has increased. The forces that are pursuing that aggression have greatly increased in number. It will be necessary to resist that aggression and, therefore, to have substantially larger increments of troops which we have been supplying from time to time.;I do not think that anyone can tell at this date any special figure that will be required, but I think that following Ambassador Lodge and Secretary McNamara's trip we will have a better estimate of what the rest of the year will hold for us.;GOVERNMENT IN SAIGON [13.] Q. Mr. President, some people have questioned the ability of the South Vietnamese to govern themselves at this point--most recently, Senator Stennis of Mississippi. Can you give us some indication of what you see in the future for the reestablishment of democratic civilian rule in Saigon?;THE PRESIDENT. We would hope that if the North Vietnamese would cease their aggression we could immediately take steps to have the people of South Viet-Nam exercise their choice and establish a government of their choosing. We, of course, would hope that that would be a very efficient and effective and democratic system.;SEARCH FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT [14.] Q. Mr. President, with the increasing number of American troops going to Viet-Nam, would you say if there will be a continuing or any increasing diplomatic probing for a peaceful settlement?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, we will constantly be on the alert to probe, and to be ready and willing to negotiate with the appropriate people. I must say that candor compels me to tell you that there has not been the slightest indication that the other side is interested in negotiation or in unconditional discussions, although the United States has made some dozen separate attempts to bring that about.;RELATIONS WITH THE PRESS [15.] Q. Mr. President, quite a bit has been written recently about your relations with the press. Some of these stories have been openly critical, to say the least, sir. We seem to have heard from everybody but you. I wonder if you could give us your views on the subject?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that the press and the Congress and the people of the United States have, generally speaking, with very minor exceptions, given me during the time I have been President very strong support and very excellent cooperation. I know that there are some in each segment that have been disappointed in some of my decisions and some of my actions. I like to think that those who talk about them the most see us the least, and so far as I am concerned, I have no criticism to make of any other people in helping me do my job.;We have a very fine Cabinet. Nearly every person I have asked to come and help the Government has done so. I think that there are very few Presidents in the history of this country that have had more support of more publishers and more magazines than the present President. I am grateful for that, although I recognize it is an essential 'part of their duty to point up weaknesses that they think exist.;I have seen that take place for some 35 years, and as long as they point them out, in the manner in which they are pointing them out, and the people continue to support us, and the Congress continues to support us, I am not going to find any fault with them. During the period that we have had the most hectic, distressing moments here in Washington, the poll has gone up 6 percent out in the country, so I sometimes think maybe it just may be July in the Nation's Capital.;REPEAL OF THE POLL TAX [16.] Q. Mr. President, are you taking any position at this point on the poll tax repealer in the House version of the voting rights bill?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I have taken a position since making my recommendations to the Congress early in the year, that I would like to see the poll tax repealed. I am against the poll tax. I have tried to get it repealed every time that I have had a chance, when I thought we could do it legally.;I have asked the Attorney General to attempt to work with the conferees of both House and Senate to see if they cannot agree on satisfactory language that will give us the most effective repeal provision that is obtainable and that we think can be supported in the courts. I have no doubt but what a very satisfactory solution will be found. And I think that would be quite desirable. 7;7 The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was approved by the President on August 6, 1965 (see Item 409). The act did not abolish the poll tax as a precondition for voting in State elections, but it authorized the Attorney General to test the constitutionality of the poll tax in the courts.;VACANCIES IN USIA [17.] Q. Mr. President, have you discussed with Leonard Marks as yet the particular man or the type of men that you and he might like to fill the other two key vacancies in the USIA--the Deputy Director and the head of the Voice of America?;THE PRESIDENT. No. The Deputy Director is now being handled by a very able man with experience who will be there for a while yet. I am sure that after Mr. Marks reviews the organizations and talks to the present Deputy Director and the present Director, Mr. Rowan, he will come up with some suggestions and recommendations. I believe that they will be acceptable.;HOUSE ACTION ON VOTING RIGHTS [18.] Q. Mr. President, in view of your long history of seeking to keep civil rights a bipartisan matter, why did you single out the House Republican leadership for criticism in your statement on voting rights last week? 8;THE PRESIDENT. I didn't single out anyone. We had had several days' debate about the relative merits of two proposals. It had been observed that the administration proposal was dripping in venom and was inadequate and went too far, and a good many things had been said about it. Finally, when it was put as a test to the judgment of the House and they made their decision, I commended that decision and said that I believed that they were wise in acting as they had. Because had they adopted the so-called Ford or McCulloch substitute for the committee bill, as advocated by Judge Howard Smith and Governor Tuck and others, I was of the opinion it would have diluted and taken strength from the bill that they had passed. 9;8 See Item 349.;9 Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, minority leader of the House of Representatives, and Representative William M. McCulloch of Ohio, ranking Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee, sponsored a substitute for the administration's voting fights bill. The substitute bill was supported by Representatives Howard W. Smith and William M. Tuck, both of Virginia.;I am very proud of the action of the House. I am very proud of the judgment they exercised in that connection. But people are allowed to comment on the relative merits of legislation either before or after a vote, and I found there have been a good many comments on my proposals. I thought it would be appropriate if I carefully limited myself to an observation that the substitute would have diluted the right of every American to vote.;I think all of us are aware of the fact that in years gone by we could have done much more than we have in that field. I have become very conscious of that as I have traveled over this Nation and talked to our people. I think the House acted wisely, and I have every confidence in the action that will follow the conference report. I ask the cooperation of members of both parties. I do not think the substitute was as effective as the bill that was adopted. And I would not like to see us return to it.;THE PRESIDENT'S VIEWS ON CIVIL RIGHTS;GENERALLY [19.] Q. Mr. President, in connection with civil rights and the colloquy between you and the Republican leaders, they have suggested that over the years you have changed your position on civil rights. I wondered if you could give us your concept of your developing philosophy on civil rights legislation?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I think that all of us realize at this stage of the 20th century there is much that should have been done that has not been done. This bill is not going to solve the problem completely itself. There will be much to be done in the years ahead. I think the problem of the American Negro is one of the two or three most important problems that we must face up to with our legislation again next year.;I am particularly sensitive to the problems of the Negro and the problems of the city and the problems which the shift in population has caused, the problems of education. I have task forces working on those things. And perhaps it is because I realize, after traveling through 44 States and after reading some 20,000 or 30,000 letters a week, digests from them, that it is a very acute problem and one that I want to do my best to solve in the.limited time that I am allowed.;I did not have that responsibility in the years past, and I did not feel it to the extent that I do today. I hope that you may understand that I think it is an acute one and a dangerous one, and one that occupies high priority and one that should challenge every American of whatever party, whatever religion. I am going to try to provide all the leadership that I can, notwithstanding the fact that someone may point to a mistake or 100 mistakes that I made in my past.;THE SOVIET UNION'S AID TO HANOI [20.] Q. Mr. President, the Soviet Union announced yesterday a new aid agreement to North Viet-Nam. I think they said it was over and beyond what they are now supplying. Do you see this as a serious, perhaps dangerous contribution to the increased aggression you spoke of earlier that is being directed from the North?;THE PRESIDENT. Peter, 10 I don't think that we can tell the extent of that agreement and how far it will reach. They gave no figures. They did not explain what materials they were going to supply. We have known for some time now that they are furnishing equipment and they are furnishing supplies and they are making contributions of aid in one form or the other to North Viet-Nam, this is no surprise to us at all.;10 Peter Lisagor of the Chicago Daily News.;I read the very general announcement that they had made. There is nothing that I could detect from it, or that our experts could detect, that would give me any more information than contained in the announcement.;EFFECT OF TEACH-INS ON VIET-NAM [21.] Q. Mr. President, do you think it possible that increased aggression and infiltration by North Viet-Nam springs from a misreading on the other side, a perhaps mistaken belief that the teach-ins and whatever criticism there has been here in the United States of your policy, that this represents the voice of the American people?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't think that the teach-ins and the differences of opinion have increased the strength of the North Vietnamese or the aggression that has taken place. I do think that at times our allies, particularly the South Vietnamese people, and particularly our own soldiers, do get concerned about how strong we are behind them and how united we are in this very serious undertaking.;But I am glad to say that I don't think it has had any serious or damaging effect there. I get several letters a day from soldiers in Viet-Nam, service people, the Navy, Marines, Army, and Air. I hear from their parents. And I have yet to receive a single complaining letter.;On occasions they wish that the folks back home, who are following this with such dedicated interest, understood the position as they feel they understand it. But I don't think it has damaged our effort out there and I don't think it will. I think we will be united in this effort.;There will be some differences of opinion about the wisdom of some courses that the President takes, the Executive takes, but whenever and wherever we can, we will try to explain those to the people involved and at least try to get their understanding.;THE SECRETARY OF STATE [22.] Q. Mr. President, there have been reports published from time to time that you might contemplate a change in the office of the Secretary of State. In the months to come, do you foresee such a change?;THE PRESIDENT. None whatever. And I think you do a great damage and a great disservice to one of the most able and most competent and most dedicated men that I have ever known, Secretary Rusk. He sits to my right in the Cabinet room. He ranks first in the Cabinet and he ranks first with me.;SELECTION AS VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE;IN 1960 [23.] Q. Mr. President, there are two recently published versions as to how President Kennedy selected you as his vice presidential running mate in 1960, Mr. Graham's 11 and Mr. Schlesinger's. 12 Which of these, in your judgment, is closest to the truth, or do you have your own version?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not want to get into a dispute with my friends who have written these memorandums. I don't see anything to be gained by that.;11 The late Philip L. Graham, former President of the Washington Post. His account of the 1960 nomination for Vice President is in the form of a memorandum to himself. It is published in "The Making of the President" by Theodore H. White (New York: Atheneum Publishers, 1960).;12 Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., "A Thousand Days--John F. Kennedy in the White House" (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1965).;The President asked me, on his own motion, to go on the ticket with him, and I gave him my reasons for hesitating. He told me he would speak to Speaker Rayburn and others, and he did. Subsequently, he called me and said, "Here's a statement I am going to read on television, unless you have an objection." I listened to it. After I heard it, I felt that I should do what I did. I don't know just how much these men may know about what actually happened, but they are entitled to their opinions. Of course, I know why I did what I did.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks on the Status of Women in America.</td><td class="c6">July 29, 1965</td><td class="c7">Mrs. Peterson, Mrs. Louchheim, distinguished delegates and friends;Here at the White House I have many opportunities to speak to many distinguished visitors. But it is a very rare and very welcome pleasure to meet with a group which is both so distinguished and so attractive as this. In this house where I live, women have a 3 to 1 ratio in their favor. And I don't mind--at least most of the time. But there are moments when, like most husbands and fathers, I wish there were a commission on the status of men to submit some of my grievances to.;I am glad that you could come here today. You represent the commission on the status of women that is created by the Governors of 44 States. When the Governors themselves are here at 5 o'clock this afternoon, I am going to congratulate them on your work which I have been observing.;You are carrying forward in your States and cities the work begun by the National Commission under that very great, grand, and lovely lady--Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. You are looking at the problems as they exist in your own areas, you are seeking solutions that are appropriate to the people of your own sections. The diversity of your outlook and approach is quite heartening and very helpful.;I could talk to you this morning about statistics--statistics on the status of women in the Federal Government. I am very proud that since becoming President, I have found it possible to, on the basis of merit, appoint 114 women to major positions in this Government, and almost 3,000 other women have received appointments or promotions to the highest grades in our career service.;But statistics are not our first concern. Our first concern must be, and is, people. And in our society, rich and strong and successful as it is, people--people, individual people--face increasingly complex and very severe personal challenges. And I am so glad that you are helping in the search for solutions to some of those challenges, especially those challenges which beset women who are both the breadwinners and the mothers.;While we seek to advance women to their rightful place at the top of the ladder of this society, we must never forget and never neglect those women who stand insecurely and uncertainly on the lower rungs. And I think especially of the mothers who face the uncertainties of the marketplace, the heartbreaking dilemmas of impoverished households, without training, often without motivation, very often without even the barest decencies of life, or even the emouonal support of a husband.;Our society and its success is built around a family unit. And despite all of our advances and all of our gains, we must never neglect the fact that that unit--the family unit--has been attacked and has collapsed among too high a significant number of citizens in this country. This blight has hit a disproportionate number of individuals, particularly in our minority groups--especially the Negro. But it is not confined to one group. It is not confined to one income level. All through our society, in suburbia as well as in the slums, we are challenged to strengthen the family unit and to help our mothers, and especially find meaning for their lives and find answers for their burdening responsibilities.;A President must, in times like these, often weigh decisions that are great and that are grave--and most of the time they are grim. But I am always mindful and I never forget that in our complex and our changing, constantly challenging, society the most urgent human problem facing millions of our citizens is the matter of self, the matter of identity, the matter of purpose in his life. The answers that we help others find to such questions matter greatly to the kind of society that we are going to fashion, and matter greatly to the strength that we will have to meet the great tests of our destiny as a great people.;The American woman has a challenging responsibility to meet in this country, whether she puts her knowledge to use in her home community or in Washington, matters very little. What really does matter is that the collective wisdom of women never be lost and never be left unused as we face the serious tests and the soaring promises before us now.;And there are many sources of strength that a President must call upon and must summon in trying periods, and I am happy to say that in this great land of ours I have never found those strengths wanting, and I have never found them hesitant. But I know of no more inspiring and stimulating and confidence-building and tenacious contributions that have been made to me in the 20 months than those that have come from the women of our land--the grandmothers, the mothers, the wives, the daughters, the sweethearts, yes, even the babies.;I have on my desk a stack of letters that involve distress, depression, death, wounds-most of them relate to Viet-Nam where our men are out there trying to help other people have their freedom just as we obtained ours almost 200 years ago. One lady told me, she said;We just had 7 months together, but, oh, what a beautiful 7 months it was, and I am proud that I picked the kind of a husband that loved his country enough that he would give his life to try to see that other peoples of other lands had the choice that we have in this country.;Another mother wrote me and said that her boy had lost his leg and had a little difficulty getting it replaced, where he could walk without great pain, but that he could endure that if I could only get him reassigned back to Viet-Nam where he could go and carry on with his boys against the problems that they face there.;Another lady wrote me the other day and said she is from a southern State, and she said;I want to tell you how proud I am of our country and our Government, and our Congress, and our President for standing up and facing the enemy and not appeasing and not putting off, and not letting happen to us what happened in World Wars I and II-going on until we almost lose before we decide what has happened." She said: "I have 3 boys and one of them died in Viet-Nam, the other one was wounded yesterday in the Dominican Republic, and the third one enlisted to be a paratrooper, to take his training in Texas. And I want to tell you how proud I am of the leadership that is coming." And that was just too much for me. I picked up the phone and said, "Get me that lady up here. I want to talk to her because she has something I need for the problems that I face.;She came, she saw, and she conquered. When she went away, I felt more equal to my responsibilities and more concerned and more compassionate about all of the people in this country.;I looked yesterday at a number of women that I would hope could serve on the highest Court of our land--where one has never served. I didn't select one because when I do, I want it to be absolutely without question the best person--male or female-available for that post. I have appointed some women to the Federal judiciary, some to high places in the executive department, some to the Atomic Energy Commission.;The one thing I need from you more than anything else, aside from your leadership in your local communities, is to take your eyes and your ears, and your head and your heart, and your heels, and try to develop for me the most outstanding women in this country that could be available to lead the people of this country. There are many places that we need to fill if we only could find the brilliant, the trained, the mind and heart, that is out there that we just haven't been able to put our fingers on, and you can do that for me. If you don't get the kind of response from me, you take it up with Lady Bird, because she and Liz Carpenter mount that doorway all the time and put questionnaires to me nearly every day about what I have done for women lately.;Thank you for coming. God bless you all.</td></tr>

Where there was disease we would bring health. Where there was ignorance we would bring learning. We would feed the hungry and we would shelter the homeless, and we would do all of this as free men making liberty the companion of progress.;The adventure began in a dozen scattered spots. In Columbia the Act of Bogota was signed. In Caracas, Romulo Betancourt moved a nation from dictatorship to a very living and a very hopeful democracy. In Costa Rica and Mexico, and in many other places, new standards were being shaped and old dreams were taking on fresh meaning. Across the hemisphere revolution was in the air, promising these three things: freedom, justice, and progress.;And then all these growing, resistless forces converged on this room where a brilliant new Preside fit of the United States addressed himself to his fellow citizens of this hemisphere. And with unmatched spaciousness of vision John Fitzgerald Kennedy called for "a vast cooperative effort unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose, to satisfy the basic needs of the American people...;And 5 months later--4 years ago today-on the coast of Uruguay, 20 American Republics solemnly resolved to establish and to carry forward the Alliance for Progress.;That act was a turning point, not only in the history of the New World, but in the long history of freedom itself.;The goals were towering, almost beyond achievement. The hopes were soaring, almost beyond fulfillment. The tasks were immense, almost beyond capacity. But entire nations are not stirred to action by either timid words or narrow visions. The faith and the will of millions do not take fire from the brands that are muffled in reluctance and fear. And if the reality of progress was to be slow, the radiance of ultimate achievement must be bright enough to compel the effort and the sacrifice of generations.;If our Alliance was suffused with compassion and idealism, it also responded to the most real and the most urgent necessities of our time. Our continent is in ferment. People long oppressed demanded their share of the blessings and the dignity which the modern world can offer to man. The peaceful democratic social revolution of the Alliance is not the alternative to tranquility and changelessness. It is the alternative, and the only alternative, to bloodshed and destruction and tyranny. For the past is really gone. And those who struggle to preserve it enlist unawares in the ranks of their own destroyers.;We will shape the future through the principles of our Alliance or we will find it swallowed up in violence that is bred of desperation.;How fortunate we are to live in such a time when justice so mingles with necessity, and faith mingles with opportunity.;Almost from the moment of birth, the Alliance for Progress was beset by doubt. But men of rooted faith in every country held firm to the purpose. And if we have not really reached the farthest limit of expectation, we have done much more, indeed, than many ever believed we could do.;FOUR YEARS OF PROGRESS This 4 years has been the greatest period of forward movement, progress, and fruitful change that we have ever made in the history of this hemisphere. And that pace is now increasing.;Last year Latin America as a whole exceeded the Alliance for Progress target of 2 1/2 percent per capita growth rate. Our experts tell me that we will do the same this year. And in the Central American Common Market the growth is almost 7 percent.;A large and swelling flood of resources contributes to this progress. In 4 years the United States alone has contributed almost $4 1/2 billion in grants, in loans, in goods, and in expert assistance. The nations of Latin America have channeled $22-24 billion into development. And more than an extra billion dollars has come from other countries and other international agencies.;At the heart of the Alliance are the twin urgencies of planning and reform. Ten nations have already submitted development programs, and others are on the way. Fourteen nations now have major tax reforms underway, and their rate of tax collection is steadily increasing. Fourteen nations have now instituted land reform programs. Others are confronting the growing importance of population control. One government after another is determined to reconcile reform and economic growth with the struggle against destructive inflation. And this morning I salute those--the people of Brazil--who have helped to lead the way.;AMERICA HELPS In my own country we have constantly worked to improve the speed and the usefulness of our own participation in the Alliance, and we have made remarkable progress. I hope you will listen to this.;In the last year and a half we have loaned over $847 million--and that is almost $150 million more than was loaned in the entire 2 full preceding years combined. The number of loans is increasing. The amount of investment guarantee is on the rise. Housing guarantees alone have gone up 20 times in the last 2 years.;So you see in both the United States and Latin America we are moving more and more swiftly to meet the obligations and to reach the goals that we set in the Alliance for Progress.;HOPE IS BORN And behind the statistics lie the countless stories of human needs that have been met, human suffering that has been relieved, and human hopes that have been fulfilled.;Twenty-five million people--13 million of them little children--are today, as we speak, receiving food from the Alliance programs.;More than 1 1/2 million people already have new homes. A million children now have new classrooms, and 10 million textbooks have already been produced.;Hundreds and hundreds of thousands now can find relief from suffering in more than 850 hospitals and health centers and health units that have been placed into operation already.;More than 100 million people today are protected from malaria. And all across the face of the hemisphere new roads are being constructed. Electric power lines are going up. And institutions for saving and credit and development are already opening new doors.;Yes, these are very important gains. But, perhaps more importantly, the banners of reform, of social justice, of economic progress have been seized by governments and by leaders and by parties throughout this hemisphere. Elections are fought and elections are won on the principles of the Alliance. And where once the light of hope flickered in very few places, today it burns in many nations. In the oppressed countryside and in the desperate slums, growing numbers of people know that far away in distant capitals--under different slogans and with varying success--their leaders are working to brighten their days and to ensure their dignity.;For the fact is, even though the forces of injustice and privilege and tyranny still hold many fortresses, they are actually on the defensive today. And we can say, far more surely than we once could, that their final day is coming.;But whatever we have accomplished, we all know that the road ahead is longer and it is more steep than the way behind. If many have been helped, then there are many more that are still untouched. If some are newly free, there are millions that are still shackled by poverty and disease and ignorance and malnutrition. If we have made more progress than before, as we have, we have made far less than we should and than we must.;TOWARD A BRIGHTER FUTURE So, to this end, we must all increase the efforts that we are now making: first, to build modern industry and the structures on which it rests, to attract a growing flow of private investment and technology to Latin America, to speed up the process of social reform.;But it is not just enough to continue doing what we are doing. From the experience and the achievement and the failures of the first 4 years, we can now shape new directions.;Recently, I received--as did the other American Presidents--a letter from CIAP suggesting changes and new departures. The leadership of this organization is itself one of our very healthiest developments. And I pledge that my Government will review this letter with great care and sympathy.;But from this letter--and from our own experience--we can already see the shape of future emphasis.;First, we must step up our efforts to prevent disastrous changes in the prices of those basic commodities which are the lifeblood of so many of our economies. We will continue-as we did this week in London--to strengthen the operation of the coffee agreement and to search for ways to stabilize the price of cocoa.;We will try to maintain a regularly expanding market for the sugar that is produced by Latin America. And consistent with the CIAP recommendations, I will propose this afternoon that Congress eliminate the special import fee on sugar so that the full price will go to the Latin American producers.;Second, we must try to draw the economies of Latin America much closer together. The experience of Central America reaffirms that of Europe. Widened markets--the breakdown of tariff barriers--leads to increased trade and leads to more efficient production and to greater prosperity.;The United States will, as CIAP suggests, contribute from its Alliance resources to the creation of a new fund for preparing multinational projects. By building area-wide road systems, by developing river basins which cross boundaries, by improving communications, we can all help to dissolve the barriers which have divided the nations.;In addition, I hope the American nations will consider the establishment of a program--patterned after the European Coal and Steel Community--for the production and trade, on a continental basis, of fertilizer, pesticides, and other products that are needed to increase agricultural production. My country stands willing to help in such a venture.;And thus, in ways that he never imagined, we can move much closer to the dream of Bolivar.;Third, we must emphasize the needs of rural Latin America. Here is the scene of the most abject poverty and despair. Here half the people of Latin America live. And it is here, in the countryside, that the foundation of a modern economy will finally be built. Through the diversification of crops, we can decrease dependence on a few export products. Through increasing production, the countries of Latin America can feed their own people. Through increasing farm income, we can provide growing markets for new industry.;And we must, as CIAP also suggests, direct more of our efforts toward those things which directly touch the lives of individual human beings--housing, education, health, and food. And it is not enough simply to say that a growing economy will ultimately meet those needs. Misery and pain and despair exist in the present, and we must fight them in the present with all we have and the best way we can. This is not only the command of compassion. It is, as we all recognize, the counsel of wisdom. For factories and banks and dollars do not alone build a nation. People build a nation. And on those people, on their health and their knowledge and their faith, their participation and their sacrifice, really rests the future of all of us and the future of all nations.;This is the common thread which runs through the Great Society in my country and the Alliance for Progress in all countries.;These are a few--and only a few--of the many tasks which lie before us as we meet here this morning to labor to complete the second revolution of the Americas.;DIGNITY FOR ALL The task of development is a practical process. Development demands skilled leadership. It demands careful judgment. It demands initiative, ingenuity, and imagination that is firmly tempered by possibility. But it also demands something more. For our progress is not its own end. It is an instrument to enlarge the dignity of man. And so we must build on faith and on belief and on those values which are the resistant and enduring mark of our civilization.;This means that each man should have the chance to share in the affairs of his nation. This means that each man should participate in that liberating process of self-rule that we know as democracy. It is fundamental to our Alliance that all of our nations should be free and that all of our people should be a part of that freedom. We have not yet achieved that for all of our countries, indeed for all the people of even my own country. But that is our goal for this entire continent. And, however we build, the Alliance will not be a success until that is accomplished.;It is to protect that right of self-determination that the OAS today works in the Dominican Republic. I know that all of you share the wish that the future government, chosen by the Dominican Republic and by the Dominican people themselves, will be devoted to the principles of liberal democracy and social justice, and that you share as well the intention of my country to try to help them rebuild that memory and to help rebuild that strife-scarred land.;This also means that each man's nation, whether it is great or small, must walk as an equal with all others--free to shape its society, free to select its institutions and free to find its own way to the future so long as it respects the rights of its fellows. And, from that enriching diversity of custom and tradition--practice and the conduct of affairs--I think we will all draw strength and, perhaps even draw wisdom.;This also means that each man must have a chance to share in present benefits and to share in future progress. God did not create any man to live in unseen chains, laboring through a life of pain in order to heap the table of a favored few. No farmer should be enslaved to land that he can never own. No worker should be stripped of reward for toil. No family should be compelled to sacrifice while others escape the obligations of their society. "Indeed," said Thomas Jefferson, "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just." We must surely tremble for our continent as long as any live and flourish protected by the walls of injustice.;PROGRESS WILL FULFILL DREAMS If we follow these commands in all our lands, then progress will fulfill our dreams. But if we sacrifice them to weakness, or interest, or to false promise, then the hand that builds will become the hand of desolation.;I am, as best I can, and best I know how, trying to follow them in my own country. This year new laws will help the old in my country to find health, will help families to supplement the cost of their homes, will help the Negroes to share in democracy, will help the poor to find an exit from poverty, and will help little children to seek learning. For in my Nation, like yours, we are still struggling to find justice for all of our people. And because we are fortunate in abundance, we feel that morality requires that we must also try to help others who seek it for their own people, too.;And there is also something more. The process of development is still an unknown process. Although we mask our uncertainty with charts and tables, calculations and intricate theories, we are all still very uncertain. But one thing we do know. Development is not just a matter of resources, or trade, or production, or even crops. Rather, in some mysterious way, a people--because they have great leaders and because they have great hopes and because they themselves are great--an entire people begin to stir, and to sacrifice and to work. And when they do, a nation begins to move.;And today in this country and, I believe, throughout this continent, this is really beginning to happen.;It is this--not the numbers or reports-which tells us these have been fruitful years, prosperous ones, and that with luck and with skill and with intransigent resolve we will clear away the thousand barriers that lie ahead. But if enough hands grasp them, then all will be allowed to make the journey.;To all that was pledged that momentous August day 4 years ago--and everything promised since then--I here, on this anniversary today, again pledge my administration and my personal life in office.;As for the future, let's leave that to the New World. It will be ours, as it was promised so many years ago.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">August 25, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.;MANNED ORBITING LABORATORY [1.] After discussion with Vice President Humphrey and members of the Space Council, as well as Defense Secretary McNamara, I am today instructing the Department of Defense to immediately proceed with the development of a manned orbiting laboratory.;This program will bring us new knowledge about what man is able to do in space. It will enable us to relate that ability to the defense of America.;It will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight.;It will make it possible to perform very new and rewarding experiments with that technology and equipment.;The cost of developing the manned orbiting laboratory will be $1.5 billion.;Unmanned flights to test launchings, recovery, and other basic parts of the system, will begin late next year or early 1967. The initial unmanned launch of a fully equipped laboratory is scheduled for 1968. This will be followed later that year by the first of five flights with two-man crews.;The Air Force has selected the Douglas Aircraft Company to design and to build the spacecraft in which the crew of the laboratory will live and operate. The General Electric Company will plan and develop the space experiments. The Titan III-C booster will launch the laboratory into space and a modified version of the NASA Gemini capsule will be the vehicle in which the astronauts return to earth.;THE RULE OF LAW IN OUTER SPACE [2.] Even as we meet, Gemini 5, piloted by two very gallant men, backed by hundreds of dedicated space scientists and engineers and great administrators, now orbits the earth as a dramatic reminder that our American dream for outer space is a dream of peace and a dream of friendly cooperation among all the nations of the earth. 1;1 See Item 462.;We believe the heavens belong to the people of every country. We are working and we will continue to work through the United Nations--our distinguished Ambassador, Mr. Goldberg, is present with us this morning--to extend the rule of law into outer space.;We intend to live up to our agreement not to orbit weapons of mass destruction and we will continue to hold out to all nations, including the Soviet Union, the hand of cooperation in the exciting years of space exploration which lie ahead for all of us. Therefore, I have--today, in fact--directed Mr. James Webb, 2 the administrator of our civilian space program, after conferring with the Secretary of State and our Ambassador to the United Nations and others, to invite the Soviet Academy of Science to send a very high level representative here next month to observe the launching of Gemini 6.;2 James E. Webb, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;I hope that he will find it convenient to come. We will certainly give him a warm welcome in America.;NEW GOVERNMENT-WIDE PLANNING AND;BUDGETING SYSTEM [3.] This morning I have just concluded a breakfast meeting with the Cabinet and with the heads of Federal agencies.;I am asking each of them to immediately begin to introduce a very new and a very revolutionary system of planning and programing and budgeting throughout the vast Federal Government, so that through the tools of modern management the full promise of a finer life can be brought to every American at the lowest possible cost. 3;3 See Item 447.;Under this new system each Cabinet and agency head will set up a very special staff of experts who, using the most modern methods of program analysis, will define the goals of their department for the coming year. Once these goals are established, this system will permit us to find the most effective and the least costly alternative to achieving American goals.;This program is designed to achieve three major objectives;It will help us find new ways to do jobs faster, to do jobs better, and to do jobs less expensively.;It will insure a much sounder judgment through more accurate information, pinpointing those things that we ought to do more, spotlighting those things that we ought to do less.;It will make our decision-making process as up-to-date, I think, as our space exploring program.;Everything that I have done in both legislation and the construction of a budget has always been guided by my own very deep concern for the American people-consistent with wise management, of course, of the taxpayer's dollar.;So this new system will identify our national goals with precision and will do it on a continuing basis. It will enable us to fulfill the needs of all the American people with a minimum amount of waste.;And because we will be able to make sounder decisions than ever before, I think the people of this Nation will receive greater benefits from every tax dollar that is spent in their behalf.;APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS OF U.S. MISSION;TO THE UNITED NATIONS [4.] On July the 20th, I named as United States Ambassador to the United Nations a man to whom the sacred cause of peace is an obsession--Justice Arthur Goldberg.;So I am happy this morning to reinforce the United States team at the United Nations with four Americans who also share a passion for peace;--As Ambassador Goldberg's principal Deputy, I am naming a career Ambassador with a distinguished record of more than 20 years in diplomacy--Mr. Charles Yost.;--As Representative to the Security Council, with the rank of Ambassador, I am naming the noted president of Howard University--Dr. James Nabrit, Jr.;--As Representative to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, a famous American who is giving up his seat in Congress to become our new Ambassador-Mr. James Roosevelt, the eldest son of the late beloved Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mr. Roosevelt is with us this morning. Will you please stand, Mr. Roosevelt?;--As Representative to the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, also with the rank of Ambassador, a vibrant, attractive American woman who has already served as the Nation's chief diplomat in both Denmark and Bulgaria--Mrs. Eugenie Anderson of Minnesota.;OTHER APPOINTMENTS [5.] Tomorrow I will sign into law one of the most important hi]Is enacted by Congress this session: the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965. 4 To direct this far-reaching program of promise for the distressed areas all across America, I intend to nominate as Assistant Secretary of Commerce and as Director of Economic Development one of our most brilliant young public servants, the outstanding Administrator of the Small Business Administration-Mr. Eugene P. Foley. Please stand, Mr. Foley.;4 See Item 452.;[6.] I am also pleased to announce this morning the appointment of Mr. Hobart Taylor, Jr., as a member of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Taylor has been Associate Special Counsel to the President since May 1964. He was previously Executive Vice Chairman of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and has largely directed our efforts with the large corporations and institutions of this country in our plans for progress. Will you please stand, Mr. Taylor?;He will be succeeded as my Associate Special Counsel by another talented young lawyer who holds degrees from both Harvard and Yale and now serves as Deputy Special Assistant to the President--Mr. Clifford Alexander, Jr. Mr. Alexander has recently reached the tired old age of 32. Will you please stand, Mr. Alexander?;[7.] It is also a pleasure to announce the nomination this morning of the new United States Attorney for the District of Columbia-it may interest some of you people who live here in the District of Columbia--Mr. David G. Bress. Mr. Bress has not only carried on a very vigorous private practice and civic life but he has taught in the field of law at American University, at Georgetown Law Center, the University of Virginia Law School, and has been head of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia. Will you stand, Mr. Bress?;THE SOVEREIGNTY OF SELF-GOVERNING;PEOPLE [8.] Fifty years ago, President Woodrow Wilson asked, "Just what is it that America stands for? If she stands for one thing more than another, it is for the sovereignty of self-governing people.;So I am very proud of the progress that we are making toward that principle on one front--and I am disappointed at the lack of progress that we are making on another.;REGISTRATION UNDER THE VOTING RIGHTS;ACT [9.] The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission have just reported to me what I think is a truly remarkable story: In the 19 days since I signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 5 which I recommended to Congress and they promptly enacted, already a total of 27,385 Negroes in 13 counties in 3 Southern States have qualified to vote. And they represent nearly one-third of the potential applicants in all those 13 counties.;5 See Item 409.;Only this morning a team of Federal examiners will begin to list voters in the 14th county that has been designated by the Attorney General. That new office will be opened in the town of Prentiss in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi.;I am equally encouraged by the high level of acceptance and I am very pleased with the compliance that we have had in scores of other Southern counties throughout the country.;--A check of 45 counties in Georgia shows already that 99 percent of 2,000 Negro applicants have been registered without any difficulty.;--In 50 Louisiana counties, not a single Negro has been rejected.;--In Mississippi, nearly 12,000 Negroes have been registered by local registrars--over and above those that we mentioned that were registered by Federal examiners. The number of Negro citizens registered in Mississippi has increased 100 percent in the last 6 weeks.;Obedience is always preferable to enforcement. Where enforcement is necessary, we will not hesitate to meet our responsibilities under the law. But the very clear and the very heartening lesson of this wonderful report is that obedience to the law is a fact of life to so many men and women of good will throughout the South.;HOME RULE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA [10.] On another front--here in our lovely Nation's Capital City--"the sovereignty of self-governing people" is still unresolved.;The people of the District of Columbia, I think deserve and I think must and will have home rule. It is an irony and disgrace that having extended self-government already to the Philippine Islands and to Puerto Rico, having enthusiastically recommended democratic principles to nations around the world, nation after nation, after having welcomed Alaska and Hawaii as new States, that somehow some people seem to be afraid to trust almost a million American citizens with the management of their own affairs here in the District of Columbia.;Congress is moving to redeem this disgrace. The Senate--as on at least five different occasions in the past--has acted to pass a good home rule bill containing a solid and a workable charter for home rule.;That bill should come before the House of Representatives very shortly. The limits of reasonable delay have long since been reached and passed.;No one doubts the outcome once that bill finally gets to the floor of the House and the Members are permitted to vote on it. But what is needed this morning is a commitment by the leadership and by the members of both parties, if you please, to the only practical means of getting the bill on the floor, and that seems to be the petition to discharge the House District Committee from further delay of the bill.;Bills have been pending before that committee for year after year after year. So I have, as President, urged the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. McCormack, and the other leaders and members of my own party to lead the way in this movement. But to all of those who believe in our two-party elective system, to all of those who believe in taxation with representation, to those who believe in keeping faith with our own people, I express the hope that you, too, will join us in this effort.;I am now ready to take any questions that you may have to ask.;QUESTIONS;THE STEEL NEGOTIATIONS [11.] Q. Mr. President, the steel negotiators still seem to be considerably apart on an agreement, and a strike is threatened within a week. Would you care to comment on that situation?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think that the steel situation is on almost every citizen's mind in this country. The decisions which will be made in Pittsburgh this week are of vital importance to every person in this country and to people in other parts of the world. There must be continued cost and price stability in our American economy and I expect full and complete responsibility in the current wage negotiations and I expect continued stability in steel prices.;As we meet here today, we are troubled with many questions, but we must never forget that our boys are still fighting in South Viet-Nam and that our economic strength is the keystone of free world peace. It is extremely important to the security that we hold very dear. So the decisions that will be made this week by steel management and by labor in the days that are ahead must certainly take into account the overall greater national interest which is involved.;The Director of the Federal Mediation Service, one of my most trusted public servants, Mr. William Simkin, is in Pittsburgh, and he is there for the purpose of making every contribution he can to assist the parties in reaching a responsible agreement. The eyes of this country are on the leaders of both management and labor. We are expecting and we believe we will receive the responsibility which the national interest requires. 6;6 See Item 483.;VIET-NAM [12.] Q. Mr. President, in World War II there were notable air strikes which completely knocked out, in single raids, vast industrial complexes and transportation facilities, yet in the war in Viet-Nam we read from over there of repeated cases of where it takes several raids to demobilize or deactivate certain industrial installations. I am thinking of the powerplants they were hitting yesterday over and over, and such things as bridges.;Is our current inability to knock out some of these big industrial complexes or railroad staging areas or bridges--is this a purposeful thing to avoid saturation bombing, or is there any other explanation?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I think that our operations have been up to our expectations. I think a review and evaluation of them will reflect that they have been rather effective, and I think that they are in keeping with the planned purpose of their mission.;Q. Mr. President, do you think the so-called white paper issued by House Republicans under the leadership of Congressman Ford 7 has injected undue partisanship into the Viet-Nam situation?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't want to get into any personalities in the matter. I think the issues of war and peace in Viet-Nam are far greater than any personal differences that one might have--for that matter, far greater than any party's.;7 Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, minority leader of the House of Representatives.;I have said on many occasions, and I should like to repeat to the American people, and to Hanoi also, that I am very pleased with the support the American people are giving to the policies of their Government, both at home and abroad. While our men are fighting and dying for freedom in South Viet-Nam, I am going to do everything that I can to support those men and to unite the country behind them.;I think that, generally speaking, the country is united behind them and I think this will be a source of strength to our boys out there. I have received excellent cooperation from the leadership of both parties in the past, and I expect to continue in the future. The boys that are fighting the war are not divided between Republicans and Democrats. The men directing the strategies involved-I don't know what party they belong to.;The distinguished Secretary of Defense, before coming into Government, was a member of a party different from mine. The President with whom I counsel often and who has had the greatest experience in not only political and diplomatic matters, but in matters of a military nature, President Eisenhower, has been a tower of strength to me, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Secretary of Defense, and to the leaders of the Congress.;So I would say that we welcome expressions of viewpoint from the leadership in both parties. There will be times when we don't see everything alike, but that may contribute strength to our system.;I don't think that Hanoi should ever for a moment entertain the illusion that the people of this country are not united in the work of this Government.;THE IMMIGRATION BILL [13.] Q. The congressional session is almost over and what are the prospects of the immigration bill passing, and could you assess for us some of the long-range effects of it if it passes?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know how good a prophet I am. I had put this legislation very high in our list. I think it is extremely important. I have continually urged the leadership to proceed with this consideration. The House has it under study now. I have talked to the Speaker at length, yesterday and again today.;I am sending him a letter later today expressing very strongly the views of the executive branch of the Government again. 8 I am hoping that that bill will pass as reported by the House Judiciary Committee without crippling amendments. It has not been acted upon yet by the Senate Judiciary Committee.;8 See Item 449.;I believe that it should be acted on before the Congress gets out of here. I favor the House bill. I think it will result in a great improvement not only in our relations with other nations but will be very satisfying to large segments of our own people. I believe it will pass. I would like to have the help of all of you, though, in that connection. 9;9 An act to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act was approved by the President on October 3, 1965 (see Item 546).;THE CIVILIAN PAY RAISE BILL AND WAGE-PRICE GUIDELINES [14.] Q. Mr. President, do you believe that the guidelines of your administration and Mr. Kennedy's administration laid down on wage and price stability apply to Federal employees, and if so, do you believe that the civilian pay raise bill now reported out of the House committee violates those guidelines?;THE PRESIDENT. I would think that the Federal Government has a different situation from what we have in certain segments of our private sector, but I would hope that we would never ask for privileges for ourselves in Government that we would not expect private industry to share in.;Therefore, when you make allowances for the difference in public and private employment and the various policies and fringe benefits, I would hope that we could keep our civilian pay structure in line with the guidelines that we recommend for private industry.;I do think the House bill goes too far. I do think that it would violate the guidelines. I do hope that the Congress will carefully and thoroughly consider the destructive effect it would have if we should pass the bill in its present form.;We had a most distinguished panel of most distinguished Americans study this whole subject. They made recommendations.;We would hope that the Congress would enact those recommendations with certain modifications that they thought were required, but certainly not go anywhere near the overall recommendations made by the House committee, because we think that would be very disastrous to our price-wage stability policy in this country and we think it would violate the guidelines. 10;10 The Federal Employees Salary Act of 1965 was approved by the President on October 29, 1965 (see Item 589).;VIET-NAM--OUR DESIRE FOR PEACE [15.] Q. Mr. President, getting back to Viet-Nam for a moment, the other night on television some of your top advisers spoke in a way that seemed rather pointed about the 1954 agreements 11 as a possible basis for a new agreement.;11 The Geneva Accords of 1954, which ended the war in Indochina, were signed by the Government of France and by the government of Ho Chi Minh of North Viet-Nam. The United States was not a party to them.;Does this reflect an administration emphasis and does it reflect a feeling that perhaps somebody is listening to you now, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that we are always hopeful that all the world is aware of our desire for discussions and our desire for negotiations and our desire for peace. I don't think it is really important how much extra you get an hour in your steel contract, or what the increase of Federal pay is, if your boy is going to be drafted tomorrow and going to be called upon to give his life in Viet-Nam.;So peace--peace, that simple little 5-letter word--is the most important word in the English language to us at this time and it occupies more of our attention than any other word or any other subject. We do expect they are listening, we do hope they are listening.;Secretary Rusk, Ambassador Goldberg, Secretary Ball, 12 and all of the other trained diplomats that we have in this country are going to constantly be searching for ways and means to substitute words for guns, and to bring men from the battlefield to the conference table. Our every waking hour is going to be spent trying to find the means for doing this.;12 George W. Ball, Under Secretary of State.;REPEAL OF SECTION 14(B) or THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT [16.] Q. Mr. President, do you still consider the repeal of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act a major legislative goal in this session of the Congress? There seems to be some question in the Senate, sir.;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know of any question. I certainly do.;LOS ANGELES TASK FORCE [17.] Q. Sir, have you been in contact with Governor Collins 13 about the situation in Los Angeles?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;13 LeRoy Collins, Director, Community Relations Service, Department of Commerce, and former Governor of Florida.;Q. Do you have in mind any action which might avert further tension?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. We have detailed action planned that we worked on until late in the evening last night. Mr. Moyers 14 will have a release available for you. We didn't want to take the television time and further time from your questions, but it will be available later in the week. 15;14 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President.;15 See Item 453.;We are appointing a top-flight task force, headed by Deputy Attorney General Ramsey Clark, and they will proceed to Los Angeles at a very early date. The details of their work and their program will be announced as soon as they are available.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [18.] Q. Mr. President, have we come to any closer solution to the problem in the Dominican Republic?;THE PRESIDENT. Ambassador Bunker 16 has done a very exceptional job there. We are very hopeful that we can obtain agreement on provisional government, and that we can set up the guidelines that will result in an election at an early date where the people of that area can have self-determination and can make the selection of their own government officials. We have felt very close to a solution several times, and we never are quite sure when it will come, but we expect it shortly.;16 Ellsworth Bunker, United States Representative to the Organization of American States.;PENDING LEGISLATION [19.] Q. Mr. President, you said yesterday that what you really wanted for your birthday tomorrow were several bills out of committee, but you didn't say what the bills are. Would you care to tell us, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't have the time to review all of my messages. But as I remember it, there are about four bills still in House committees that have not been reported, that are being worked upon.;They include the highway improvement bill, beautification bill, and the heart, cancer, and stroke bill. Larry O'Brien 17 is a much better authority on this than I am. He will be glad to be helpful in that respect. There are some eight bills in Senate committees that still need to be reported.;17 Lawrence F. O'Brien, Special Assistant to the President.;There are a dozen or so bills that have been reported that need to be scheduled. They are either awaiting a rule or awaiting schedule in one body or the other.;There are about six bills in conference, one of which has emerged recently, much to our satisfaction--the foreign aid bill. We are hopeful that all of those measures can be moved. There are relatively few to be reported. There are a good many more to be scheduled. There are only half a dozen in conference.;We think that in a reasonable time, by diligent work--not around the clock, but a full week in the next several weeks--we can complete our program. If we could, we would like to do that, so that the Members could go home and have some rest before coming back in January.;There will be some important messages for them, awaiting them, when they return in January, but we would not expect anything like the volume of substantive legislation next year. We would expect several substantive bills like a transportation policy and like some refinements in our foreign policy, that we will be submitting messages on food and health and things of that nature. But we look forward to the Congress being able to get out of here early next year--I would say certainly far ahead of the end of the fiscal year in June--so that the Members could be at home and could report to the people.;We like for the Republicans and the Democrats all to be home and report to the people what is going on here, what is going on in the world, so they can be fully informed, and we think that it makes for a more united country.;PROGRESS IN VIET-NAM [20.] Q. Mr. President, of late, sir, have you been able to detect any military advantages in Viet-Nam? Have we turned the corner there after it has gone apparently so bad for so long?;THE PRESIDENT. I am always hesitant to make a prophecy about how good things are or how bad they are, because you fellows have a way of remembering what a public official says way back there and feeding it up to him from time to time.;But I think it must be evident to you that your Marines and your other soldiers in the Army, and the men in the Navy and the Air Force have been giving a good account of themselves. And working very closely with the dedicated and patriotic and determined South Vietnamese, always associated with them and working with them, they have been quite effective in the last few weeks.;As I told you, in our last meeting, I plead with my Cabinet every time I see them. I say to Secretary McNamara, "You be sure that our men have the morale, and have the equipment, and have the necessary means of seeing that we keep our commitments in Viet-Nam, and we have the strength to do it.;I say to Mr. Rusk, while he is working with his right hand on strength and stability there and doing the job we are committed to do, "You and Mr. Goldberg and the rest of you, use that left hand and be sure that you do everything to get us away from the battlefield and back at the conference table, if that is possible.;So we are like a man in a ring. We are using our right and our left constantly.;INDONESIA [21.] Q. It seems increasingly possible, Mr. President, that the conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia could erupt into an earthquake that would affect southeast Asia far more gravely than anything that is going on in Viet-Nam today.;Would you assess that danger for us, including the point as to whether you think it is possible to keep Indonesia from completely going into the Communist Chinese orbit?;THE PRESIDENT. I would agree that the whole situation there is very delicate, a matter that requires constant watching. Our Secretary of State is doing that. The President is doing it. We have recently sent to Indonesia one of our most trained and trusted diplomats. 18 We are going to make every contribution that we can to try to preserve peace in that area.;18 Marshall Green, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia.;We think that what we are doing in South Viet-Nam has a very important bearing on the whole sector of that part of the world. I would not want to make any prophecies as to what the final outcome would be, other than we will be hopeful and we will be continuing in our efforts to contribute anything we can to a peaceful solution.;VETO OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION BILL [22.] Q. Mr. President, sir, you vetoed the military construction bill the other day 19 and said you did it because it was repugnant to the Constitution. Some people disagree with you. They think that very clearly, while your powers are limited by the Constitution, the powers of Congress are extensive.;19 See Item 440.;I would refer you to section 8 of the Constitution, where it says that Congress will make all the rules for government and regulation of the land and naval forces. Don't you think you might reconsider that?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, first I reviewed that veto message very carefully late in the evening of the last day with most of my best legal advisers. The statement as I remember it said that the Attorney General informed me that it was repugnant to the Constitution. So I would refer you first to the Attorney General, and I know he would be glad to give great weight to any observations you might have.;I, myself, agree with the Attorney General. I hope the Congress will share that view. I think that we do owe the Congress a reasonable reporting procedure. I indicated in my message that I would willingly make those reports if it could be worked out where it would not adversely affect our military posture or my duties as Commander in Chief.;I genuinely believe that the bill, in the form that I vetoed it, did considerably restrain the Commander in Chief and was not in the national interest.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at the Presentation of Plans for a Park in Johnson City, Texas.</td><td class="c6">August 27, 1965</td><td class="c7">Lady Bird, Mr. Linen, my beloved friends of Johnson City;This is a very proud moment for me and I deeply appreciate, Mr. Linen, what you are doing for this wonderful little city that is made up of so many good people.;It is going to be through public-spirited citizens and public-spirited businesses that we make this great land of ours a more beautiful land in the years ahead.;I have heard a lot of talk during my 35 years in public life about the power of the press, and particularly the power of Life, Time, Fortune, and a few other publications associated with you. But as I look out this afternoon at this vacant lot and I see this beautiful sketch of what it is going to be a few months from now, I am made aware for the first time of the real power of the press to make the trees grow and the flowers bloom. And we welcome it, Mr. Linen.;I guess I shouldn't tell this story, but a friend of mine many years ago was indicted for buying poll taxes down in San Antonio. And they put the witnesses on the stand, and they produced the women that went to the table to pick up their half dollar pieces, they produced the taxicab fellow that took him to the bank where he got the money in a sack, they produced the banker that distributed the half dollars in return for a check from David Dubinsky in New York. And it was about that time that my friend Mayor Maverick sent for me and asked to borrow my lawyer, and the testimony was already in.;The case was made and it was just a matter of moments until the jury rendered its verdict, and my dear, beloved friend Senator Wirtz was called upon to make the argument of defense without ever having heard all the testimony. But he read it quickly, and he said the Mavericks had made a great contribution to Texas. They fought at the Alamo. They had served in our various governments for many years. The then mayor had been a distinguished Member of Congress, and here he was on trial. On trial for what? For being the first man in Texas that could go north and meet this Yankee, David Dubinsky, and get some of that money that we have been sending up there all these years, and bring it back to Texas. And not use it for himself, not appropriate it to his own comforts, but rather to take it and permit poor women to have their very first vote and to have the right of franchise. And he said, "I would think instead of trying him and committing him to a penitentiary that we ought to build a monument to him out here in front of the Alamo!;Now, I don't know how Mrs. Johnson has gone to New York and got you to come down here, but it is a great tribute, I think, to both of you--one, that she would want to go up there and get you, and, next, that you would want to come. And I just can't think of anything that makes me more pleased on my birthday.;Birthdays are a time for reflection, and I have been reflecting all day--with the maritime workers, and with the steelworkers, and the steel companies, with the boys out in Viet-Nam, and some people down in the Dominican Republic, with the spacemen that are circling the globe, and a good many other things--and I have been reflecting all day just how I was finally going to get here to spend the evening with Lady Bird. Because, in case you have not heard it yet, she is rather interested in beautification. And it appears that she not only wants people to say it with flowers, she wants them also to say it with trees. I hope when we meet here again that we'll have more trees and more flowers here on this somewhat rather sacred spot.;I have been trying to see Ohlen Cox out here. I don't know whether he is here this afternoon or not. But I remember--about where that boy is with that orange shirt on there--Ohlen chasing me from in front of that garage and catching me there. He was wrestling with a fellow and they were trying to put each other's shoulders to the mat, and I ran up and kicked both of them while they were down. And he took off after me, and he said, "I'm going to spank you all the way from the garage to your house"--which is right up there.;And he started out, and I was showing the effects of his spanking in a rather loud voice, and my dear old friend, Bud Winters' home was here then--right over there--and as we crossed his front yard and he heard this yelling, he came out on the porch and he stopped Ohlen, and he separated us. And while he and Ohlen were continuing their conversation, I excused myself and went on home.;And little did I recognize then that some day, through the generous spirit and the prosperity of the Time and Life publications, that they would come here and build a beautiful park where the good people--the young people who are here could enjoy it in the daytime, and those in the twilight of their career could come here and sit under its trees on comfortable benches amidst beautiful surroundings and enjoy it in the twilight of the evening of their lives.;It is a great day, and thank you very much.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference at the LBJ Ranch</td><td class="c6">August 29, 1965</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen;[1.] I want to first of all congratulate the press on their new record today. You have just completed a new record of orbits between Johnson City and the LBJ Ranch. I want to congratulate you on your successful reentry.;We have had a very happy and busy birthday weekend. I am very grateful for all the thoughtful expressions which have reached us from so many families across the land and from leaders in other parts of the world.;From the way it has begun I anticipate that this 57th year may be one of the best years, and that is a very happy thought for me. The weekend has been made especially happy by the presence here of so many good and old and trusted, cherished friends.;I am especially happy to have one of my very favorite couples--Mr. and Mrs. Larry O'Brien. 1 Many of you have been writing about Larry's departure from the White House and I can confirm that this afternoon. But I did want him to spend a weekend here in Texas before he departed. I also want to say a word or so about Larry's future in a few moments.;1 Lawrence F. O'Brien, Special Assistant to the President.;The Postmaster General and his lovely wife came down to check on the White House ZIP code. Secretary Rusk and Mrs. Rusk wanted to check up on our relations between the United States and Texas. And I think they have found them generally good the last 24 hours.;Ambassador Goldberg, of course, was eager to come back because he is just naturally more at home in cowboy country.;Seriously though, I do have a statement that I want to make to you before we go back to Washington this afternoon, and that is this;THE GEMINI 5 ACHIEVEMENT [2.] This is a moment of very great achievement not only for Astronauts Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad but for everyone whose hopes have ridden with Gemini 5. 2;2 See Item 462.;I am so happy that Mr. Webb and Mr. Seamans, 3 who had so much to do with directing this very successful venture, are here to share with us the pride we all feel today. And I deeply regret that our late, beloved President Kennedy, under whose leadership all of this work was so carefully planned and thought out, can't be here to enjoy the fruits and success of his planning and his forethought.;3 James E. Webb, Administrator, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and R. C. Searoans, Jr., Associate Administrator.;The successful completion of the 8-day, 3 million-mile flight of the Gemini 5 proves, I think, not only man's capacity for endurance in space but it proves that man is in space to stay.;We can be, and we are, enormously proud of every member of our space team--that means all the scientists and the technicians and the controllers and the trackers. To everyone who contributed in any way, as President of this country, I want, this afternoon, to extend the thanks of the entire Nation for a job well done. To Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, and to their wonderful families, I want to simply repeat again: We are all very deeply proud of you.;The difficulties and disappointments of this flight have served to increase our appreciation and our respect and our trust for the skill and the ability of all the men involved. We can face the challenges and the opportunities with far greater confidence and certainty in the future, and I think this is an unmistakable gain for all of us. 4;4 On August 31, 1965, the White House announced that the President had approved the following policy on the promotion and decoration of astronauts;1. Each military astronaut will receive a onegrade promotion as a direct result of the first successful space flight, but not beyond the grade of colonel in the Air Force and Marine Corps or captain in the Navy. Promotions to general officer rank will be accomplished through usual military selection board process.;2. Each Gemini astronaut will be awarded the NASA Medal for Exceptional Service (or Cluster) after completion of a successful space flight. The NASA Medal for Distinguished Service, the highest award which can be given by that agency, will be awarded for exceptional accomplishments in the Gemini program including, but not limited to, accomplishments in actual flight.;3. Military decorations associated with space flights, such as awards for exceptional heroism or other distinguished service, will be determined on an individual basis consistent with general policy governing the award of traditional military decorations.;Only 7 years ago we were neither first nor second in space--we just weren't in space at all. And as we meet here this afternoon, the capacity of this country for leadership in this realm is no longer in valid question or dispute anyplace in the world. Openly, proudly, we are proceeding on our course, willing always to share our knowledge and our gains with all of mankind. So, I would repeat and I would renew again this afternoon America's invitation to all nations to join together to make this adventure a joint adventure.;This globe seems much smaller today than it has ever seemed before.;Somehow the problems which yesterday seemed large and ominous and insoluble today appear much less foreboding. As man increases his knowledge of the heavens, why should he fear the unknown on earth? As man draws nearer to the stars, why should he not also draw nearer to his neighbor?;As we push ever more deeply into the universe-probing its secrets, discovering its way--we must also constantly try to learn to cooperate across the frontiers that really divide earth's surface.;No national sovereignty rules in outer space. Those who venture there go as envoys of the entire human race. Their quest, therefore, must be for all mankind. And what they find should belong to all mankind. And that is the basis of the program of which our proud astronauts Cooper and Conrad are a part today.;For, as the great Woodrow Wilson said of this country half a century ago, "We ask nothing for ourselves that we do not also ask for all of humanity.;And we ask peace. Peace--and the real opportunity to help our neighbors, to improve the quality of all of our lives, to enlarge the meaning of liberty for all, and to secure for all the rights and dignities intended for man by his Creator.;This flight of Gemini 5 was a journey of peace by men of peace. Its successful conclusion is a noble moment for all mankind, and it is a very fitting opportunity for us today to renew our pledge to continue our search for a world in which peace reigns and in which justice prevails.;To demonstrate the earnestness of that pledge, and to express our commitment to the peaceful uses of space exploration, I intend to ask as many of our astronauts as possible--when Mr. Webb thinks their schedule and program will permit--to visit the various capitals of the world. Some, I hope, will be able to journey abroad very Soon.;Secretary Rusk and Director Webb and I spent a good part of last evening going over the anticipated problems that will arise and the schedules that will have to be worked out. But Gemini is really just the beginning. We resolve to have many more such journeys--in space and on earth--until man at last is at peace with himself.;THE END OF THE SHIPPING STRIKE [3.] I am glad, also, to announce to you today that the eight east coast and gulf shipping companies and three licensed officer unions have reached agreement. So the normal operation of the merchant marine will now be resumed again.;The losses from the 75-day tie-up of a hundred ships can never be recovered. It took too long to settle these cases. We all know that.;But this was very constructive bargaining. More was done during this period than simply putting new patches on the leaky hull of maritime labor relations.;A firm basis has already been laid in these agreements to resolve manning disputes resulting from automation, without interruption of future operations.;New principles of parity have been built into the pattern of these three contracts.;The economic terms are built around specific recognition of established stabilization policies.;Provision has been made for taking a clear look at the questions which really must be faced if the pension plans in this industry are to be found.;These settlements are steps toward a new and a responsible maritime policy for the United States of America. They will give the rule of good sense a much better chance to work in the future. No man has done more to bring about this important settlement-the one that was reached in the wee hours of this morning--than the very able and distinguished Secretary of Labor, Willard Wirtz. He has worked patiently, he has worked tirelessly, he has worked reasonably around the clock. And all of America owes him an enormous vote of thanks.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC [4.] The Secretary of State and I spent yesterday afternoon and last evening and this morning reviewing various matters of interest around the world.;Secretary Rusk reported that in the Dominican Republic the OAS committee is continuing its very patient and determined work for peace.;It is clear now that this work corresponds to the real hopes of the Dominican people and to the hopes of the whole Western Hemisphere. It is also clear that the OAS committee is right in its belief that the time for agreement is now.;We have followed the negotiations closely and we will support the changes which the OAS committee has proposed in its Act of Reconciliation. 5 We believe that these changes strengthen the document by making clearer provisions for the procedure of disarmament, and by reinforcing the authority of what will be a fully sovereign provisional government.;5 On August 31, 1965, the Act of Dominican Reconciliation, proposed by the ad hoc committee of the Organization of American States, was signed at Santo Domingo (OAS doc. 281). A summary of the terms is printed in the Department of State Bulletin (vol. 53, P. 478).;I am confident that the Dominican people and the members of the OAS are one in their belief that any who continue to oppose the OAS solution are serving no true interest of their country or peace in the world. And it is greatly to the credit of the Organization of the American States that all members of its committee and all officers of the Inter-American Peace Force are doing their dead level best to bring all sides to agreement on the OAS proposal in its present form.;THE KASHMIR ISSUE [5.] The Secretary and I also discussed the tense and difficult situation in Kashmir. We are naturally greatly concerned over any flare-up involving India and Pakistan. Our long-standing and our very consistent stance has always been that the Kashmir issue must, and should be, solved by peaceful means. The U.N. is already involved, and we hope that the constructive efforts of the Secretary General may be successful there.;I might add that we are also always acutely interested in the course of affairs in the subcontinent in general. This is an area to which the United States has provided truly massive assistance and to whose people the United States is deeply attached.;THE YEMEN AGREEMENT [6.] In the Middle East, we are happy to see the statesmanlike agreement between King Faisal and President Nasser, 6 which seems to offer great promise of a peaceful settlement in Yemen. This crisis has long been a very disruptive element in the relations between our two friends. We share their confidence that this long-festering issue is on the road to settlement by negotiation rather than force, and that is most encouraging.;6 King Faisal of Saudi Arabia and Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of the United Arab Republic.;THE NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA [7.] In Geneva today, our negotiators are continuing their efforts to make progress toward a sound international agreement to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. The cause of peace has no more urgent task.;We regret very much that some are still unwilling to join in serious negotiations on the false grounds that our proposals would permit nuclear proliferation in Europe.;In the same way, we regret that these proposals have been misunderstood by others as if they interfered with the legitimate defensive interests of any of the NATO allies. They do nothing of the sort, and I am glad to say that we have had full consultation and understanding with such outstanding leaders as Chancellor Erhard 7 on this point.;7 Ludwig Erhard, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.;APPOINTMENT OF AMBASSADOR TO POLAND [8.] Early in 1964, speaking at VMI, I pledged my administration to a policy of building bridges across the gulf which has divided us for more than two decades from the people of Eastern Europe.;I said then "They will be," I said, "bridge" of increased trade, of ideas, of visitors, and of humanitarian aid.;Our hopes for the people of these countries are identical to their own aspirations for their own future. We want to strengthen their ability to shape their own society. And we seek to bring every European nation closer to its neighbors in the ties of peace.;And so today I am very pleased to announce one of the most important steps that this Nation has yet taken to implement that policy: I am asking a member of my Cabinet, a vigorous, intelligent, highly trained, and deeply committed public servant--Postmaster General John Gronouski--to serve as United States Ambassador to Poland.;I have discussed this assignment at great length with Secretary Rusk and other top key officials in the Department of State. And we believe that Mr. Gronouski's appointment reaffirms our strong desire for increased trust and friendly cooperation between Poland and the United States.;Mr. Gronouski is going to Warsaw to do everything in his power to further increase understanding and goodwill between Poland and our country. He is a grand and a very warm human being who enjoys people. His background and his experience uniquely qualify him to translate American ideals to Poland and Polish ideals to America.;I have asked Mr. Gronouski to say to the peoples and to the leaders of Poland that a deep and historic bond exists between Poland and the United States. Let, therefore, trust grow between us. Let us strengthen that bond, and let us work together for the peace and the liberty that we all seek for all peoples everywhere.;John Gronouski is the man, I think, that can carry that message.;America is in his blood, but so is Poland.;He was born the grandson of a Polish immigrant. He is a member of the Polish Institute of the Arts and Sciences of Chicago, a director of the Pulaski Foundation, the honorary chairman of the Committee for an Endowed Chair in Polish Studies at the University of Chicago. In 1963 he became Postmaster General by selection of President Kennedy. He was the first American of Polish descent to ever serve in the Cabinet. And it was my great pleasure to reappoint him to the Postmaster Generalship last February.;But John Gronouski is more. He is one of the very few men with a doctor of philosophy degree ever to sit in the Cabinet. And as an expert on international economics and on government finance, he established a most outstanding record as commissioner of taxation for one of the great, progressive States in the Union--Wisconsin. He is a talented administrator who has opened up new paths of progress for the postal service of the United States.;Just as another very extraordinary American-who I am delighted to see with us today--Ambassador Arthur Goldberg, left the Supreme Court to accept a very extraordinary and highly significant diplomatic assignment, John Gronouski is now leaving the Cabinet with a distinguished record and high honor to serve his President and his country.;And he is, by the way, enhancing a noble and unique tradition. For the man who really set up our postal service, our first Postmaster General, also went on to later serve his country as Ambassador. His name was Benjamin Franklin.;APPOINTMENT OF POSTMASTER GENERAL [9.] Now to succeed John Gronouski as Postmaster General, I have chosen a man widely recognized as a very talented and ardent practitioner of government, a very skilled manager and organizer whose endless capacity for work and clear vision of the greater public good have earned him immense respect and affection among all who know him. He has been Special Assistant to the President for Congressional Relations, his name is Lawrence F. O'Brien.;Larry O'Brien's credentials are as impressive as the job of Postmaster General is demanding. His appointment recognizes merit and recognizes demonstrated ability in government. He is a veteran of 3 years in the Army. He was for 17 years a businessman in Massachusetts. In 1960 he served as national director of organization in the late beloved John F. Kennedy's campaign for the Democratic nomination for President, and later as national director of organization for the Kennedy-Johnson campaign.;He came to the White House in 1961 as President Kennedy's Chief Assistant for Congressional Relations. He became the key legislative architect of the New Frontier. After the tragedy of November 22, 1963, he stayed on--at the President's request--to help enact legislation that meant so much to President Kennedy and to the Kennedy-Johnson administration.;I know of no single individual who has contributed more to the enactment of legislation that touches the lives of more Americans than Larry O'Brien.;From voting rights to medical care, from the tax cut to the war on poverty, from the Peace Corps to education, Larry O'Brien has expressed his compassion for people in the enactment of major legislation.;He enjoys the high regard of Congress and the executive branch of Government. He will be warmly welcomed into the Cabinet by his new colleagues. I have conferred with the leadership of the Congress and they expressed their great pleasure also. We all know him to be a man concerned not only with the process of government but with the philosophy of government.;Wise counselor, gifted strategist, efficient manager, warm humanitarian, he is a man who-as the respected Business Week magazine pointed out last April--has earned the title of "the 11th Cabinet member.;So I am very proud this afternoon to make him a member of the Cabinet in fact as well as in the magazine and in reputation. He will continue to be a very strong right arm to the President. Don't be surprised if you see him on the Hill occasionally.;But let me caution you, Larry--just because Ben Franklin went to Paris and John Gronouski is going to Warsaw, that doesn't mean that you are ever going to Dublin.;I'll be glad to take any questions you may care to ask, and after the television time is over Secretary Rusk and Ambassador Goldberg and Administrator Webb will be glad, for a few minutes before you leave, to give you any material on background that you would like to have.;QUESTIONS STEEL MEDITATION EFFORTS [10.] Q. Mr. President, what do you hear from the steel strike?;THE PRESIDENT. We had a very lengthy report this morning. And the special mediators I asked to go up yesterday were meeting again, first, with the steel management, and later with the steel union. They have really made no progress since they went there yesterday. They have been going into the facts of the situation and we have carefully evaluated the factual report they have brought us. We are asking them to get back in touch with us after lunch this afternoon and we will give further attention to it during the day and the evening.;VIET-NAM [11.] Q. Mr. President, the Russians are reported to be saying that North Viet-Nam might be willing to start negotiations if there is another cessation of U.S. bombing. Do you credit these reports and, if so, are there any plans for another temporary halt on the bombing?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know where the reports are. I have not seen them, and we hear a lot of reports but so far as I am aware there is nothing official about them, and I expect some newspaperman is speculating.;Q. Mr. President, there have been a lot of published reports this week about new initiatives, perhaps on the fringe of Hanoi. Are we measurably any closer to peace talks? Can you discuss these reports and give us some background on it?;THE PRESIDENT. I would say that reports come and go but there is not anything that I can add to what I have said in my last press conference. The word "peace" is a great word in our vocabulary. We are searching for it. We are doing everything we can to prevail on all parties concerned to leave the battlefield and go to the conference table. But I have nothing official, or nothing reliable, that would indicate that any of the parties of interest are ready to do that at this time.;EFFECT OF A STEEL STRIKE [12.] Q. Mr. President, what would the steel strike do to the national economy? 8;THE PRESIDENT. Well, it would be very damaging. It would depend on how long it went on, to say the least. It is something we don't want to happen. I have appealed to both management and labor to let collective bargaining work, and I hope that it will be successful. We are going to do everything we can to ask both parties to be responsible, and to act in the national interest, and I hope and believe they will.;8 See Item 483.;SCHEDULE FOR A FLIGHT TO THE MOON [13.] Q. Mr. President, in light of the success of the Gemini 5 flight, where do we stand in our schedule to get a man on the moon? Can we do it in this decade, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I think that our schedule is going along very well. That's been our hope. Director Webb can go into further details with you in the backgrounder following this conference, but I don't want to be overoptimistic. A lot of hard work is ahead of us. It is going to be very costly in both time and resources. But I know of no project our Government has ever undertaken that has been better managed, that received more cooperation from the 20 thousand-odd business companies in this country, and all the workers belonging to labor, and the fine management team of Webb, Dryden, 9 and Seamans. And I think that we will continue to advance and make progress and meet our goals.;9 Hugh L. Dryden, Deputy Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.;STEEL MEDIATION EFFORTS [14.] Q. Mr. President, is there anything further you can do to put off the steel strike?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I'm going to do everything I can to avoid it. We have to take one step at a time and see what progress is made, but I have no doubt but what management wants to avoid a strike if it can. I know that the workers want to avoid the costly price that the strike would bring. And we are trying to work it out in the American way, and I hope we'll be able to. If not, we'll have to look to the national interest and see what it requires and then carry it out.;ALLEVIATION OF RACIAL TENSIONS [15.] Q. Mr. President, the other day, in the wake of what happened in Los Angeles, 10 you warned against further violence and lawlessness in the city streets, and afterward the Republican leader of the House 11 suggested that by your remarks you might tend to incite the very thing that you are trying to prevent. Do you have any comment on this?;THE PRESIDENT. I would certainly hope not. I don't want to incite anything. I think we recognize that we have very serious problems in this area. And I think the Congress has acted very forthrightly and very effectively-at least most of the Congress--to find the answer to this problem.;10 See Items 426, 453.;11 Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, minority leader of the House of Representatives.;The higher education bill passed with only 22 votes against it last week. The poverty bill passed with an overwhelming vote. Both of those measures will be helpful to us. The elementary education bill passed by a rather substantial vote.;I think this Congress has done a great deal in the way of voters' rights. And what I said at the White House, I would remind you all, is something that I think every American recognizes is a fact. We have a good many of these problems that we need to face up to, and I don't think any Congress has ever faced up to them better than this Congress.;We have not concluded our work, but we are rapidly approaching the end. And if we can get the legislation we have asked, we can do our planning, we can make some mass assaults on these conditions, where 35 or 40 percent of the young people in a given area are unemployed, and can get them back to work, or get them back to school, or get them back in better housing and better living conditions.;I think that we will find an answer to these problems, and that is what I am trying to get the country to do. Housing, poverty, education, medical care, home rule--all of these are measures that I would hope the Congress would carefully consider and act upon, and they have done that in most fields. Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

While there are still grave problems to be faced by the Dominican people, the way has been opened for an end to strife and for the choice of leaders through the process which all free men cherish. The hopes of democratic and peaceful men the whole world over have taken new strength and nourishment from these events today.;The road to peace and freedom is always hard, and wherever this road is being traveled successfully, there can always be found many men and women who have given of themselves and of their talents in great measure. The Dominican Republic is no exception, and there have been many who have done just this. All democratic elements in the hemisphere are indebted to the Dominican leaders who have worked for this agreement, to Ambassadors Penna Marinho, Clairmont Duenas, and Bunker for their outstanding statesmanship, and to the many others who contributed so much in order that this achievement could be made possible.</td></tr>

Special thanks must go to Ambassador Penna Marinho, Ambassador Clairmont Duenas, and our own Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker.;There are still very grave problems facing the Dominican people. But the way has finally been opened for an end to strife and for the choice of leaders through the process which all free men cherish. I am certain that the hopes of men who really love peace and the democratic process have taken new strength from these developments and these events.;In a very short time there will be a provisional government in the Dominican Republic. This government will need the energetic support of the whole Western Hemisphere as it sets about the work of restoring peace and trying to rebuild the entire Dominican economy. The United States and the Organization of American States will work together in these new tasks--shoulder to shoulder--as we have worked together in these recent months. We all have the same objective. We all seek the same goals--peace and prosperity for the hemisphere.;Thank you very much.;[After reading the foregoing statement the President made the following remarks.];I have the very great honor of having the distinguished Ambassador from Argentina, Dr. Mora, the Ambassador from Bolivia, and the Ambassador from Colombia. They happened to be having lunch over in the White House--off the Fish Room, they serve much better food there than in the mansion--with some of my associates. I asked them to join me here.;Ambassador Mora, would you like to say something?;AMBASSADOR MORA. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I am very happy on this occasion to express my recognition to all the government members of the Organization of American States for their participation in this great effort for the establishment of peace and democratic procedures in the Dominican Republic.;This is a demonstration of the capacity of the Organization of American States to obtain a solution to such a delicate situation. And I want also to express my deep appreciation to President Johnson for his personal interest in the cause of peace in the Dominican Republic.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Your energetic and imaginative work in Santo Domingo helped to lay the basis for the later efforts of your colleagues in the OAS Committee, and your persistent devotion to peace and to democratic institutions has been a continuous force for good, in the best tradition of the Americas.;I send thanks also, through you, to the whole Organization of American States, which you serve so ably as Secretary General. The OAS has met a major challenge, and it has been strengthened by the success of its patient effort for peace.;With warm personal regards;Sincerely;LYNDON B.

Your patience and skill and determination have once again been of the greatest value to your country--and a source of great strength for me.

Johnson: Statement by the President Announcing U.S. Recognition of the New Dominican Government.</td><td class="c6">September 4, 1965</td><td class="c7">THIS PAST WEEK, Dominican leaders, with important assistance from the OAS, agreed on the establishment of a provisional government under the leadership of Dr. Hector Garcia-Godoy. This action marked the end of an impasse which had brought danger and hardship to the Dominican people during 4 long and difficult months.;Last night, the provisional government, officially installed, announced its adherence to the Dominican Republic's international obligations, pledged its allegiance to the high purposes of economic, social, and democratic progress, and requested recognition by the nations of the world. This action marked the beginning of a new road to peace, freedom, and hope for the Dominican people.;Today, after consultation with other OAS States, the U.S. Government is extending recognition to the new provisional government.;On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend best personal wishes to the distinguished new President and to the brave Dominican people.;President Garcia-Godoy's government will face many great and hard tasks over the coming months--as he leads his country to free elections and as he moves to rebuild his country's economy.;In the difficult but promising days ahead, I want President Garcia-Godoy and the Dominican people to know that they have our full support.;We are already discussing on an urgent basis the resumption of certain projects which have been interrupted since the tragic days of last April.;We are ready to participate fully with the OAS, its committee on the Alliance for Progress and international financial institutions in the important rehabilitation effort that lies ahead. We earnestly hope that, on request of the Dominican Government, the OAS will take the lead in this great enterprise.;Meanwhile, preliminary discussions have established an immediate need for approximately $20 million in assistance and we hope that arrangements can soon be concluded with the provisional government to make this amount available. These funds will help to defray some of the immediate needs of economic reconstruction, which include the rehabilitation of private industry, a program of public works, and temporary financing of some of the essential operating expenses of the government and key public enterprise.;While no one knows better than the Dominican people how much work it will take to clear the road to peace, progress, and democracy, they should also know that the whole hemisphere shares their hope for a bright future and will work shoulder to shoulder with them to make this hope a reality.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">February 11, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. I had some announcements I thought maybe you would want before the weekend is over.;ANNOUNCEMENT OF APPOINTMENTS;[1.] I am appointing as Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Mr. Dixon Donnelley, who is presently serving as Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs.;He is a Foreign Service officer. You can get the details on his background. He is succeeding Mr. Greenfield, who is leaving shortly.;I am appointing Mr. Lee White, who is presently Special Counsel to the President, as Chairman of the Federal Power Commission. You can get the details from Mr. Moyers.;I am appointing Mr. Staats, Deputy Director of the Bureau of the Budget, as Comptroller General. Mr. Staats joined the Bureau in 1939, and was born in Kansas in 1914. He married a daughter of former Congressman Rich of Pennsylvania. I think you all know him well.;I am appointing Mr. Harry McPherson to succeed Mr. White as Counsel to the President. There is a good deal of information on Harry here. I didn't know that much about him myself.;I am appointing Cliff Alexander as Deputy Special Counsel.;PRESS SECRETARY;[2.] I am appointing Bob Fleming as Deputy Press Secretary, but he will be my Press Secretary from time to time as well, and help out generally. Robert Fleming is formerly of the Capital Times, Milwaukee Journal, Newsweek, and present Washington Bureau Chief of the ABC.;I think that is all I have. I will answer any questions.;Q. Mr. President, what happens to Bill Moyers after that? Where does he go?;THE PRESIDENT. Bill will continue to go wherever the ball is and work wherever we need him. There are a good many different places. As his tide implies, he will be Special Assistant to the President.;Q. Mr. President, do you mean, sir, that Bob Fleming is now the White House Press Secretary?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I think the press prefers that we have one man who does more of the briefing than anybody else called the Press Secretary. I have talked to some of them about it. We are going to call for your convenience and pleasure--Bob will be Deputy Press Secretary for the moment, but he will be doing a good deal of the Press Secretary's work.;As far as I am concerned, I will want to call him my Press Secretary and try to satisfy both of you.;Q. Mr. President, if he is yours, he can be ours, too.;THE PRESIDENT. Smitty 1 didn't think so. I talked to him about it.;1 Merriman Smith of United Press International.;Q. Pull together.;Q. Mr. President, will Bill Moyers be working on national security affairs primarily?;THE PRESIDENT. No, he will be doing just what I said. I couldn't give him one answer and you another. He will be working on anything I want him to from time to time. It may be a personnel matter. This afternoon it was, for an hour. Tomorrow it may be a legislative matter. The next day it may be an appointment matter, as it was yesterday. A good deal of the time it will be nursing the press.;Q. Mr. President, will Mr. Laitin 2 remain, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;2 Joseph Laitin, an assistant press secretary.;Q. Mr. President, Mr. Moyers' tide will be that of Press Secretary?;THE PRESIDENT. Special Assistant to the President. It has always been that. You can call him Press Secretary, though, if it gives you any thrill.;Q. Mr. President, I would like to know your preference.;THE PRESIDENT. I would say Special Assistant to the President. That is his title. But I talked to some of the boys in the press about it, and they say that since Bill does a good deal of the briefing, they want one man to be responsible. They would like to call Bill the Press Secretary. I don't object to what you call him. I am ultimately responsible and I will take it all. If you can't get to me, you can get to Bill. If you can't get to him, you can get to Fleming. If you can't get to him, you can get to whoever else is around.;I have no objection to your getting to anyone you want to if they know what I am thinking. My special problem here with 11 Cabinet officers and 10 Special Assistants is for them to be all on the same course at the same time and all know what the policy is, without one having one idea and another one another. Sometimes I can't get them all briefed, but I can brief whoever is briefing that day, and Bill Moyers.;I do hope Fleming will take over some of the heavy briefing because I think it is too much for Bill with what else he is doing, too.;QUESTIONS ON APPOINTMENTS;[3.] Q. Is Mr. Fleming here, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Welcome aboard.;MR. MOYERS. And so is Dixon Donnelley, Mr. President.;THE PRESIDENT. And here is Dixon Donnelley, who will be over with Mr. Rusk. 3;3 Dean Rusk, Secretary of State.;Q. What becomes of the present Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Mr. Greenfield?;THE PRESIDENT. Ma'am?;Q. What becomes of the present Assistant Secretary of State, Jim Greenfield?;Does Mr. Donnelley replace him?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. Is he resigning, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. That is right.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC;[4.] Q. Mr. President, are you open for other questions?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I have been waiting on them, Smitty.;Q. I wonder, sir, if you could appraise this situation in the Dominican Republic, the resumption of fighting down there seeming to be increasing a little each day. Are you at all concerned about this?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I am concerned. I deeply regret what is taking place there. I am very hopeful that the President will be able to bring peace to the island as early as possible. It is a very difficult situation.;CONGRESSIONAL VIEWPOINTS ON FOREIGN POLICY;[5.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Gore 4 said, in effect, what he and some Senators have done is go over your head to the American people and reach you that way. Do you think that is a legitimate approach?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it is always legitimate to go to the American people with a program or any problem you have. They are the bosses in this country, and they are the ones that make the decision, and they are the ones to whom we are all responsible.;4 Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.;Any Congressman, any Senator, has a right and a duty to submit his program to the people and get their support.;FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON VIETNAM;[6.] Q. Do you think that the hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee are helpful, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't see that I would be the proper one to judge, because I haven't had the intimacy with them that the members of the Committee have. But that is a matter for the Senate to determine. I wouldn't find any fault with any committee having any hearings at any time, as long as they are conducted in an atmosphere of objectivity, fairness, judiciousness.;I have not observed that these have been conducted in any other manner, so far as I can see. They had Secretary Rusk for awhile and he is going to be appearing again, and General Taylor. 5 They have had General Gavin. 6 From what I read about him, his program or his testimony, and what I have seen about Mr. Kennan's, 7 I don't see that they have done any harm to anybody.;5 Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, Special Consultant to the President, former U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.;6 Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin, former Chief of Research and Development, Army General Staff.;7 George F. Kennan, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and to Yugoslavia.;I think it is a question for everyone fully exploring the problems that face our country coming up with the best recommendations and best programs they can. I have tried to take every recommendation submitted to me and carefully consider it and pursue it to the extent I thought justified. I will continue to do that. I welcome any suggestions any of you have.;Have you some, Pete? 8;8 Raymond p. Brandt of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.;Q. No, but I would like to ask you about the fact that you used to have some official concern here about how Hanoi might misread this kind of debate in the Senate as well as the demonstration. Do you think they might misread the present Senate hearings and think there are differences in the country which are not really legitimate?;THE PRESIDENT. I haven't read the transcript of the hearing, but I gather from what General Gavin said in summary there is not a great deal of difference between what he and Kennan are saying and what the Government is doing. No one wants to escalate the war and no one wants to lose any more men than is necessary. No one wants to surrender and get out. At least no one admits they do. So I don't see that there is any great difference of opinion. If there is, I guess in their report they will recommend the program. Whatever it is, we will be glad to consider what any Senator says.;I had a letter from Congressmen giving me their views, and I thanked them and considered them and tried to tell them what the Government was thinking here. I had a letter from some Senators and they gave me their views, and I thanked them and told them I appreciated it and said to them substantially what I said to the Congressmen. 9;9 See Items 23, 36.;This was our feeling. But as, if, and when the circumstances justify other decisions, why, we will make them, but we are always glad to have their suggestions and recommendations if they have any. Some of them recommended the pause, and some recommended resuming the bombing, and some recommended not resuming the bombing. We carefully considered it.;I was just looking at one Senator's record this morning who was making some recommendations. I asked to see his card and I had seen him 21 times last year. I think it is very important that we give careful and thorough consideration to every suggestion made by every Senator of either party, and every Congressman and every citizen that We Can.;I get almost a hundred letters a week from the boys in Vietnam and I try to read them and get help from them. I do get strength from them.;QUESTIONS ON VIETNAM POLICY;[7.] Q. Mr. President, earlier this week in Honolulu, General Ky, the Prime Minister of South Vietnam, said that they would not negotiate with the Vietcong. Do you think this position would present any difficulties should negotiations develop at some future date?;THE PRESIDENT. When you get Hanoi ready to negotiate, I think that the viewpoint of all the people interested in negotiations can be considered and no one will have any trouble hearing them. If you are prepared to produce Hanoi, I am prepared to negotiate.;Q. Mr. President, how is your mail in the country running on this issue?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that there are a good many people in the country that are troubled about Vietnam and wish we could find some way to negotiate, but I think the country overwhelmingly supports the position that we have taken. I believe that the Members of the House and the Senate do likewise.;All these days and weeks, all that has been said and done, I don't see any real program that anyone has presented that offers a clear alternative to recommend itself in preference to what we are doing. General Gavin didn't, or Mr. Kennan. They both are expublic servants. General Gavin--I remember hearing him when he resigned from the Army because he felt that he wanted to leave. I remember his testimony then and I saw it in the papers the other day. I didn't see anything that I could really catch onto as any great difference between us.;He said he had been misunderstood on the enclave thing. He said he didn't want to get out. He said he didn't want to escalate. That is the way we feel about it.;Mr. Kennan said he hadn't ever been to Southeast Asia. He started off by saying that he didn't want to escalate, but that he didn't want to pick up and run out.;So those are the only two experts that I have seen put on, and I have been given that feeling.;Q. Mr. President, Mr. Kennan apparently believes that withdrawal, if we left South Vietnam, would have a bad effect on other countries--or rather he does not believe it would have a bad effect on other nations. How do you feel about that?;THE PRESIDENT. I didn't see that in his testimony. When I get the testimony I will read it and give careful consideration to any recommendations that he makes.;HONOLULU CONFERENCE ON VIETNAM;[8.] Q. Mr. President, when you were in Los Angeles reporting on the Honolulu conference, 10 you listed 11 items which you said were discussed, and you said that in all these fields you set targets, concrete targets.;10 See Items 53-56.;Would it be possible to get a list of these concrete targets?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't have any. I think what I had in mind there was saying that we hoped to make certain progress in certain fields. And we expect to have another conference after a reasonable length of time, in which we will take the hits, runs, and errors and see what we have achieved, and everybody would be answerable, so to speak, as to the progress they have made and whether or not they are nearing their goals.;We distributed 8 million textbooks and hope to distribute 16 million. The next time we meet we will probably have 12 million distributed.;We have doubled the rice production and we hope to substantially increase that after these technicians we have selected from all over the country get through with their study and their recommendations.;Then we will get General Westmoreland, Prime Minister Ky, and Ambassador Lodge, 11 the civilian counterparts to Mr. Westmoreland, and we will keep score and come back.;11 Gen. William C. Westmoreland, Commander, United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, Nguyen Can Ky, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vietnam, and Henry Cabot Lodge, U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam.;I hope to be in Honolulu in the next few months, maybe in the middle of the year, and see what has been done. I thought it was good that we could go there and have the Government, and the military leader, General Westmoreland, and the Ambassador, and the Deputy Ambassador, 12 meet with the Vice President, the Secretary of Agriculture, and technicians, and try to expose to the world for 3 days what this country is trying to do to feed the hungry, and to educate the people, and to improve the life span for people who just live to be 35 now, to show that we really had goals, we had targets, and we were going to put the very best that we had into it.;12 William Porter, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam.;A lot of our folks have felt that it is just a military effort. We don't think it should be that, and we don't want it to be that. We have social objectives. One of our main goals is to defeat social misery. We were very glad to see the leader of their Government state what he did in the January 15th speech.;We want to follow up and try to contribute everything we could to realizing that objective. A good many Senators and a good many Congressmen have felt that we ought to place more emphasis in this field. That is what I was trying to do, and that is what I think we did do.;The tendency is for all of us to talk about casualties and military operations, bombs, ammunition, and things of that kind. I was trying to talk about some of these other things that I thought were quite important.;VISIT OF MRS. GANDHI;[9.] Q. Mr. President, have any definite arrangements been made for Mrs. Gandhi 13;13 Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of India. See Items 148, 149, 152. to come and visit you?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We have told her she would be very welcome. She has told us that she wants to come as early as possible. I had a letter from her last night. She doesn't say when she is coming, but she wants to come at as early a date as possible.;I would say you can say that it is believed that she will try to be here in the latter part of March or April. But the Vice President is discussing with her, in response to her letter of February 9th, some of the matters that she mentioned, such as food, economic aid, and things of that type.;FUTURE HONOLULU CONFERENCE;[10.] Q. Mr. President, will the leaders of Vietnam with whom you met in Honolulu be invited to Washington?;THE PRESIDENT. No, we have no plans to.;Q. Mr. President, but the next meeting would be, again, in Honolulu?;THE PRESIDENT. We haven't definitely set a meeting, but we are going to review the hits and runs and errors down the road in the next few months, and follow through on these various missions after they have had a chance to get their recommendations put in practice.;Agriculture will come back in the next few days and then the education people will go and work for a while. They will come back and then the health people will go and work for a while. Then the AID people.;I spent some time this morning talking to Mr. David Bell 14 and his group, and they are working on price problems, inflation problems, import problems--things of that kind.;14 David E. Bell, Administrator, Agency for International Development.;Then we will probably, after those three or four groups come in, have a meeting. I am guessing now, but I would guess in June or July we would have an accounting, so to speak, kind of an examination--like Luci's 15 finals that she takes.;15 Luci Baines Johnson, the President's daughter.;We would say what we have done in these fields and kind of check up. We are very anxious to make a maximum effort in these fields because we want to show the people what I tried to bring out in my Baltimore speech, 16 and what we are trying to do in a good many parts of this country.;16 For the President's address in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins University on April 7, 1965, see 1965 volume, this series, Book I, Item 172. day for me. I am very happy with it. I just hope it stays that way.;We have increased the number of children in school from some 300,000 to 1 million 300 thousand--multiplied several times.;We have doubled the rice production. Each one of these things--we built 6,500 classrooms--all of those things we were talking about the other day.;We are saying: "Let's get going" and "Let's move into high gear." We are spending more economic money in that country than any place in the world and we desire doing it expeditiously, efficiently, and getting results. "We are going to call you back in here," and I am going to look at them and see what they have done.;PRESIDENTIAL RATINGS IN POLLS;[11.] Q. Mr. President, a recent Gallup Poll showed that while high, your rating is about the lowest it has been since you have been in office, and I wonder how you interpret this?;THE PRESIDENT. I haven't noticed much change. It is about the same thing every;FURTHER QUESTIONS ON VIETNAM;[12.] Q. Mr. President, did the Vietnamese leaders indicate to you that they think they can find the personnel to carry out the rural reconstruction programs?;THE PRESIDENT. The Vietnamese leaders were very hopeful and appeared to be very earnest. And both Ambassador Lodge and General Westmoreland were quite encouraged, when they left, about the results of our 3 days of discussion.;I don't know how to predict the outcome of 3 days with people that you don't know and that you haven't known before personally.;I had just met General Westmoreland once. That was one reason I wanted to spend some time with him. I saw him at West Point and liked him, and admired him. I read his cables every day and I just wanted to see the fellow who was writing them.;I would say the conference was, I thought, productive and addressed itself to constructive subjects. I think the reaction I have had from the country was that they were glad that their Government was putting the spotlight on education and health and production, and higher living standards, trying to get other people to put proper emphasis on it, too.;Q. Mr. President, do you have any plans, sir, to ask Congress for a resolution or some other formal expression of approval of the administration's policy in Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. I have a resolution saying that, I have one passed in August, I think, 1964. You read that one. I think if you get familiar with it, it pretty well explains my view. 17;17 A joint resolution to promote the maintenance of international peace and security, in Southeast Asia was approved by the President on August 10, 1964 (Public Law 88-408, 78 Stat. 384).;Q. Mr. President, could you say what you feel are the drawbacks, if any, to the enclave theory that Mr. Kennan set forth yesterday?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't want to debate with Mr. Kennan. I don't think Mr. Kennan follows the enclave theory as I read it. I would be glad to have you give me a memo on what Mr. Gavin and Mr. Kennan advocate and let me look at it, and then I will talk to you and give you my views. From what I have seen, I don't see any diversions.;Most people wish we weren't out there, most people wish we didn't have a war, most people don't want to escalate it, and most people don't want to get out.;U.N. CONSIDERATION;[13.] Q. Mr. President, has there been any change in the war or peace picture since you resumed the bombing and went to the U.N.?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know how to answer that. I just don't know.;Q. Mr. President, Ambassador Goldberg 18 gave us the impression we were not pressing the Vietnam situation through the U.N. but hoping the U.N. would get it to Geneva. Is that a correct assessment of that?;THE PRESIDENT. The Ambassador is the best source for the Ambassador's impressions. I think we made our position clear to the U.N. We made it clear to the world. What the U.N. does about it is a matter for them. I don't want to interfere in their matters.;18 Arthur J. Goldberg, U.S. Representative to the United Nations.;We have asked the Security Council. As you know, we agreed with the Secretary General 19 when he wanted to go out as Secretary General and go to Hanoi and they didn't receive him. We agreed with him when he wanted them to come to the United Nations after the Gulf of Tonkin. They didn't want to come.;19 U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations.;We felt, after we had explored with all the other 115 nations, that we ought to ask the Security Council to give its consideration and attention to it and we have done that. I have tried, really, to take every position that someone suggested and analyze it, and in good faith explore it and try to run it out to its end, whether it was a pause or whether it was an economic venture or whether it was a United Nations question, or whether it was a nonaligned proposal, or whether it was a reconvening of the Geneva Conference, or whether it was the ICC, 20 or whether it was a 20- or 30-day pause. I think I have taken every single suggestion that anyone has made that seemed to offer any possibility and carried it out. I welcome any other suggestions that any of you may have.;20 International Control Commission, established by the Geneva Accords of 1954 which terminated the war in Indochina between the French and Communist forces.;STRENGTH OF MILITARY FORCES;[14.] Q. Mr. President, do you think that it will require substantially greater numbers of men to pursue this conflict and, if so, how will they be gotten? Are there any plans to call up Reserve units, or anything like that?;THE PRESIDENT. We have no present plans to do that. There will be additional men needed and they will be supplied as General Westmoreland is able to use them and as he may require them. His requests will always be carefully considered and promptly acted upon here. That is what we have done and that is what we are doing.;As you know, he has a problem of fitting them in and providing for necessary installations to take care of them, things of that nature. If your hopes were all realized and we had peace in the area, he wouldn't need any additional troops. But I don't see that at the moment. There will be additional ones. As he requests them, they will be supplied, as I have stated on several occasions.;Q. Sir, are you in a position to give any figures?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Q. Are you able to judge, tell us, Mr. President, whether that will involve Reserves or any approval by Congress?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't want to predict because you all are very critical of Mr. McNamara 21 when he makes predictions. I see at this moment no requirement for the Reserves, but I wouldn't want to say that firmly. I don't want to guess. At the moment we don't have any plans for that.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.;21 Robert S. McNamara, Secretary of Defense.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks Upon Signing the "Cold War GI Bill" (Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966).</td><td class="c6">March 3, 1966</td><td class="c7">Members of the Cabinet, distinguished Members of the Congress, invited guests, ladies and gentlemen;During World War II when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the first Veterans' Readjustment Act, he stated on the occasion of that signing, "This law gives emphatic notice to the men and women of our Armed Forces that the American people never intend to let them down.;That first GI bill, and later the Korean GI bill, brought, out of the hardship of war, hope for all of our American service people. They returned home to find not just gratitude, but concrete help in getting a fresh start: with educational assistance, with medical care, with guarantees that permitted them to buy homes to live in.;They found opportunity which they used to enrich themselves and to enrich the Nation.;As we meet here today in this historic East Room and look around and see our friends gathered, we see the results of that first legislation.;One hundred and sixteen Members of the House of Representatives, in our Congress, received training under the GI bills, as did 11 United States Senators, 12 of the Governors of our States, 3 members of the President's Cabinet, 1 Justice of the Supreme Court, 6 of our astronauts, and 5 of the President's Special Assistants here in the White House.;The first two GI bills cost $21 billion. Our economists now estimate that they resulted in a return of some $60 billion in Federal taxes for that $21 billion invested.;The educational level of World War II and Korean war veterans averages about 2 years above the level of nonveterans. This difference exists primarily because of what the GI bills were able to do.;We made the most promising investment that a nation can make, an investment in the talent and the ambition of our citizens. The return on that investment has doubled and has redoubled ever since.;Today we come here in a time of new testing. Today, by signing a new Veterans' Readjustment Act--that was authored in the Senate by my colleague and friend of many years, Senator Yarborough, and reported in the House by Chairman Teague, with the unanimous support of his committee--we are reaffirming President Roosevelt's pledge of 22 years ago. We are saying to the brave Americans who serve us in uniform, in camps and bases, in villages and jungles, that your country is behind you, that we support you, that you serve us in time of danger.;To say this does not mean that all Americans agree on everything that is done or on every policy or on every commitment. But it does mean that once that policy is established, once that commitment is made, once that pledge is given, we support fully the young men who are the spearhead of that policy.;The Congress has passed this legislation. It passed it without a single dissenting vote. In doing so, it said: We will support these men who are defending our freedom to debate, who are joining in a most historic protest for their country--a protest against tyranny, a protest against aggression, and a protest against misery.;The budget I sent to Congress this year resulted from a very careful study of the Nation's resources. My Cabinet officers brought to my home in Texas, where I was recuperating from an operation, budget requests that they had gone over very carefully that amounted to $130 billion. They felt that they could not reduce beyond this amount. It was my sad duty to bring those requests in line with what I thought our resources were and what I thought the Congress would approve. And we got them down to a little under $113 billion.;Of that $113 billion, over $10 billion-$10.2 billion to be exact--will go this year to education and training. When I became President in fiscal year 1964, we were spending $4,750 million. Although I have been in the Presidency but a little over 2 years, we have more than doubled the amount that we are spending for education and training-from $4.75 billion to $10.2 billion-from fiscal 1964 to fiscal 1967.;Education gets more money in this budget than any other items except interest on the public debt, some $12 billion, and the Defense Department, which, as you know, exceeds $50 billion.;Well, I must be frank. I had felt that we could start the new GI program, and that we should, by providing special funds for soldiers who served in combat areas. Others could be provided opportunity grants through the Higher Education Act. In that way, I was hopeful that we would not ask for more than we could get, or bite off more than we could chew in educational costs.;The Congress considered these measures, and in their judgment, as I say, passed this by a unanimous vote. They felt that we should go far in excess of what I asked for this year. The bill before me this morning exceeds my budget request by more than $245 million for fiscal year 1967, and by more than $1,800 million over the next 5 years.;Because it is for education, I am going to sign this bill, even though it provides hundreds of millions of dollars more than I thought it advisable to recommend or to ask for this year.;This is the first major measure enacted in this session of Congress, and a President just must not ignore the unanimous vote of both Houses of the Congress, the two Texas chairmen, Yarborough and Teague, and some 5 million men who will be the beneficiaries who have worn the uniform.;I want to call attention, however, and make a most solemn warning about future legislation. Unless we can balance our requests with prudence, and our concern with caution, then we are likely to get our figures back to that $130 billion that came over from the departments.;I am going to sign this measure this morning notwithstanding the fact that it goes further than I was willing to ask for this year, because, paraphrasing what Secretary Rusk said the other day in response to a question from Congress, he said, "Well, Senator, could it be that they could perhaps be wrong?" And it just could be that the President was wrong when he made his original request.;I supported this legislation when I was a Member of the Senate, and sometimes you look at things a little differently from one end of the Avenue than you do from the other.;I have tried to take into consideration all of the factors that should be weighed. I have heard the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and every commander--General Walt this week, General Westmoreland a couple of weeks ago--tell me about the dedication of our fighting men. I am convinced that these brave Americans who serve us on many fronts today, particularly in Vietnam and the Dominican Republic, and others, are the very best men that our country has ever produced. They are great soldiers.;I am going to resolve this doubt in behalf of the Congress, which has spent more hours considering this than I have, and sign this legislation in the hope that when the peace is won, we can provide the means of making great civilians in time of peace out of these great soldiers who served us in time of need.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at the Graduation Ceremony of the Capitol Page School.</td><td class="c6">June 14, 1966</td><td class="c7">Mr. Vice President, graduates of the Capitol Page School, your parents, Members of Congress;I want to welcome you here this morning to the Rose Garden at the White House because I am very proud to speak to you as a fellow alumnus of Capitol Hill.;You have reason to be proud too, I think, for you have been a part of what we think is the most productive session of Congress in the history of the Republic. You have seen men rise to great challenges, master them, and move on to greater ones.;You have helped to create the fruits of that leadership--the laws that will make it possible for our people to achieve a better way of life.;The landmark legislation that's passed by this Congress will in time, in my judgment, change the face of this entire Nation.;So I want, this morning, to thank you for your part in that effort, and I also want to congratulate you as a graduate.;This is a very good time, I think, to be a young man. More roads are opening every day to more opportunities for more young Americans than at any time in the history of this country. What counts is how you choose those opportunities.;For you, identity is measured by what you choose to do--by the worth of what you achieve.;Even before I came to Washington as a young man, I noticed how many men said what had to be done could not be done. But, as I learned in the Congress, every step that needs to be taken can be taken by men who are determined to join hands and journey forward together.;There is another lesson I learned in Congress-the need for leaders in every branch of public and private life to work together, for parties to seek common objectives.;We have had an excellent example of that here in the White House just in the last few days. I asked the leaders of Congress of both parties to come and talk to Secretary Rusk after his return from the NATO Conference in Brussels, to talk about Vietnam, to talk about the Dominican Republic, and to talk about other important foreign policy matters.;I did not ask them as Democrats or as Republicans. They came here as Americans and as my partners in this Government of the United States of America. I wanted them to have the latest and the fullest and the most complete information that we had in the executive department, because I needed their frank and their informed and their helpful judgments. I received it. I am grateful for it.;I have no doubt that the congressional leadership took away as much confidence and understanding and hope as they left behind. And that is really what leadership means--but it is not all of it.;The White House and the Congress can give only a part of the leadership this Nation requires and demands. The rest is up to its citizens, to the people who make up the 200 million Americans that inhabit our shores. The rest is up to the young and to the old among us.;So this morning I congratulate you and I challenge you and I ask each of you for a commitment to leadership. You could be the leaders, for instance, in education.;Today most of our children are untouched by education until they are at least 6 years old. But we know that the child's mind is wide open as early as 4. In the formative years we now largely ignore it. You can take the lead in remedying that.;You could commit yourself to finding new ways to teach the very young, to train them earlier so that they would be better prepared to enter high school and college, and to enter it earlier--to equip them earlier with the discipline and the purpose that would bring them fulfillment in life sooner.;You could be the leaders in answering other educational questions. If 16 years of elementary and secondary and college education were good enough for present generations, are they going to be good enough for your generation? Should we not keep pace with the knowledge explosion and aim perhaps to give every child an extra 2 years of schooling?;Well, that is an answer we need. That is a challenge we present. And there are countless others your generation must meet and solve. I would welcome discussing them this morning, if you had the time and I had the time.;You are young now, but what will your old age be? Now is the time to think about that, to lead in doing something about it. It takes time, you know--we spent 20 years getting medical care. And from the time you start a program, until you get it inaugurated, a good deal of time elapses.;How could we add 10 more meaningful years to our life? Living longer is not the answer. Greater leisure is not the answer. How to live more completely, or more purposefully, or more productively, how to lengthen real happiness and real fulfillment?;Well, these are the answers we seek. Our older people need new training, and they need new opportunities for not just a longer, but a longer and a much larger life.;We in Government are working on these problems of the very old. And we are certainly concerned with the problems of the very young--much more so now, I think, than we were a few years ago. We are now using the best brains outside of Government to help us master them, and I ask you to join us.;In a few days I am going to write a letter to the Secretary of HEW asking him to set up a very special group to make a very special study about what we can do in the twilight period of peoples' lives in this country-and to come in with strong recommendations that we can evaluate and consider. 1;1 The proposals of Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare John W. Gardner on increasing social security benefits are summarized in the President's remarks at the Social Security Administration headquarters in Baltimore on October 12, 1966 (see Item 509).;And I want to ask you to join the best brains in helping us formulate some of these programs. I want each of you to walk out in the world determined--determined to move it, to contribute to it, and to shape it-to be leaders and not followers.;Now that is the commitment that carried me into public life as a very young man. I did not announce when I came here 35 years ago that I was going to roll up my sleeves and remake America, because I had read Rex Tugwell's announcement, and I saw that he telegraphed his shots. He didn't quite succeed all at the same time, although I had the same ideas and the same ambitions.;So you may not telegraph all you plan to do. You may not announce all you plan to do. But I do hope that you have the hope and the idea and the plan to roll up your sleeves and do something about improving conditions in this country and leaving this land a better place than you found it.;I feel that is the commitment that is responsible for me standing here as your President today. And I think one of you could, and very likely will, stand in this same place some day. Someone said to me the other night after seeing the television show I appeared in, "The President's Country"--and my part of this land: "You know, I had always heard all my life that any boy born in America had a chance to grow up and be President and now I believe it.;So I would remind each of you that any boy born in America has a chance to grow up and be President. It may happen to you. I hope if it should happen to you that you will be prepared for it.;Count it a day lost when the people of America can't go to sleep at night without knowing the world is a better place at bedtime than it was at breakfast.;The opportunity is here. Your parents have provided you with tools, ammunition, and implements that are given to no other people of your age in the world. You have more food, more clothes, better per capita income, better housing, more luxury, more recreation, better trained teachers, better schools than your young folks of any other area in the world.;I know that you have taken advantage of it or you would not be here graduating this morning. But I hope in the days ahead you will feel that you have a personal challenge and a personal responsibility to pick up where you are this morning and develop this land--not just by enduring the status quo that you have found, but by improving it, by remaking it, by developing it into a fuller and richer life, not only for all of our older people, but for all of our younger ones that may follow you.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks to the Delegates to a Conference of State Legislative Leaders.</td><td class="c6">June 16, 1966</td><td class="c7">Governor Bryant and distinguished legislators;I hope all of you have seated yourselves, I think it is asking enough of you to sit out in this sun without asking you to stand and listen to a speech. We would have you in the East Room except for the fact that some of our million-odd visitors happen to be going through there at this time of day and we do not want to cut them off because we might get a resolution in that connection if we did !;I am very grateful to you for coming here to Washington to participate in this conference in the Nation's Capital. The role of a legislator is one that is very familiar to me. I grew up in that tradition. My father was elected to the Texas Legislature 4 years before I discovered America. And he completed his service there in the early twenties. So I had some understanding of the problems of a legislator during my formative years.;Automobiles, at that time, were a novelty in our country. And I remember how my father traveled back and forth to Austin in a horse and buggy. And I think that we could truly say that during that period it was really horse and buggy government.;But we had our problems and our challenges. They were anti-prohibition and anti-Klan and anti-women suffrage and all those things in those days. They have changed some now, and the 20th century and the problems of 1966 are somewhat different.;But having been in the legislative atmosphere in Washington for 35 years, with the background that I have, I think you can understand why I am anxious to have you come here. Because I think we are entering a new era of relations between the State and the Federal Government. I think we are going to prove that federalism, America's unique contribution to political science, will be equal to the challenges that face us in the 20th century.;There are some who say that the State governments have become obsolete, that they have failed to meet their challenge. But if we admit such failure we admit that the American system has failed. And I think that you know and I know that that is not true.;So, if we come here together and reason together, and exchange viewpoints and accept facts, and draw conclusions and make recommendations, we can prove, I think, that Federal, State, and local governments can join together shoulder to shoulder to insure all the social and economic development which our age demands.;Now that is not an easy task. And I realize that the domestic approaches are not always at that moment as enthusiastically received by the States, by the counties, by the cities, by the homefolks, as they are when they are presented.;Yesterday I talked to a group about medical care. And if I had made the observations 20 years ago about medical care that I made yesterday, I would have been driven out of the Capitol. It has taken a good long period of time for our people, all of them, to see and accept that development. So has it taken them a good long time to really see and accept and embrace the Bill of Rights. It took us a good period of time to see them formulated, and to see them guaranteed, and to see them preserved.;As a matter of fact, the court works on them every day to see that they are not chipped away. I do not have time to go into it with you in detail this morning, but I would hope that this Government in this time, in our time, would be remembered for its own particular Bill of Rights. I think that a citizen of America--black or white or brown, Catholic or Jew or Baptist or Protestant, any kind, north or south, east or west, farmer or cab driver--I think that he ought to have the right to be free, and to break it down in some detail, I would say that is the right to vote--unchallenged, unintimidated, unblackmailed, unhandcuffed.;He ought to have that right. He ought to have the right to eat in any public cafe. He ought to have the right to sleep where the public is welcome. He shouldn't have to drive night after night to try to find a bed, because his religion is such or his color is such that he cannot be accepted because of the peculiarities of someone who holds him out--themselves out to serve the public. So I think he ought to have a right to be free.;I think every child born in this country ought to have a right to all the education he can take. Now we are debating whether it should start at 4 years old or 6 years old, or whatever age. That is a detail we can work out. But I do believe that we, in our time, can and have and must do something about the right of every child to get all the education he can take.;I am not interested in the image or the appearance of it. I am interested in the accomplishment and the achievement. I am interested in the results we obtain.;Now, what are we doing in that field? We passed the Elementary School Act. It was pretty difficult getting it passed. I have been around here for 30 years hearing people talk about Federal aid to schools. And it has been generally opposed by very vociferous people.;The Jewish organizations--I went out and made a speech to B'nai B'rith, and the next morning they resolved against my elementary school bill. I was like the lawyer who said he made the greatest speech that he ever made in his lifetime before the jury. He was asked, "What did they do to your client?" And he said, "They hung him.;I thought at one time that I had the Catholics where they would go along with the school bill, only to find that the subcommittee didn't think so at all. And just about the time I had it all put together, one of my Baptist friends called up and said that he wanted me to know that he thought the Pope had taken over Washington and they couldn't go along with that bill, either.;One of my secretaries told him that I couldn't talk then. He said, "Why?" She said, "He is out talking to Dr. Graham--he is swimming with Dr. Graham." He said, "You don't mean he is swimming in the middle of the day--the President?" She said, "Yes, he is out swimming before lunch." He said, "Who did you say he was swimming with?" She said, "Dr. Graham." He said, "Our Billy?" And I think the fact that Dr. Graham was here--"our Billy" was here at that time--kind of helped us to put those factions together.;But, the fact that the B'nai B'rith and the Catholic organizations on welfare and Dr. Graham and the Baptists and others finally agreed on the elementary school bill--it had never been done before--we have over a billion dollars this year going down on the basis of needs to children.;We have a vocational education bill. We have a higher education bill. For the first time in the history of America, a poor child that has the qualifications, who has completed the prescribed course of study--that child can either get a job to go to college, can get a loan to go to college, or can get a scholarship to go to college. Now that has never existed before, so I think we ought to have a right to all the education we can take.;The right to good health in this country, I think is another right that this Government-Democrats and Republicans, independents and progressives, reactionaries and conservatives, and liberals and radicals-all of them ought to join together in the right to good health. And we are trying to do everything we can about it.;We have roughly 18 million people who are going to have hospital treatment available to them, medical treatment available to them, nursing home treatment available to them, medicines available to them. Most of you are not 65. But I imagine most of you have an uncle or an aunt or a grandma who is 65. And you must know what a relief it is for them to have the feeling that without bothering their son-in-law or brother-in-law they can go in, not as a charity patient, or not because some mayor has called up and said, "We will let them occupy a bed down here that the city will pay for." But they can go in with their card and have hospital care and nursing care and medical care.;Now, we have a billion dollars that we are spending on medical research so that the time will come when our life expectancy will not be 70 years, but will be materially increased. I have spent the morning talking to some very exciting people: Ambassador Porter, who is just here from Vietnam (he is the principal deputy to Ambassador Lodge--he is in charge of our civil program out there) and Mr. Robert Komer, who is a top man on my Security Council staff in charge of Vietnam matters.;We have two phases of the war out there. I am going to let you in on a secret. You have heard just about the military phase, this other has been kept under wraps. We do not know much about it, because Captain Carpenter giving an order to come in to bomb his position is much more dramatic than some fellow that is washing up the kids, and treating their wounds, and teaching them to read and write--a Marine who has fought all day, that is working all night to help in these things.;But we are doing a great job there on health. And what we are doing on education, and on health, and on conservation, and on beautification, and on housing, and on slums in this country is contagious. And it is moving to other countries. It is setting an example for other countries.;In Vietnam today the average citizen dies at 35--at the age of 35! Now because of what we have done--all these domestic programs that a lot of people don't approve of when they start, and they got a lot of holes, you can run a wagon through them sometimes, until you get them perfected. So did the veteran's pension. So did the bonus. So did social security. So did agriculture conservation. So did REA. I remember the great weaknesses we had in that program the first year. But who would repeal REA and social security and school lunch and those things now?;So we are trying to put some of those things in--not just in this country but in other countries. We have distributed 11 million schoolbooks to the children of Vietnam, in this nation of 14 million, already. We have doubled their rice production. We are going to materially increase their life expectancy. And when Uncle Sam leaves that country--and it can't be too soon to suit us--we hope that we can provide all the help they need until they are able to take over themselves. Then that we can come back home just as we have on every other effort that we have made in that direction, and let them carry on and develop. But one thing you can be sure of: We are going to make a material contribution to their education, to their production, to their way of life, to their health, to increasing their life expectancy.;So these rights--the right to be free, the right to receive all the education you can take, the right to good health, the right to enjoy the fruits of conservation and scenic beauty, as you are seeing here in the first house of the land, but I would like to see in every city and county and courtyard and city hall and State yard in this Capital--all of those things are making progress in this country and I think are spilling over into other nations.;Why? Because an essential, basic part of our defense of this country is to serve notice on all the people who live in this world with us that gangsterism and aggression and force are not to be rewarded.;Now we were hesitant to do that in World War II when Hitler went through Poland. We thought we could sit that one out. We had a lot of the fathers of that time who said it was not our concern. They carried umbrellas around saying that we had been to Europe to save democracy in World War I, and that we shouldn't get involved in World War II.;But we find that when an aggressor is on the march, when a conqueror is out to subjugate, that he doesn't just eliminate the most desirable. We have what other people want. And if they develop the strength and the power to take it, don't you think they won't! So, in due time, almost too late-when I think of some of the problems I have now, I am rather thankful they are not any more than they are because I remember in August before Pearl Harbor in December, that President Roosevelt had a Congress that voted 203 to 202 to extend the draft--by only one vote. And I think what the consequences would have been if we had sent the Army home!;But we had men in the Senate at that time, that were on the Foreign Relations Committee, who said they had better information than the President. Thank goodness the President had that one-vote margin! And I am not sure that some higher force didn't contribute to it. Because I thought I had been elected to the Senate in July of that year, but they counted down there about a week and I was finally defeated for the Senate 1,311 votes. I had to return to my House seat. And I was there to cast I of those 203 votes that did not send the Army home.;So when you come in here today in this period of time when we are trying to guarantee not only our Bill of Rights but our rights to good health, our rights to education, our rights to be free, our rights to enjoy ourselves and raise our families in good environments, and our rights to liberty and freedom--it means we cannot have those rights unless we try to help other people preserve them, too.;So we say to any other would-be conqueror: When and if you attempt by force to subjugate people, you will meet the United States of America.;President Eisenhower and Secretary Dulles presented to the Congress a commitment of that kind and the Congress entered into it 82 to 1.;And we were called upon to perform on that commitment when aggression started. We are now doing our best to provide the maximum amount of deterrence with the minimum amount of loss.;We have lost over 2,000 men who have died in battle in Vietnam this year--2,000. We lost 50,000 on our highways last year. But would that we had not lost any!;But we cannot tell what the days ahead hold for us. We know they are going to be difficult. We know they are going to require sacrifice. Everything we have ever done in our history to preserve freedom has required it. But we are going to continue on, to carry out our military effort to prevent that deterrent--and our civil effort to educate and to improve the health and to give the training and to increase the production on the civil side of the people in that country.;And I am very grateful--I didn't know you had a resolution considered. I get a good many resolutions and it is always heartening when I get one like this. I hear a lot about petitions these days. That is a right that we all enjoy and that we freely exercise.;But I am delighted that as a result of your judgments and your deliberations and your experiences, that you would feel that you would want to pass a resolution such as I had read to me.;Secretary Rusk has just returned from a NATO conference in Brussels. We regret very much that General de Gaulle has felt it necessary to express himself as he has. We have accepted what he has said more in sorrow than in anger. And we, and our other allies in NATO--the 14--have met and have reached judgments which are in the process of being executed.;We hope in due time that events will prove that those judgments are wise. We believe in collective security and we are going to make whatever contribution to it we can. We are doing the same thing in Southeast Asia.;We have met with the Prime Minister of India and with the President of Pakistan. And we think we have made a contribution to trying to bring about better understanding in that part of the world.;We have just completed a year of trial in the Dominican Republic. Under a provisional government, we have said to all the would-be conquerors that you cannot, by force, come in and set up governments and enslave people. We will provide the assistance that is necessary through the Organization of American States in cooperation with our neighbors in this hemisphere to make this hemisphere safe from would-be conquerors, and allow the people, themselves, to select their own type of government. And in a free election, with numerous observers from all factions, by a majority in excess of over 200,000, a President has been chosen, and will be installed.;So the hemisphere is making progress. Two and a half years ago our per capita growth was 1 percent in this hemisphere. It is now in excess of 2 1/2.;I had a group of African diplomats in last week. We are very concerned with their problems. We are doing what we can to help those newly born nations achieve not only the independence that they have so long sought and desired, but during this growing period to help them by more material means establish stability. So when you look at Europe, when you look at Africa, when you look at Asia, we have a great deal to be thankful for.;We are moving ahead. We are making progress. Our Nation can be proud of what it is doing there as well as what it is doing here. In no period of our national history have we made more progress in the field of education and health and conservation than we have made in the sixties. And in all of that effort we welcome your cooperation and we welcome your support--and we think as a result of your meeting here that good things will flow from it.;I propose to submit to the Congress this next session--I have 90 measures I have submitted this time, I have only had 60 of them acted upon by the House committee. I met with their chairman yesterday. So I do not think I will submit much more this session--may have one or two extra things. But, next year I am going to submit to Congress legislation for a management exchange program that will allow Federal officials to work out arrangements with State and local governments and to give State and local officials a chance to work at the Federal level.;We have done some of this by mutual exchange. But I hope to have legislation that will underwrite a program where we can bring all phases of our Government closer together.;I think the States will have to adopt appropriate arrangements, and I hope they will want to. We are considering, and I solicit your suggestion, ways in which the Government can help States and cities in their training programs of junior officials.;I have already asked the Director of the Budget to report to me before the start of the next Congress on how we can lend Federal support to programs for training State and local executives. I find that one of the best sources of the employees for the Federal Government are men who have been trained at the State level. And I thank you for producing those men and for making them available to us in our military and in our civilian effort.;Governor Bryant has a specific injunction and responsibility to not only maintain contact with each of the Governors of the 50 States and the Territories, but also to maintain contact with the legislative leaders of both parties in those States.;We make mistakes, and we know it and we regret them. We wish we could avoid making them. Perhaps if we can hear from you soon enough you can correct them before they develop into very serious matters. So, in the spirit of give and take I want you to know that we are grateful for your coming here.;I need all the help I can get. I am doing my deadlevel best to provide this country and our people with as good a government as I am capable of. I am doing the best I can. But I can do better--if the Governors of the States, if the responsible legislative leaders of that State, will come in and tell me of things that we can do, and emphasize those things more than if they just tell others about things that we should not have done.;No man in public life--and certainly not one who has reached the stage that I am in now--ever ran on a platform of doing what was wrong. We all think that we are doing right. But our problem is not to do what is right. Our problem is to know what is right.;And when you have to look at this problem of 120 nations with their diverse populations and their backgrounds, and their environments and their geography, and their views and their ancient hatreds and their traditions, when you have 50 States--and I can assure you that the people of Maine and the people of Mississippi don't always see everything alike--then you must make the decision (as President Truman said, "The buck stops here") on what is in the national interest, what is the greatest good for the greatest number.;Now Mr. Rayburn used to have a favorite saying that any donkey could kick a barn down, but it took a good carpenter to build one.;Yesterday I met with the doctors. The day before I met with the bankers. Today I am meeting with the legislators. Tomorrow I will meet with the labor people. The next day I will meet with the committee chairmen.;Over the weekend I met with the legislative leaders of both parties who felt the need of more meetings and who commented on our candor. And I told them everything that I knew--all in the hope that we can not only do what is right but we can do what is right by knowing what is right. So please feel that you are honored by your people--to help your country have the best government that it can possibly have at every level. And I am trying to do that without regard to party, without regard to prejudice, and without regard to the passions of the moment.;Men in this Government are selected on the basis of merit. They are given responsibility and they are supported. If they make mistakes, I try to correct them. And we make plenty. But I think that we can do a better job if all of you will come in here and help us "build this barn.;I am trying, with everything I have got, to build the best barn I can--to put in this goldfish bowl that is called America the best example that we can of what is good, and what is fair, and what is just, and what is right, and something that every other nation would like to emulate.;And we are charged with many motivations. I said to a friend of mine the other night in New York--he'd asked me this question why we would be out 10,000 miles fighting for 14 million people so they could be free and have liberty.;And I said: "We are not just fighting for 14 million. We are fighting for almost 3 billion people who also want freedom and liberty. I know another nation that you are interested in has a few hundred thousand population, and they are not going to be able to stand up to conquerors with their little limited forces if we throw in the towel, and move out of the way of the advancing fide, and come running home, or surrender, or pull in our horns, or send up the white flag. We are fighting for a hundred nations' freedom and liberty, and we are going to continue to fight until men are convinced that it is better to talk than to fight.;We have been convinced of that a long time. We are ready to do that any time, anywhere, with any government. And all they have to do to test us is to name the place and the date, and they will find us there. But until the other side sees the same thing you cannot have a unilateral contract.;The strength that you have given your President and your country by your resolution is appreciated. And I would like to tell each of you that personally. If you will get out of that sun and come in the shade, and walk through the office, I will show you where I spend a good many hours every day. Again thank you personally.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">June 18, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. I have some announcements and appointments, and some statements that I will review with you. The Press Office will have copies of these announcements available as soon after the meeting as possible. When I conclude, I will be glad to attempt to answer any questions that you may have.;HOUSING FOR THE POOR;[1.] Fifteen months ago, I urged the Congress to adopt a new concept in housing for our poor. 1 I urged a program to make it economically possible for private enterprise for the first time to take a direct hand in meeting the housing needs of 7 million American families that are living now in substandard dwellings.;1 See 1965 volume, this series, Book I, Item 90 (P. 237).;Last year the Congress enacted the rent supplement program into law. Last month it appropriated the money to put that program into action. 2;2 The rent supplement program was enacted as part of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 (Public Law 89-117, 79 Stat. 451). Legislation appropriating funds for the program was approved by the President on May 13, 1966, and September 6, 1966 (see Items 223, 439).;Today we are ready to begin assigning the funds to the first projects. Secretary Weaver has set aside over $600,000 to provide for more than 1,000 units of modest but decent housing.;These projects are located in Boston, in Cleveland, in the Delta area of Mississippi, in New Orleans, in New York, in Omaha, in Pasco, Washington, in Philadelphia, in Providence, in Saginaw, Michigan, in San Antonio, and in the Watts area of Los Angeles.;The project in Providence climaxes a dream begun nearly a century ago. In 1883 a Dr. Chase Wiggins set up a trust to found the Building, Sanitary and Educational Association to build housing for the laboring classes. He stipulated, however, that the money could not be used until the trust reached $500,000.;That event has coincided with the inauguration of the rent supplement pro, gram--and the association will now sponsor its first housing.;In Omaha, Nebraska, an association for the blind was formed in 1946. Through contributions made to its White Cane Drive, it accumulated enough money to buy some land. Now, with the rent supplements, it can build on that land low cost housing for blind people with low incomes.;These examples are just a beginning. They should be a spur to further action.;All that remains is for the Senate to approve the regular appropriation bill to carry this program forward. Today I urge them once again to do so. This promise to our poor must be fulfilled and I believe it will be.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC;NOMINATION OF JOHN HUGH CRIMMINS AS;AMBASSADOR;[2.] I want to announce that I intend to nominate John Hugh Crimmins of Maryland as United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. He will succeed W. Tapley Bennett, who has been assigned as Ambassador to Portugal.;Secretary Rusk, Assistant Secretary Gordon--he's Assistant Secretary for Latin America--and Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker 3 each recommend Mr. Crimmins for this important post.;3 Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, Lincoln Gordon, Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs and U.S. Coordinator, Alliance for Progress, and Ellsworth Bunker, U.S. Representative to the Council of the Organization of American States.;Mr. Crimmins is one of our outstanding career Foreign Service officers. He has had wide experience in Latin American affairs, particularly in the Caribbean area and in the economic field.;His recent assignments include duty in our Embassy in Rio de Janeiro. From late 1961 to February 1963 he served as Director of the Office of Caribbean and Mexican Affairs and then as Coordinator of Cuban Affairs until 1965.;Since January, Mr. Crimmins has served with distinction as Deputy Chief of Mission and Charge d'Affaires in Santo Domingo. He is proficient in Spanish and Portuguese. His demonstrated competence, experience, and language ability make him very well qualified for this special assignment.;This appointment continues our policy of rewarding those in our career service who have demonstrated their merit and their capacity to handle posts of the highest responsibility.;U.S. REPRESENTATION AT INAUGURATION;[3.] We have received a note from the Provisional Government of the Dominican Republic inviting the United States to send a special mission to the inauguration of President-elect Joaquin Balaguer on July 1. I have asked Vice President Humphrey to represent the United States on this important occasion--as it was my privilege to do at the inauguration of President Bosch 4 in 1963.;4 Juan Bosch, former President of the Dominican Republic.;He will carry the best wishes of this country to the President-elect and the Dominican nation as they resume constitutional government and launch a new effort to seek economic prosperity and social justice under the Alliance for Progress.;The Dominican Republic deserves the salute of us all for the free and fair elections and the massive participation of the Dominican people in them.;The victory belongs to the Dominican people for making the electoral process an effective instrument for expressing their will. But it belongs also to the leaders of the Dominican Republic--to Provisional President Garcia-Godoy, Dr. Balaguer, Professor Bosch, Dr. Bonnelly 5 --for their leadership and their high sense of responsibility.;5 Rafael Bonnelly, former President of the Dominican Republic.;The Organization of American States can take great satisfaction over its helpful contribution. For the victory of the Dominican people is shared by all the peoples of this hemisphere.;The Dominican Government and the people know that they can count on the continued support of the Organization of American States. The United States, for its part, stands ready to cooperate in mutual efforts under the Alliance for Progress to advance the economic and social well-being of the Dominican people.;TRIBUTE TO AMBASSADOR ELLSWORTH BUNKER;[4.] Finally, I wish to say a few words about Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. He belongs not only to the United States but to the hemisphere. He has rendered great service to both.;Wise in the ways of statecraft, unvacillating in his faith in the democratic process, tenacious in the pursuit of fair solutions, firm and patient in the face of adversity, respected by all for his integrity and impartiality-he has brought high honor to himself and his country and the Organization of American States which he represented.;OTHER PRESIDENTIAL APPOINTMENTS AND;NOMINATIONS;[5.] I have spent some time yesterday and today and preceding days on appointments. I am delighted to announce today that I expect to nominate for reappointment Gerald F. Tape of New York to be a member of the Atomic Energy Commission for a term of 5 years, expiring June 30, 1971.;I expect to nominate Dr. Samuel M. Nabrit, president of Texas Southern University, as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to succeed Mrs. Mary I. Bunting, for a term expiring June 30, 1970.;I expect to reappoint Rosel H. Hyde as a member of the Federal Communications Commission and to designate him as Commission Chairman. He is now a Republican appointee to that Commission.;I also intend to nominate Nicholas Johnson, present Federal Maritime Administrator, to fill the existing vacancy on the Federal Communications Commission created by the resignation of E. William Henry.;I intend to nominate Winthrop Knowlton to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs to replace Merlyn Trued, who has recently resigned.;I have today accepted with regret the resignation of Adm. William F. Raborn as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.;To replace Admiral Raborn, I am naming Richard McGarrah Helms, who is currently serving as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.;I also intend to appoint Mr. Henry D. Owen as the new Chairman of the Policy Planning Council replacing Mr. Rostow. Mr. Owen is currently Acting Chairman of the Policy Planning Council at the State Department.;U.S. REPRESENTATION AT GUATEMALAN;INAUGURATION;[6.] I have asked Governor John Connally 6 to head our delegation to the inauguration of President-elect Mendez Montenegro June 28 to July 2.;6 Of Texas.;President-elect Montenegro has been the distinguished dean of the law school at San Carlos University. He leaves the classroom to assume the highest office of his country. The Guatemalan people, in reaffirming their faith in constitutional government through free and peaceful elections, have picked one of their most distinguished educators to guide their destiny for the next 4 years. I have asked Governor Connally and the delegation accompanying him to carry the best wishes of the United States Government and people to the Guatemalan nation for this historic occasion.;STATEMENT ON VIETNAM;[7.] In the past few weeks the battle in Vietnam has become more intense. The large forces infiltrated from the North into South Vietnam in recent months are now being engaged--sometimes at their initiative, sometime at ours. The forces of South Vietnam, the United States, and our allies have responded with skill, courage, and effectiveness.;During this period my advisers and I have--almost on a daily basis--continued closely to examine and to scrutinize what the aggressor has been doing and our own course of action.;We have examined the alternatives open to us--including all suggestions from those who have not shared our views.;In the light of the full information available to the President of the United States, we sincerely feel that the national interest requires that we persist in our present policy. That policy is to bring to bear the ground, naval, and air strength required to achieve our objective.;I must observe that this does not mean that we shall not increase our forces or our operations. It is not good national policy publicly to declare to those conducting aggression that there are particular limits on how we shall act to defeat that aggression.;But our objectives remain what they have been;--to guarantee that infiltration, subversion, and terror mounted and infiltrated from North Vietnam cannot swallow or conquer South Vietnam;--to permit the people of South Vietnam to select their own government and to build a way of life which conforms to their own traditions and desires.;In meeting this objective, we must also reassure the world that America's agreements, once they are made, are not broken.;We are not fighting to remain in South Vietnam, not to hold bases there, not to control the affairs of that people.;We are there to defeat aggression, to permit a young nation to develop its own destiny, to help its people rebuild and create a modern nation even before the guns go silent.;But to these limited objectives we are fully committed.;What are our prospects?;I must frankly tell you that our intelligence indicates that the aggressor presently bases his hopes, we think, more on political differences in Saigon and Washington than on his military capacity in South Vietnam. While we have differences and divisions, I want our men in the field and our people at home to know that our course is resolute, that our conviction is firm, and we shall not be diverted from doing what is necessary in the Nation's interest and the cause of freedom.;By every evidence available to us, the majority of the people of South Vietnam seem determined to fight for the right to work out their own affairs. They want to go forward with economic reform, with greater social justice, and a constitutional government.;They must do this in the midst of a bitter and ugly war. Since January 1, 1966, we have lost 2,200 of our men, the South Vietnamese have lost 4,300 of their men, our allies have lost 250 of their men.;But the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese have lost three times our combined losses. They have lost 22,500 of their men.;Our attacks on military targets in North Vietnam have imposed a growing burden on those who support the insurgency in the South. We must continue to raise the cost of aggression at its source. And that is the sole purpose of our use of air strength against selected military targets.;In the South, I am encouraged that the Vietnamese are carrying forward the first steps in building a constitutional process. I discussed that at some length this week with Ambassador Porter, who was here in company with Mr. Komer. 7;7 William J. Porter, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam, and Robert W. Komer, Special Assistant to the President for Peaceful Reconstruction in Vietnam.;The rules for electing a constituent assembly on September 11 have now been formulated. We can expect continued ferment even after the elections are held. Rival political forces are contending for power. This is natural and this is inevitable at this point in the political life of a developing nation.;We shall continue to back the Vietnamese effort to achieve government by the consent of the people, even as they fight the war.;Economically, important steps are underway to control inflation. You will see announcements about them on the tickers today-to expand the flow of supplies to the people, to carry forward the Vietnamese program of revolutionary development.;Here in the United States I believe our people are determined to see this through. In recent primaries, not one candidate for Congress was able to make opposition to the resistance of aggression in South Vietnam a successful position. And more than 125 have now been passed upon by their constituencies. A minority of our people are willing to pull out. Another minority are prepared to see us use our total power. The rest of us, while we may debate this or that dimension of policy, are determined that this Nation honor its responsibility, and its commitment, to help Vietnam turn back aggression from the North.;We must go forward as nations and men have always gone forward in dark moments, confident that when they are right they will prevail. I am confident that we shall gain an honorable peace in South Vietnam.;There are, I believe, very few governments among the more than 120 in the world who do not wish to see an honorable peace at the earliest possible moment. To those few I would say this;There is honor for all in making peace. Let the killing stop.;As the Government of Vietnam said in the Declaration of Honolulu, 8 "stop killing your brothers, sisters, their elders and their children --come and work through constitutional democracy to build together... a life of dignity, freedom and peace....;8 See Item 55.;Look about us in Asia.;Look at the vitality, the economic and social progress of the nine Asian and Pacific nations meeting in Korea.;Look at the new resolve in Indonesia to come to grips with their problems of economic and social development.;Look at the new determination of India and Pakistan to work for their people and to live in peace. Look at the new efforts of the people of Asia to come together and work together in peace.;Ask yourselves: What is the wave of the future?;Is it aggression?;Is it for one nation to conquer another?;Or is it for us all to work together as brothers in growing more food, building more schools, providing better health to all of our people?;I genuinely and sincerely believe it is the latter.;I will be glad now to take questions from you for whatever period of time you feel desirable;QUESTIONS;POSSIBILITY OF TAX INCREASE;[8.] Q. Mr. President, there have been some varying forecasts from members of the Cabinet, Secretary Fowler and Secretary Connor, 9 as to the prospects of a tax increase. I am wondering if you could clear the situation up as of now?;9 Henry H. Fowler, Secretary of the Treasury, and John T. Connor, Secretary of Commerce.;THE PRESIDENT. Twenty-five years ago I would have been concerned about what I have seen about the quotations from the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury. But when I read their statements, I seem to detect that they are expressing in response to inquiries made of them their views about what may develop in this particular field.;I don't think any of us are in a position to state at this time, nor do I desire to speculate on what a decision might be. We are watching all the factors that must be considered, primarily the appropriations measures that are being guided through the Congress, the Government budget itself, and our expenditures in Vietnam, as well as the private factors in the economy.;When we have gone further along with our appropriation bills, and when we have seen evidences that we think justify a decision, I will announce one.;I have not interpreted what the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Treasury has said as being a positive statement of policy of this administration, but rather as their personal feelings, and perhaps a speculation.;As for me, I do not care to speculate and am not in a position to do so now, because the interpretation that would be placed on it might bring about some misunderstandings and misapprehensions. I think it is best to just wait until a decision is made--then announce it.;ON BOMBING HANOI;[9.] Q. Mr. President, would you please explain for us why it is wrong for us to bomb the capital in North Vietnam, and who has ordered this theory into the policy?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think I would want to comment on the tactics or strategy at this point.;Q. Don't you think the people would understand better if you did?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have to be guided by my best judgment in the matter. I will have to do that.;STATEMENTS OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS;[10.] Q. Mr. President, on the march from Memphis to Jackson, 10 some of the present leaders of that march have made statements that are considered quite inflammatory and alarming by a lot of people-such as seizing power and burning down courthouses. I wonder what your reaction is to that march?;THE PRESIDENT. I have not seen the statements that you refer to. I will take a look at them.;10 Civil rights march through the State of Mississippi, conducted by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, for the purpose of encouraging Negroes to register to vote. The marchers reached Jackson, Miss., on June 26 and held a rally of 15,000 persons before the State Capitol.;WILLINGNESS OF HANOI TO NEGOTIATE;[11.] Q. Mr. President, there is a Canadian envoy now in Hanoi, and a French envoy is going there presumably to probe the North Vietnamese position on negotiations. Do you see anything in the situation now which would lend any credence to any disposition on the part of North Vietnam to negotiate?;THE PRESIDENT. I have no information that I could make available that would give you any encouragement.;POSSIBILITY OF A MEETING WITH GENERAL;DE GAULLE;[12.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Mansfield, 11 among others, proposes that a meeting between you and President de Gaulle 12 might now be useful. Do you think such a meeting would be useful at this time?;THE PRESIDENT. I would of course be very happy to see General de Gaulle if he felt a visit would be useful. I am not familiar with any suggestion Senator Mansfield has made in that regard.;11 Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, majority leader of the Senate.;12 Gen. Charles de Gaulle, President of France. 13 On December 8, 1966, the President announced that an agreement had been reached between the United States and other member nations of the United Nations Outer Space Committee on a draft treaty to govern space exploration (see Item 643).;General de Gaulle would always be welcome. Our representatives are in constant touch with his government. And we feel no lack of communication.;RUSSIAN INTEREST IN A SPACE TREATY;[13.] Q. Mr. President, would you give us your reaction, sir, to renewed Russian interest in a space treaty, and whether you think that this might lead to other agreements with the Soviet Union?;THE PRESIDENT. I did not hear you.;Q. Could you give us your reaction to this renewed Russian interest in a treaty on space and the moon, and whether you think that might lead to other agreements?;THE PRESIDENT. We welcome any indication from them at any time in matters of this nature. We have made our proposal. We are very hopeful that our proposal and theirs can be carefully considered--and will prove fruitful. 13;13 On December 8, 1966, the President announced that an agreement had been reached between the United States and other member nations of the United Nations Outer Space committee on a draft treaty to govern space exploration (see Item 643).;ADMIRAL RABORN'S RESIGNATION;[14.] Q. Mr. President, would you care to amplify on your brief announcement of Admiral Raborn's resignation? Is it health or other affairs?;THE PRESIDENT. No. Admiral Raborn had retired. I asked him upon the resignation of Mr. McCone to come here to serve for a period that would be agreeable to him, for such time as he might feel that he could do it. I told him at that time that Mr. Helms would be his Deputy Director and I would hope that Mr. Helms could succeed him at the end of his tour of duty.;He considered my request and although he had no desire to return to Washington, he agreed to come and serve for an indefinite period. He has done that, now he desires to return to California.;Mr. Helms is agreeable to accepting responsibilities heretofore administered by Admiral Raborn.;PROBLEMS OF THE PRESIDENCY;[15.] Q. Mr. President, what is the order of priority of your worries these days? Given the urgent demands of Vietnam, how do you fit in the concerns of NATO, civil rights, the congressional elections, and so forth?;THE PRESIDENT. I think they are all problems in the life of a President. He must try to give whatever time is necessary to each problem and to apply the best judgment that he can to it. That I try to do.;I have a great deal of assistance and a great many helpmates. I am very thankful for the quality of my advisers. I have never worked up any priority of worries.;We do have problems and concerns from day to day. But we have so much more to be grateful for and thankful for, and be encouraged about, than we do to worry about.;When I look about the world, I sometimes feel that conditions may be somewhat depressing to us here in the United States. I look at the problems of other leaders--I don't know of a single one whose situation I would trade for ours. I know of none that is not confronted with somewhat the same types of problems and the same types of worries and sometimes much more aggravating and much more serious than mine have been up to now.;PUBLIC OPINION POLLS;[ 16.] Q. Do the polls worry you?;THE PRESIDENT. No. We always would like to see what we do and what we say approved by our associates and by our constituency-but that is not always the case. When it is not, we regret it and take due notice of it and engage in proper introspection.;But polls vary from week to week and month to month. Those are things that we do not ignore, but they are not one of my burdens.;ON A POSSIBLE MEETING WITH COMMUNIST;CHINA;[17.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Mansfield also suggested--urged a meeting between Secretary Rusk and the Foreign Minister of Communist China. Can you give us your reaction as to whether you think this would be useful?;THE PRESIDENT. I read Senator Mansfield's speech with a great deal of interest and pleasure. I asked Secretary Rusk to give the majority leader's observations very careful consideration. He is doing that.;I have not discussed in detail with Senator Mansfield any information he may have about the willingness of the Chinese Foreign Minister to meet with Secretary Rusk. But I think we have made it very clear that we will be delighted to review the Senator's views, any information he has, and give careful consideration to them.;VIETNAM WAR COSTS;[18.] Q. Mr. President, in January the administration's estimate for the cost of the war in Vietnam in fiscal 1967 was $10.5 billion. I wondered as the beginning of the fiscal year approaches if there has been any revision of that figure up or down?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, the expenditures vary from month to month. You have high months and low months. The first several months they ran about as estimated. We had a month or two where they were high, and we had a month or two where they were less than expected.;We do not have any recent figures. We are trying to get as much information as we can as fast as we can this month. We would like to see the expenditure figure go up some because it would mean that we would get earlier deliveries and increase our effort.;But I am not in a position today to give you with any degree of accuracy what it will be. We have ample funds to take care of our needs. The Congress has provided generously for us, even more than I have asked in certain fields.;Perhaps early in July, the first 10 days, I can give you a little better figure on the fiscal year. It is not a great deal different, in my judgment, from what I have said before. We expect the deficit to be considerably less than we anticipated in January. That will be largely due to an increase in revenues. I would hope that some small part of it, a few hundred millions, could be the result of reduction in domestic expenditures or stretch-out in them.;My Budget Director constantly admonishes me not to give any hard and fast figure. In a budget of over $100 billion, with a 1 percent variance, it is very easy to be off a billion dollars. But I would say within that range that our deficit would probably be, instead of $6.4 billion as we predicted last January-it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of $3 billion to $4 billion deficit.;That estimate could be off a few hundred million. But the deficit will be much less than we predicted in January, and we think, much less than we predicted 18 months ago. We are very pleased with the administrators of this administration for having always had less deficit than they predicted--which is quite unusual they tell me in budget history. In our 3 Johnson administration years we have had less deficit each year than we promised.;We could have some unusual emergency come up, but I don't think we will miss it much in the next 12 days of this month.;COMMENTS OF U.S. SENATORS ABROAD;[19.] Q. Mr. President, can you give us your thinking, sir, on the propriety of a United States Senator going abroad and making critical comments about the internal policy of another nation?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that it would be a better policy to let the Senators judge the propriety of their own actions. It is not for the executive branch to be passing upon statements of Senators.;There are a great many statements made by the Senate that an Executive will approve of, and some maybe that he will disapprove of. But I don't think, as a general policy, it is wise for us to set up any censorship down here. I just have to leave it up to their judgment.;QUESTIONS ON THE VIETNAM STATEMENT;[20.] Q. Mr. President, you have today restated your determination to see the Vietnam war through. How can this point be made more clearly to Hanoi and the Vietcong? Isn't that the central problem?;THE PRESIDENT. I would hope that they take notice of our actions from time to time and I believe they do--of which the statement today is a part.;Q. Mr. President, in that connection, does the statement imply or mean that there may be a step-up in air strikes in North Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. I think you just have to take the statement and read it. We will stand on it. I would not want to get boxed in by a commitment to the New York Times that I would do this or that. I would want to feel at liberty to do whatever the national policy required, as I said in the statement.;And I think it is very clear on that, when you have a chance to read it. I know you would want your country to have some flexibility in case our national interests required it. If it does, I assure you we will exercise it.;FUTURE MEETINGS WITH SOUTH VIETNAMESE LEADERS;[21.] Q. Mr. President, do you still hope to meet Premier Ky 14 in Honolulu this summer?;THE PRESIDENT. We would like to have further meetings between representatives of this Government and the South Vietnamese Government as the civil program develops, as we step up our education and health and election methods--the general things we discussed at Honolulu.;14 Nguyen Cao Ky, Prime Minister of South Viet-Nam.;Just when that will be, and just who will be there will have to be determined by the events. But we do expect periodically to check on what advancements have been made and try to improve our efforts and expedite them as much as possible.;Mr. Komer will be going out there Sunday to meet with the leaders of the South Vietnamese Government and our own staff in this general field. As a result of his meetings with Mr. Porter, we have made a number of decisions and approved some of the suggestions of the Government of Vietnam. We will be cooperating in them.;A little later there will be other Cabinet members going out. I would hope that sometime during the year, after sufficient time elapses for our agricultural, education and health, and electoral programs to make headway that we can take a good look at them and see how they can be improved and expedited.;THE NEED FOR MAINTAINING A FLEXIBLE POSITION ON VIETNAM;[22.] Q. Mr. President, on your Vietnamese announcement, sir, would you care to give us your view, as you have at sometimes in the past, as to whether the expanded military activities will increase the risk of widening the war?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I think I will stand on my statement because I don't want to be speculative. I do not see that there is much to be gained by telegraphing your shots to the aggressor.;I tried to anticipate the yearning for particular moves of this kind, and to cover it in my statement. I don't want to get fenced in by a commitment to the Washington Post or any other person, so that I feel we can be flexible when we need to.;THE PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN PLANS;[23.] Q. Mr. President, can you tell us how you feel about a President campaigning in off-year elections and whether you intend to do so this fall?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think that the president certainly ought to and has the right to make his views known to his people. That is what I am doing this morning and expect to do so as long as I have these responsibilities.;I have no specific plans at this time. I have no doubt but what I will be expressing my views from time to time. There will be various interpretations placed upon them.;If I plan to go out in the hinterlands, I will be glad to try to give you as much notice as I have myself. I haven't made any decisions on any place at this time.;Q. Mr. President, Congressman Ford 15 is quoted this morning as now calling the Vietnam war "President Johnson's War." Do you feel that this or other things that have been said lately are harming the bipartisan approach to the effort?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't--I wouldn't want to comment on that. Let's not provoke any difficulties within the Government.;15 Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, minority leader of the House of Representatives.;THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL;[24.] Q. Mr. President, I wonder if you would give us your views on the chances of passing the open housing section of the civil rights bill?;THE PRESIDENT. We have made our recommendations. We see the developments and the problems. I talked to the Attorney General last night about the situation. I talked to some of the Members of Congress today. We do have difficulties. We are trying to resolve them and get a bill that can be approved by a majority of the Congress. We hope we will be successful.;I am not sure at this moment what will be the result of the Attorney General's conferences and his efforts with various individuals. The Members seem to be willing to give consideration to various approaches. They are making some. We are making some. I just have to see how successful we are.;Generally speaking, we are hopeful we will get a good civil rights bill as near our recommendations as possible. We don't always get all we ask for.;We have asked for about 91 bills this session and we expect the House to act on almost 70 of them before they leave on July 4. In the Senate, of the 91 there are about 33 that remain to be acted upon. We expect some of them to be acted on between now and the holidays. We think that the Congress will act very sympathetically on our recommendations as a general matter.;THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC;[25.] Q. Mr. President, when the Dominican crisis began last year, there were a lot of predictions of gloom and doom with our policies and those of the OAS with regard to the eventual outcome of events of the situation there. I wonder how you feel now that the thing has worked out pretty well. I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on that?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I did that in my statement. There is very little I can add to that, except that we went through a very difficult and trying period there, as we frequently do with problems in various parts of the world. But under the skilled leadership of the Provisional President, Garcia-Godoy, and Ambassador Bunker and the members of the OAS group, the people-more than a million of them--went to the polls and had a free choice. They selected a government of their own choosing. And very shortly that President will be inaugurated.;The decision was a decisive one. I have paid due recognition to the efforts of all parties involved, Mr. Bonnelly, Professor Bosch, Mr. Balaguer, and Ambassador Bunker. I would say that we are rather glad that the Dominican people had an election and they have made the decision. We look forward to working with them and helping in any way we can in their new efforts with their constitutional government.;Al Spivak, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference at the LBJ Ranch</td><td class="c6">July 5, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen;REPORT ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS;IN VIETNAM;[1.] Governor John Reed of Maine, who is Chairman of the National Governors' Conference, has requested that I send a team of U.S. officials to brief the Governors on current developments in Vietnam. He sent me a wire last evening to which I have already responded.;I am asking Ambassador Averell Harriman, Gen. Andy Goodpaster of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. Walt Rostow of the White House to go to Los Angeles for that purpose. They will stop here Wednesday for an overnight stay before going to Los Angeles.;I also asked General Goodpaster to talk to President Eisenhower and to give him a full report on current developments in Vietnam. He has just informed me that he has done that this afternoon.;I am asking this team to report in detail to the Governors on the progress that is being made to achieve a better life among the South Vietnamese people. I consider this "other war" as crucial to the the future of South Vietnam and Southeast Asia as the military struggle.;Already American assistance has added some 600,000 acres of irrigated land to the agriculture of South Vietnam. It has vastly increased crop yields in that country.;Under new land reform measures, a half million acres of land are being sold now to small farmers on easy terms. Another 700,000 acres of State-owned land will soon be distributed, I am told, to landless refugees from areas that have been controlled by the Vietcong.;Fish production has been more than doubled in the past 5 years.;Almost 13,000 village health stations have been established and stocked with medicine from the United States.;We are helping to build a medical school which will graduate as many doctors every year as now serve the entire civilian population of that area of 14 million people.;Primary and secondary school enrollment in South Vietnam has increased five times. By 1968, 13,000 new village classrooms will have been built to provide for over three-quarters of a million young schoolchildren. We have helped to distribute 7 million textbooks in the.past 3 years and we are providing 1,700 new teachers every year.;More than 10,000 Vietnamese are now receiving vocational training as a result of the program we have laid out in that country.;I believe this is a good record. It's a record I would like the American people to know more about. I hope that they will study it, observe it, give us their suggestions in the days to come.;We have not waited for the fighting to end before we have the beginnings of the works of peace. We are even now attacking with all of our strength the basic problems in Vietnam--illiteracy, poverty, disease. It is these problems that bring on the wars. We must continue to press this battle forward, and we will do so.;Mr. Komer, my Special Assistant in charge of this work, has just returned from South Vietnam with this report that I have summarized briefly for you.;DISCUSSIONS WITH SECRETARY MCNAMARA;AND CLARK CLIFFORD;[2.] I have asked Secretary McNamara to stop here tomorrow to discuss with me various matters prior to his meeting in Honolulu Friday with Admiral Sharp, Commander in Chief of the Pacific. During his 1-day meeting in Hawaii, Secretary McNamara will receive from Admiral Sharp a report on the program of military operations in Southeast Asia and will discuss logistical plans for future operations.;Mr. Clark Clifford, Chairman of the President's Advisory Board on Foreign Intelligence, will be coming to the ranch later today to review intelligence matters with me, and will stay overnight here at the ranch.;ANNOUNCEMENTS OF APPOINTMENTS;[3.] I am nominating Mr. Robert B. Bowie to be Counselor of the Department of State. Mr. Bowie is professor of international relations and director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. He has a distinguished record in the military service and in foreign policy and as a scholar in the field of international affairs. He will be a very valuable new member of the foreign policy advisers who serve the President and who serve this Nation.;[4.] Today I am nominating four new judges;Donald P. Lay of Omaha, to the U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit.;Walter J. Cummings, Jr., of Chicago, to the U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit.;Thomas E. Fairchild, of Milwaukee, to the U.S. Court of Appeals, 7th Circuit.;Theodore Cabot, of Fort Lauderdale, to be U.S. district judge for the southern district of Florida.;[5.] I am pleased also to make the following announcements of my intention to send these nominations to the Senate;--Mr. Wilfred Johnson, of Richland, Washington, to be a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. Mr. Johnson has been general manager of General Electric's nuclear activities at Hanford, Washington. He has been strongly recommended by the members of the Commission and by members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy in the Congress.;--Mr. Paul Miller, president of the University of West Virginia, to be the new Assistant Secretary for Education of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.;--Mr. Frank DiLuzio, Director of the Office of Saline Water, to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior in charge of our very new and important water pollution program that is in that Department.;VICE PRESIDENT'S REPORT ON DOMINICAN;REPUBLIC;[6.] I had the pleasure of visiting with the Vice President by telephone this morning and tie reported to me on his trip to the Dominican Republic where he represented our country at the inauguration of the new President that the people of that country have selected, Dr. Balaguer. 1;1 Dr. Joaquin Balaguer took office as President of the Dominican Republic on July 1, 1966.;He had high praise for the people and the leaders of the Dominican Republic for their perseverance and faith during the past year of this great crisis. He said the recent elections represent not only a respect for constitutional government, but the desire of the Dominican people for peace and tranquility.;I asked the Vice President to discuss with Dr. Balaguer the economic assistance which the United States has been providing the Dominican Republic in the past, and to analyze the future needs of that economy. Dr. Balaguer and his government face staggering problems.;I think you would be interested in knowing that approximately 25 percent of the working force in the Dominican Republic is presently unemployed.;The Vice President reports that the Dominican Government is moving to face these problems forcefully, and he believes effectively.;I will discuss the Vice President's report with Secretary Rusk and other officials to make certain we are doing everything we can to assist the courageous people of the Dominican Republic. Mr. Rostow is already analyzing and evaluating the Vice President's report and will have recommendations for me when he arrives tomorrow.;They seem determined to make constitutional government work in the Dominican Republic and to improve the well-being of every citizen. I know that all Americans wish them well.;SECRETARY MCNAMARA'S REPORT ON;BUILDUP OF FORCES IN VIETNAM;[7.] I have today received from Secretary McNamara an appraisal of the efficiency of the buildup of the United States forces in Vietnam. I am pleased, as his report indicates that he will attempt to reduce the planned rates of production substantially 90 to 180 days from now.;In the report to the President by Secretary McNamara he says;Approximately 1 year ago the buildup of our forces in Vietnam was initiated at your direction. I believe it is timely," he says, "to report to you the results of that action.;First, I would point out that never before in our history has it been possible to accomplish such a rapid and such an effective expansion of our Armed Forces without the need to mobilize the Reserve forces, and to call up the Reserves, to impose stringent economic controls and emergency controls on our economy, or to require involuntary extensions of active duty throughout the services.;As Commander in Chief, you have reason to be proud of the magnificent professional leadership which our men in Vietnam are receiving from General William C. Westmoreland, his officers, and his noncommissioned officers and men. This matchless leadership is paralleled by the fact that no military force has been so well supplied.;Despite the fact that we deployed a military force of more than 100,000 men within 120 days and sent them halfway around the world, we have been able to keep that force constantly supplied and equipped so that at all times they have been capable of bringing to bear their full power against the aggressor.;As General Earle G. Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has reported;There have been no shortages in supplies for the troops in Vietnam which have adversely affected combat operations or the health or welfare of our troops. No required air sorties have been canceled. As a matter of fact, the air support given our forces is without parallel in our history.;With ample inventory stocks still on hand, our production of ammunition and air ordnance this month will exceed our consumption this month.;Indeed," says Secretary McNamara, "I believe it may very well prove desirable to reduce planned rates of production substantially. Such action would be in keeping with your insistence that the Department of Defense make certain that all military requirements are fulfilled, while achieving this objective with maximum economy for our taxpayers. By continuing to carefully adjust expenditures and production and by resisting the temptation to ask for more money and to spend more money than we need, I believe," says the Secretary, "we can avoid the carryover that was represented by $12 billion of surplus and worthless materiel with which we concluded the Korean war.;Our buildup has been responsive. It has been forceful, and it has been effective.;BUDGET DEFICIT;[8.] Just one brief note in conclusion: While final figures on the receipts and expenditures for fiscal 1966 which ended June 30th are not yet available, it is very clear to me this morning, after a conference with the Chairman of the President's Economic Advisers and the Director of the Bureau of the Budget, 2 that the administrative budget deficit for this year will be very substantially below the $5.3 billion originally estimated in January 1965, and far below the $6.4 billion forecast this past January.;2 Gardner Ackley and Charles L. Schultze.;This marks the third straight year in which the actual deficit has been lower than what the President predicted. In fiscal 1964 the actual deficit was $3.7 billion below what the President promised the Congress in his estimate. In 1965 it was $1 1/2 billion below what the President had recommended in his estimate.;We will not know the final 1966 figures for several weeks, but it is already clear that the reduction in the deficit below our original estimate of 18 months ago will be greater than we achieved in 1965.;In the 10 years prior to fiscal 1964, the actual budget outcome averaged $2.9 billion worse than the original predicted figure.;I believe the fiscal outcome for the past year and for the previous years for which I am responsible demonstrates three things;First, we have tried to make a realistic estimate of both our revenues and expenditures, and to be conservative and careful in those estimates.;Second, we have made an unremitting effort to hold our expenditures wherever possible at or below our initial estimates.;I am proud to tell you that I believe that will be done so far as domestic expenditures are concerned this year by several hundred millions of dollars.;Third, we have maintained the strength and health of our economy so that revenues each year have exceeded our estimates for that year, which the Budget Director tells me is somewhat unusual.;We are determined to maintain a sound and a healthy economy which will provide the revenues that we will need to meet our responsibilities in the years ahead.;Now I'll be glad to take your questions if you have any.;QUESTIONS;EFFECTS OF AIRSTRIKES IN NORTH VIETNAM;[9.] Q. Mr. President, going back to the subject of Vietnam, what have been the effects of our intensified airstrikes on military targets in North Vietnam? What has been the effect on their rate of infiltration? In other words, what have been the noticeable results since we started hitting the oil tanks?;THE PRESIDENT. The evaluations that we have, and they are still coming in--we have new pictures that are being analyzed at this moment--the evaluations that we have indicate that about 86 percent of the known petroleum storage capacity in North Vietnam was hit the other evening in a very accurate target operation over the POL targets in the vicinity of Hanoi and Haiphong.;The latest estimate of the storage capacity actually destroyed that has come in from the field is 57 percent.;In other words, 86 percent of the storage was hit, 57 percent they estimate is destroyed.;I cannot embrace those figures because the pictures are not complete. But the general officers who have reviewed this told me this morning that they think both estimates are within reason, and they think it was a very successful operation.;I think that every general officer carrying responsibilities, either in Vietnam or in the Pentagon, as well as most of our career, experienced, diplomatic observers, think that this action at this time was required by the events of the time.;SELECTIVE SERVICE REVIEW;[10.] Q. Mr. President, last Saturday you ordered an exhaustive review of the Selective Service. 3 On the basis of your conversations with your advisers, Congressmen, and what you have heard from the general public, what is your appraisal of the defects and shortcomings of the military draft as it is now administered?;THE PRESIDENT. We have developed the best system that we have known how to, in the light of our experiences.;3 See Item 315.;We have asked the Pentagon to review it from their standpoint, and they have done so. They are now presenting their views to the appropriate committees in the Congress.;I have asked some of our most distinguished citizens--Mr. Burke Marshall, former Assistant Attorney General, Mr. Thomas Gates, former Secretary of Defense under General Eisenhower, Mrs. Oveta Culp Hobby, former Director of the WACS and a Cabinet officer under General Eisenhower-and some of the best talent in this Nation to review all the alternatives available to a country which finds it necessary to draft its young men.;I don't want to prejudge that study. That study is in the process of being made. We will have a very competent staff. We expect to have some conclusions and some recommendations to present to the next session of Congress in ample time for them to carefully consider before the present draft law expires.;STATUS OF BUILDUP IN VIETNAM;[11.] Q. Mr. President, in view of your statement at the beginning of the news conference, in which you talked about the successful military buildup, and also about the fact that we may be able to cut back some of our military production, would it be accurate for us, Mr. President, to analyze this as indicating that the major part of the buildup has now been accomplished in Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I wouldn't make such an evaluation.;I would say so far as ammunition is concerned the Secretary hopes that within 90 to 180 days he can make some recommendations. I think it is his feeling that those recommendations that he will make, which will have the support of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will result in the saving of several hundreds of millions of dollars over what the cost would be at the present rate.;That is not to indicate, though, that we will not call up additional men, that we will not train additional men, that we will not procure additional planes, that we will not procure additional helicopters, that we will not send additional people overseas--because we will do all of those things.;But we are watching it very carefully so we won't have a $12 billion holdover at the end of the difficulties in Vietnam.;LATIN AMERICA;[12.] Q. Mr. President, could you assess the prospects now for democracy and for continued economic and social growth in Latin America in view of the military takeover in Argentina and prior to that in Brazil?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We regret the action that took place in Argentina recently. We have had similar actions of that type in the last year, two or three instances. They are less in the last few months than they have been heretofore.;We are very encouraged by what has happened generally in Latin America. We are very proud of our record of growth there.;We are spending about a billion dollars, or a little in excess of a billion dollars, in our Alliance for Progress program in Latin America.;We find the per capita growth rate has jumped from 1 percent to in excess of 2 1/2 percent. That already equals and exceeds the goals that we had set for the Alliance for Progress.;Notwithstanding the grave predictions made and the discouragement that the Dominican people received from many quarters, they have had a peaceful election. A majority of the people have exercised their democratic right to select a government of their own choosing.;They have selected that government.;They have just finished a similar exercise in Guatemala, and some four or five additional Latin American nations.;THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW OF THE WORLD SITUATION GENERALLY;[13.] We would say, as we look around the world, at this hemisphere, Latin America, the prosperity, the democratic evolution that is taking place, when we look over Africa, look over Southeast Asia generally-with the exception of our problem in Vietnam--when we take a look at the Middle East and Western Europe, we have much to be thankful for, generally speaking, much to be encouraged about.;Now I find that true and that to be the judgment of most of our experienced career diplomats.;We think that on practically every continent--when you look back at Africa just a few months ago, at the serious problems we had in the Congo, and so forth, you look at the Dominican Republic, the Panama situation, the difficulties we had in Brazil, the problems in Chile--we have made great progress and generally speaking we are optimistic about most of the continents.;If we could only solve the problem in Vietnam, and we think we are on the way to doing that, we could have a world that is rather peaceful and generally prosperous.;PUBLIC OPINION POLLS;[14.] Q. Mr. President, surveys of every kind are being conducted about you. Some of them recently showed a drop in your performance rating. Today the Harris poll gave you high points for your Vietnam action. Last week a newspaper poll in California said that the California Democrats prefer Senator Robert Kennedy over you two-to-one.;How much are you influenced by these polls?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think we all read them and are affected by them.;We of course would like for every poll to be of our liking. We like to feel that all of them are accurate. We have had a dozen polls, I guess, in the last week.;You don't read about the favorable ones, though, I've observed.;Mr. Gallup reported last week that we had gained 4 percent. Mr. Harris reports today that we have about 55 percent of the total in the country. Mr. Quayle has made a nationwide survey and he shows about 55 percent.;Now that's what you reported as a landslide during General Eisenhower's period.;Our poll in California shows a very healthy majority for approval of our record. We believe that it will show the same thing in Iowa.;Those are the only two polls that you have cited.;We have a number of them that come to us each day. If you are interested in them I will see that Mr. Moyers makes them available to you.;Maine shows 57-43 percent. That is unusual for a Democratic administration.;New Hampshire, 53-47, New Jersey, 7624, Michigan, 62-38. Although Governor Romney has a substantial majority of the Democrats favoring his record as Governor, we lead Governor Romney in his own State.;In Tennessee it is 61-39. That is considerably better than we were in 1964. Virginia is 53-47, Texas, 58-42.;We have a good many polls from all over the country. They are not disturbing to us. We think that a 55 percent rating in the country--that is the landslide that General Eisenhower defeated Mr. Adlai Stevenson by. So we are not upset.;We would all like to have as much approval as we can get. But we have to make our judgments and do what we think is right. Then we trust the judgment of the people at election time. I have not the slightest doubt but what they will exercise good judgment.;ASSESSMENT OF SITUATION IN VIETNAM;[15.] Q. Mr. President, there have been many favorable comments lately in the press by military leaders on Vietnam. Could you give us your assessment of the situation as it is today?;THE PRESIDENT. I think our boys under General Westmoreland, his staff officers and the men they are leading, are doing an exceptionally fine job. I want to encourage them in every way I can. I want to support them in every way I can.;I am fearful that sometimes we do not give enough thought to those men as we sit here in the luxury of our front porch and our lawn, that we don't recognize the men that are dying for us out in the rice paddies.;I don't think you can speak too well of them. Their record has been outstanding. Their results are very good.;Our diplomatic reports indicate that the opposing forces no longer really expect a military victory in South Vietnam.;I am aware of the dangers of speculation. You don't pay me anything extra for it. So I am not going to guess for you.;Suffice it to say, I am proud of what the men are doing. If everyone in this country was working as hard to support the principles of democracy as the men in Vietnam are, I think we would have little to worry about.;PUBLIC REACTION TO VIETNAM BOMBINGS;[16.] Q. Mr. President, can you tell us anything about the public reaction as reflected in the telegrams and letters to you on your decision to bomb the Haiphong and Hanoi oil fields?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;First of all, all the Communist countries, generally speaking, opposed it rather vehemently. Some of them were rather vicious in their statements, and I think inaccurate, that we were bombing civilian targets and killing civilians.;We were very careful to select military targets that were not in the center of the area and to spare all civilians. We took every precaution available to us.;I cannot understand the thinking of any country or any people, or any person, that says we should sit by with our hands tied behind us while these men bring their mortars, their hand grenades and their bombs into our barracks and kill our Marines, attack our camps, murder the village chief, and that we should not do anything about it.;Now we have tried to make this difficult for them to continue at their present rate. We do not say it will stop the infiltration. We do not say that it will even reduce it.;But we do think it will make it more difficult for them, and we do think it will require them to assign additional people. We do think it will give them problems.;We have had a policy of measured response and gradually increased our strength from time to time. We plan to continue that.;Most of the Communist countries expressed disapproval. Most of the countries in the area involved, and all of the countries who have bodies there, who have men in uniform there, approved our action.;It is difficult for me to understand the response of some nation that is not involved, when a few years ago when their own security was at stake they needed American men and they wanted us to furnish American troops, not to be understanding of what we are trying to do to help others maintain their independence now.;I would say that we had very encouraging reports from a good many of our allies. We were disappointed in a few. We expected the regular Communist response, namely, that this would harden the opposition, and that it would not lead to negotiations, that we were killing civilians, and that we were not bombing military targets.;But all those things we considered in advance. And we think we pursued the right course.;Since you are talking about polls, I am informed today that the national polls show that 85 percent of the people of this country approved this position. I think we did the right thing at the right time. I hope that we can continue to be as successful in the days ahead in connection with General Westmoreland's operations as we were in this particular exercise.;PROGRESS TOWARD EQUAL OPPORTUNITY;[17.] Q. Mr. President, regarding racial incidents, sir, in various cities, what is your estimate of the immediate hazards in the situation, and do you have any advice for Americans in this connection?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We are trying in every way we can to find employment for the unemployed in our cities. We are trying in every way we can to get people to quit practicing discrimination in our cities. We are trying to meet the poverty situation as we find it with the limited resources at our command.;We are not interested in black power and we are not interested in white power. But we are interested in American democratic power, with a small "d." We believe that the citizen ought to be armed with the power to vote. We believe the citizen, regardless of his race or his religion or color, ought to be armed with the right to have a job at decent wages.;We believe that every citizen ought to have the right to have a decent home. We are doing everything we can, as quickly as we can, under our voters rights bill, under our civil rights bills, under our housing bills, under proposals we have made in cooperation with the mayors under the able leadership of the Vice President, to improve these terrible conditions that exist in the ghettos of this country.;Now we can't do it all overnight. We are much too late. But we have done more in the last 24 months than has been done in any similar 24-year period to face up to these conditions of health, education, poverty, and discrimination.;We are going to continue as long as I am President to do everything we can to see that all citizens are treated equally and have equal opportunities. When we achieve that, I think we will find a good deal of the solution to the problem which you mentioned.;PARIS REPORT ON HO CHI MINH STATEMENT;[18.] Q. Mr. President, a Paris magazine, a French magazine, reports that Ho Chi Minh told Red China and the Soviet Union if they didn't give more help he would have to come to terms with us next year. Have you anything on that?;THE PRESIDENT. I haven't read the Paris magazines.;NUCLEAR WEAPON TREATY;[19.] Q. Mr. President, how do you assess the chances now for a treaty banning the spread of nuclear weapons? Does your decision to bomb closer to Hanoi and Halphong in any way jeopardize that?;THE PRESIDENT. No, we don't think so. We are doing everything we can to reach an agreement on such a treaty. We are very anxious to do it. We hope the Soviet Union will meet us and find an acceptable compromise in language which we can both live with.;They have some problems at the moment, but we are going to live up to the test ban treaty, religiously and scrupulously follow it. We are going to do everything within the power of our most imaginative people to find language which will bring the nuclear powers together in a treaty which will provide nonproliferation. We think it is one of the most important decisions of our time and we are going to do everything to bring people together on it.;THE PRESIDENT'S PLANS FOR 1966 AND 1968;[20.] Q. Sir, in light of these recently published polls, can you give us your thinking now about running again in 1968?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I think you will see a good deal of me this year. I have been in about 10 States in the last several weeks. I expect to get around the country and talk to the people about our problems and our programs.;But I have no announcements to make about my own future except to say I am going to do my dead-level best to serve all the people of this country.;Q. Mr. President, in light of the upcoming elections, do you plan to do much traveling between now and November?;THE PRESIDENT. We have a legislative program yet to be acted on. We have more than half of it already enacted. We had about 85 percent of it enacted last year. We hope to get a substantial part of it completed in the next few months.;As time permits, I will be traveling throughout the country. I have been in the States of New York, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, Virginia, Maryland, Iowa, and New Jersey all in the last 3 or 4 weeks. At that rate, we could cover all 50 of them between now and, say, late October.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at the Post Office in Jeffersonville, Indiana.</td><td class="c6">July 23, 1966</td><td class="c7">Governor Branigin, Mayor Vissing, Senator Hartke, Senator and Mrs. Bayh, Congressman and Mrs. Hamilton and their three lovely children, distinguished Members of the United States Senate, Governors, Members of the Congress, Postmaster James Stanforth, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls;I came here to Jeffersonville for two reasons: to please my wife and to please myself. Postmaster General Larry O'Brien has been telling Lady Bird that the Jeffersonville Post Office has been in the forefront of the beautification program.;Your own very able, progressive, fine leader, your Congressman Lee Hamilton, has been telling me that Jeffersonville has some of the finest people in the United States.;If you haven't already guessed it, I think I should let you in on a secret. I value Postmaster General Larry O'Brien's judgment. I value Lady Bird's judgment. I value Lee Hamilton's judgment. And here I am.;Without indicating any preference, I will deal with Mrs. Johnson's project first.;About a year ago we had 16 postmasters at the White House to receive an award. Mrs. Johnson presented each one of them with a citation for their outstanding efforts to make their post offices a beautiful addition to their community.;Your own Postmaster James Stanforth was not there. The post office here was so new that he and his staff had not had a chance to prove themselves. Since then, in record time, they have become one of the less than 300 out of some 34,000 possible candidates to deserve this citation. And so tonight we are going to present it to them and to you wonderful people in this community.;The inscription reads: "President Lyndon B. Johnson's natural beauty program citation of merit to the community of Jeffersonville, Indiana, and all of its postal employees for maintaining the grounds and the exterior of their postal unit in such a manner as to reflect credit upon the community and the Post Office Department.;[At this point Postmaster Stanforth spoke briefly. The President then resumed speaking.];I think if Thomas Jefferson, for whom I assume your community was named, could be here tonight he would like what I see.;You know Thomas Jefferson was the father of the Democratic Party. Thomas Jefferson felt that the judgment of the many was much to be preferred to the decision of the few.;I am so happy that we can come in here this late in the evening--it is 9 o'clock by a watch that was set in some State that we appeared in today, I don't know what time it is here--to see hundreds or thousands of people who think enough of their community, their State, and their country to come here and give us this welcome, and to participate in this civic affair.;Thomas Jefferson said that the care of human life and happiness is the first and only legitimate object of government. And that is what we have been doing today. We have been trying to show our concern for the care of human life and happiness. We have been trying to make it evident that it was the first and legitimate objective of this administration and of this Government.;We believe that we must be strong in order to protect the things that we have that other people would like to take away from us. And after seeing the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division this afternoon, we have no doubt about our strength.;But we do not want to be strong in order to be able to wage or win wars. We want to be strong so we can prevent war and bring peace.;Your Government, and your administration, is ready at this hour, as it has been every hour since I have been President, to talk instead of fight, to negotiate instead of bomb, to reason instead of try to force.;But this is not a one-way street. It takes two to enter into an agreement. You can't have a unilateral treaty. You can't stop everything you are doing unless the other fellow will stop some of the things that he is doing.;So we continue to hope and work and try to hold our hand out, but keep our guard up.;We want to be strong so that we can have the better things of life, better education for our children. We have 24 new education bills that we have enacted, we are putting into effect, that will make this year the greatest year for education in the history of this Nation.;We want to be strong so we can have good health, health for our older people with medical care so, for the first time in their lives, they will not have to depend on their son or son-in-law, or their daughter or daughter-in-law, to minister to their needs. So that with dignity and respect they can take their admission card and go to a home or to a hospital and receive doctors' care and nursing care and medicine.;We not only are proud of what we have done for the medical care for our older people. But we are glad of what we are doing in the field of medical research for our younger people, how we are detecting the deficiencies as they appear and trying to correct them before a life is ruined or a soul is lost.;This will be the greatest year for health in this country in the history of the American Government. You read all about the prophets of gloom and doom. You heard all about the protests. You had all the warnings of what was going to happen when we put medical care in. But July 1st came and went.;The program was put in with a minimum of inconvenience and with a maximum of efficiency. And while every hospital didn't qualify, 90-odd percent of them did. The most revolutionary medical program in the history of our Nation is now in effect and it is going to serve our country long and well.;It is here because of people like you--men, women, and children like you--that Jefferson believed in, people who would come here and participate in the affairs of their Government, people who believe that the care of human life and happiness is the first and only legitimate object of government.;So I think that Jefferson would have been pleased to know what we have done in education, what we have done in health, what we have done in beautification, what we have done to conserve our resources, what we have done to develop our recreation areas, what we have done to try to wage a war on poverty, what we have done to improve our skills, what we have done to train additional manpower, what we have done to reduce unemployment, what we have done to increase wages, what we have done to improve minimum wages and hours.;All of these things involve the care of human life and happiness. That is the first and only legitimate object of government.;Here, tonight, in Jeffersonville, I salute Thomas Jefferson and his followers. I also salute Lee Hamilton because that is the second reason that I wanted to come here. I wanted to meet personally you people that he has been talking to me so much about.;Lee Hamilton has been one of the outstanding freshmen Congressmen ever since the first day he appeared in Washington. He has always voted his conscience and he hasn't always voted for me. The people of Indiana have done the same.;Even when we disagree, it is easy to respect people who stand up and look like he looks, who stand up and state what they believe with the sincerity and the conviction that he does. This Congressman, and his new generation which he represents, has joined with other Congressmen from both parties to help us pass more creative legislation for the care of human life and happiness, for the benefit of human beings, than any Congress has ever passed in all the history of the United States.;Now I have made no secret of the fact that in my opinion there has never been a better Congress. There have been few times in American history when a President of the United States would ever make a statement like that, though. I am not sure that all of you would want to make a statement like that if you would pick up a paper and see what the Congress says about me sometimes. George Washington, our first president, once warned that his Congress was about "to form the worst government on earth.;Another great President, Theodore Roosevelt, said that he would like to turn 16 lions loose on his Congress. When someone pointed out that the lions might make a mistake, he replied, "Not if they stay there long enough.;Well, I spent almost 24 years in the Congress as a Member and about 5 years as a congressional secretary, 5 years as majority leader and 2 years as minority leader. So it is with some humility that I say tonight that this present 89th Congress, as Luci would say, is "the greatest.;Well now, how do you confirm that? And why do you say that? What proof do you have?;First of all, they passed legislation to fulfill a promise made more than a century ago, a promise of emancipation. Abraham Lincoln, more than 100 years ago, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But it was a proclamation and not a fact.;Today, where once some people were afraid to vote, they now proudly walk into the polling place with their chin up and their chest out.;This Congress passed legislation to ease the burden of sickness. Today, although everyone must face old age, they are no longer dependent on their kinfolks for their medical care.;They passed legislation that should brighten every classroom in America. This year we will spend, in appropriations, $10 billion more on education and health than we were spending on those subjects when I became President less than 3 years ago. That is progress.;And that does show that the Congress, as well as the Cabinet and the President, are concerned with what Jefferson said was the object of government: the care of human life and happiness.;Once the children of poverty began life on a hopeless road toward despair. Tonight they at least have some new hope. They are at least receiving some new training. And we are at least making taxpayers out of taxeaters of a few weeks ago.;We passed a poverty program for $750 million for 1 year and then $1 billion 500 million for the next year, more than double. For the third year, notwithstanding the fact that we have 400,000 men in the Vietnam area fighting to protect our security, our liberty, and our freedom, we will pass a program of $1 billion 750 million this year in order to provide for the needs of the underprivileged and try to 'prepare them and train them to make their own way in life.;This Congress told our cities and told our industries that they had to stop polluting our water and poisoning our air.;This Congress passed legislation to dam our rivers to prevent floods, to produce power, to provide beaches, to build playgrounds for our children, and to add more parks to the national domain than any other similar period in history.;They gave us the blueprints for a rapid rail system to carry our commuters of tomorrow. We have designed and will shortly let a contract on a supersonic airplane that will fly more than 2,000 miles an hour and transport hundreds of passengers around the globe.;They passed a farm bill that puts more income in the farmer's pocket and at the same time allows him to compete at home and abroad. They have reduced farm surpluses that one time hung heavy over every farmer's head to the lowest minimum that we have had in a dozen years.;And finally, with some help, some pleasant persuading, they served notice that we will battle with all we have to preserve the bounty of the land and the beauty of the countryside.;Thanks to Senator Yarborough, they passed a new GI bill to help our veterans get an education after they have fought for our liberty.;And lest Lee Hamilton, Senator Yarborough, and the other Senators and Congressmen think that we say, "Well done," and "This is the end of the day and there is nothing for tomorrow," I might add quickly, "The job is not yet finished.;Democracy's work is never finished. But there is no doubt in my mind of the road that we are going to take. We are going to continue to plow the furrow and go full steam straight ahead.;We will give new meaning to the American promise of justice and equality.;We will honor our commitments abroad. And we will do it without neglecting our duties at home.;While we are doing all that I told you we are doing, we have been maintaining 400,000 men--and they have been giving a mighty good account of themselves--in Vietnam, and we have got the lowest deficit this year that we have had since 1960.;Now I am not sure you have read about that. I have announced it. But if you haven't read about it, you have heard about it, and you are going to hear more about it between now and the time I leave my present office.;We are going to do all of this, and we are going to do more of it because we know now that it can be done. Men like your Congressmen have proved for us that this job can be done during the last 2 years and we are going to do it the next 2 years.;We have proved that there is enough room at the table for all of us. We don't have to fight like cats--the businessman, the worker, the farmer, the Democrat and the Republican. I am here to tell you that notwithstanding any rumors you might have heard, that big table is growing bigger every day.;Two years ago, in the heat of a presidential election campaign, I came to Indiana. I told your neighbors in Evansville that I was not mad at anybody. I said that I had not come to Indiana to say anything bad about anybody. I said that I did not want to fight with anybody, that all I wanted was to try to do my best to put my Nation's best foot forward, to try to find an area of agreement for my fellow men and try to help unite my country instead of divide my country. It may be old-fashioned, but I still believe that my country does most things right.;I know there are some that like to keep it a secret, but I take great pride in talking about what we are doing to educate little children, what we are doing to help older people when they are sick, what we are doing to try to increase the freedom of the farmer and increase his income at the same time, and what we have done in 5 years to get 7 million more people jobs at an average factory wage in this country of $112 a week, the highest that was ever realized by any industrial nation. I am proud of those things.;I am sorry that we had difficulties in the Dominican Republic. But I am glad that it is not a Communist government today.;I am sorry that we have our men in Vietnam. But I had rather have them there with honor, doing their duty, keeping their commitment, carrying that flag with pride and honor, than to tuck their tail and come running home and break their word. And if I know anything about those men, they had rather be there doing it, too.;When they talk to you about all these horrors, you ask them whether it is from the men who are there or the men who don't want to be there, or who it is that feels that this Nation should not act with honor. I get about 100 letters a week from those men. And I have yet to get one letter from a man that says to me that he wants to get out and come home, that he does not want to stay there and do his job.;They are my single greatest source of strength, the men on the front lines. I saw them in the hospitals the first of the week. I saw them on the boat, the ones that are now being treated. I saw them at the 101st Airborne this afternoon. I take great pride in how our men feel about their country.;I think the time has come in America for us to find some of the good things that America is doing instead of spending all of our time complaining about the faults we have.;I remember a great man who served 50 years in Washington and heard a lot of speeches made. He served with over 3,000 Congressmen and Senators. He served with 6 or 7 Presidents. He used to say he served "with" them, not "under" them. He was Speaker Sam Rayburn.;He always said, when he had finished the day's work and he had come down and had heard about the complaints and the errors, and the mistakes and the criticism, "It is mighty easy to make a point about anything and anybody." He said he never could forget what his father of 11 children said to him one time: that any donkey can kick a barn down, but it takes an awful good carpenter to build one.;So I want to try to unite this country, to bring peace to it and to bring progress to it. I believe all my fellow men want to do the same. We may have different views and different routes to follow, but as your President tonight I want to say that is what I am trying to do. I am trying it with all the energy and whatever ability I possess.;I am trying to use whatever experience I have gained in the House, in the Senate, and in the Government to make progress for our people.;And we are having some little success.;My short visit to four States today tells me that we have reason to raise our hopes. For "if," as Abraham Lincoln said, "the end comes out all right, it will not be the President who does it, it will not be the Congress which does it, but it will really be the good sense of the American people.;I have seen that good sense today. As I leave here after my seventh or eighth appearance, I want to say that you have helped to refill the wells of my hopes for my country. I never have any doubt about it. But now and then we have some writers that go out on the countryside and make their private reports. I read those reports and wonder. But today I came and I saw.;I don't want to put my judgment up against theirs. And I don't want to speak with any finality. But before I conclude I just want to say that whatever little experience I have had in understanding human nature and knowing and loving people, somehow or other I get the general impression that the people of this country are ready and willing to follow a constructive course instead of a destructive course, that they want one who builds instead of one who tears down, that they would rather have a carpenter handling matters than a donkey handling them.;I don't have any particular sample polls to give you here tonight. But somehow or other I think that in the good old American tradition, in the city hall, the county seat, the statehouse, and finally in the Congress, that the American people are going to vote for the men that try to unite them instead of the men that try to divide them, that they are going to support the men that they think refuse to play on the bigotry and the prejudice and spend their time complaining. They are going to vote for the people who spend their time building and speaking constructively.;So it gives me a lot of pleasure to come here to this beautiful site and look at what you have done with your post office, and most of all look at what you have done with yourselves.;I owe Lee Hamilton a debt for really making me come. We have a lot of pickets that like to set themselves up around the White House. This is a day when people like to march. And Lee has really been picketing the White House. I thought it would be easier to come over here tonight than to spend next month explaining to him why I couldn't.;So here I am!;You have done more for me than I have done for you. But in the days ahead, let's enter a little compact. Let's do something for each other and thus do something for the men that are protecting our freedom and our liberties and thus doing something for our country.;We have the very best system of government in all the world. And we have the very best country in all the world. We have more prosperity than any other people in all the world.;Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves and developing a martyr complex, I would like to express this hope: that you go home tonight and think about how many blessings you have.;As I walked down that line today and I saw those seriously wounded men, I thought of the men that had died for me in order that I could be free, not only my generation, but several before mine.;So I think we ought to count our blessings once in a while. We have a lot to be thankful for. So when you leave here, go home and thank Him who is responsible for it all. Thank the good Lord Almighty.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">August 24, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. The Press Secretary tells me that some of you wanted to meet with me today. I am available for any questions you may want to ask.;THE VICE-PRESIDENCY IN 1968;[1.] Q. Mr. President, former Vice President Nixon said yesterday that he guessed that we might see a Johnson-Kennedy ticket in 1968, and that this might be some added insurance for you.;I was wondering if you could give us your estimate of Mr. Nixon's political perspicacity.;THE PRESIDENT. No. I think the people of the country have a pretty good estimate of that. And I will just leave it at that.;THE COST OF LIVING;[2.] Q. Mr. President, the cost of living went up again in July and you are looking into rising medical costs. Now, I realize this is a repetitive line of questioning, but I wonder if you are considering any new steps in this direction other than examination of the situation.;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We constantly review what is taking place, and the emphasis, and psychology, and factual information.;The increases from July last year to July this year were about 2 1/2 percent in the Consumer Price Index, compared to the average since World War II of about 2.6 percent per year, so they have been a little under it. With the rise yesterday, they will be approximately what the average has been since World War II, per year.;In some years, in the early 1960's, when we had a good deal of unemployment, and late 1950's, it was lower. In some years, like 1957, it was higher.;We are constantly receiving evaluations of these developments. We are concerned at the advance in physicians' fees and hospital costs, which were rather substantial the first 6 months of this year and were reflected in the estimate yesterday.;We are concerned with increased transportation costs, as reflected in the index yesterday.;We are very hopeful that we can appeal to those who set the standards on wages to keep their wage demands within reasonable bounds of productivity increases. We hope that those who determine profit margins will exercise self-restraint.;There is little I can add to what I said in my weekend statement on the economy. I recognize that when you have the full employment that we have, you are going to have problems with wages and prices. We are going to keep them in bounds as best we can. And as of now we think that record is reasonably good.;Prices have gone up roughly 10 percent since 1960. Wages have gone up roughly 17 percent during that same period. Profits have gone up 83 percent. So, as long as you can keep your wages and your profits up that much, you can understand that there will be some increase in prices.;Now, we are going to try to keep them all as stable as possible, but when you have wages rising, prices will rise--and they do rise over a period of 6 years, and they have risen over the last year--but comparably speaking, and relatively speaking, not as much as elsewhere.;I was talking to a distinguished leader of another country not long ago. He was rather hoping that he could keep his prices and wages and profits in line with ours. It may be that the Government will have to take other measures. But we are not ready to recommend them at this time. We are very anxious to see what the Congress does with the more than a dozen appropriation bills that are yet to be acted upon.;I can give you a little more information after we see whether they cut our budget or whether they add to our budget.;PARTY CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE AWARD OF;GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS;[3.] Q. Mr. President, sir, in House debate on the appropriations for Project Mohole last week and again in a syndicated column in a morning paper here this morning, there have been suggestions that contributions to the President's Club of the Democratic Party may influence the award of Government contracts. Do you have any comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. No, they do not influence the award. And I think that you can expect to have periodic political charges of this kind until November. That has been my experience.;The Attorney General has instructions from the President to investigate every allegation that is made of impropriety and to take prompt action on any, where action is justified.;The Attorney General has a rather full statement on the various political charges that have been made. You will observe they usually come from the party that has been rather strongly rejected by the people and I guess they have to try to find an issue of some kind.;THE COST OF REBUILDING CITIES;[4.] Q. Mr. President, there seems to be an argument running over how much this country should spend to rebuild the cities. What do you think the country can afford?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we can afford whatever must be done. This administration has done more than any administration in the history of the country. I believe that the present expenditures in the cities would indicate that the Federal Government in the last 3 years has increased its expenditures about 33 1/3 percent, a third more than the previous administration.;And I believe the administration before that, Mr. Eisenhower's administration--we have practically doubled the expenditures in the cities that we were making then.;We have increased the expenditures since the Johnson administration from about onethird. So, we are going to concern ourselves deeply with the problem of the cities as evidenced by our recommendations of the demonstration cities bill, the new housing bill that we passed last year, the poverty bill, the rent supplement bill, the Teacher Corps bill.;No administration has ever, in its entirety, ever made as many recommendations, ever had as many of them adopted, or ever spent as much in the cities as this administration.;I don't want to get an exact figure, but I believe that we are spending about double what was spent in the Eisenhower administration and about 33 percent more than was spent in the Kennedy administration.;Q. Mr. President, would you consider the $50 billion over 10 years that Mayor Lindsay suggested for New York and the $250 billion that Mr. Cavanagh 1 suggested for all cities--are those figures realistic in any respect?;THE PRESIDENT. I haven't examined their views on the matter. I am aware that some Federal funds that have been available to some of those cities, funds that haven't even been used, have been turned back because they were lacking in administrative procedures and so forth.;1 Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City and Mayor Jerome P. Cavanagh of Detroit, Mich.;But the administration has made its recommendations. The Senate has acted upon those recommendations. They reduced our bill from about $2.3 billion to about $900 million and no amendments were offered to increase it when it was considered in the Senate.;We do hope that we can get some kind of a demonstration cities bill this year and we will make a very good beginning. Of course, we are sure that that will have to be increased from year to year. But the first step is to get the bill passed. 2;2 The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act (80 Stat. 1255) was approved on November 3 (see Item 574).;The bill that the administration recommended has been drastically reduced in the Senate.;VIETNAM;[5.] Q. Mr. President, do you detect any change in the strategy of the enemy in Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. Oh, yes. There are day-to-day changes that we observe. But I see no overall development that is worthy of particular significance at this time.;URBAN BACKLASH AND THE COMING ELECTIONS;[6.] Q. Mr. President, in 1964 we asked you about backlash in the elections, and you correctly foresaw it wouldn't have any effect. Do you think it might be different this year in view of the problems in places like Chicago?;THE PRESIDENT. I think there are going to be a lot of the problems that exist in Chicago reflected in the elections, without any question. I think that the administration-Federal and State and city level--has to be constantly on the alert to do everything they can to face up to the modern-day problems and try to find solutions to them.;I see no evidence anywhere that there is any group that has a better answer to the problem than the one the administration has recommended from the Federal standpoint.;We have two parties in this country. I think that the administration program is pretty well known and, generally speaking, it is being supported by most of the members of our party and a substantial number of the members of the other party.;Now, there is really not anything else that I observe in competition to it. I don't know of any proposals that you would have to choose from where you would have an alternative to our recommendations.;I have pointed out how we would try to deal with the cities through our poverty program, through our urban renewal program, through our housing program, through our supplemental rents, through our demonstration cities, through our 20 educational programs and our 20 health programs, and so forth.;I believe from the information I get that most of the people of the country are willing to try those programs, improve them, and to help us work them out. I made a trip into five States this last weekend. I discussed pollution, demonstration cities, rural problems, Vietnam, and others. I found a very helpful attitude on the part of the people. I was very well received. And I think that the people generally approve of what we are trying to do.;THE PRESIDENT'S TRAVEL PLANS;[7.] Q. Mr. President, Governor Bellmon 3 of Oklahoma, to get back to politics for a minute, is described this morning in various dispatches as having wired you, advising you not to come into his State, on-his objection is against so-called nonpolitical trips in the political season. Is this sort of objection going to have any effect on your travel plans, or generally what do you think of this?;THE PRESIDENT. No, it is not going to have any effect.;3 Governor Henry Bellmon.;Q. Mr. President, are you going to west Texas to see the floods?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Q. Sir, what are your travel plans for this weekend?;THE PRESIDENT. I plan to leave Friday morning and go to Idaho, from Idaho to Denver, from Denver to Oklahoma, and go home late Friday evening. And I expect to be at home at the ranch Saturday and Sunday observing the results of 58 years of very pleasant existence.;USIA BIOGRAPHICAL FILM;[8.] Q. Mr. President, recently aboard the - Sequoia you showed a USIA film to a group of officials, which was a biographical film. When I called U.S. Information Agency, the spokesman there refused to give the routine information like the cost of production and the content of the film. My question is, sir: Has there been any instruction from the White House to keep this information under wraps, and if not, could you give us the cost and the content of the film?;THE PRESIDENT. No, there have been no instructions. And I do not have the information, although I am sure it is publicly available to the appropriate committees. I have seen a story on it that has been published. If you will get out the clipsheets, I will ask Mr. Moyers 4 to try to help you if you need that information.;4 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President.;Q. Can we ask USIA to give us the information?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I will give it to you if we have it available. I think it has been publicized. The USIA has made a number of films of that nature. I first knew of this film when I read it on the front page of the paper, so if you just read your papers I think you will have the information.;CIVIL RIGHTS DEMONSTRATIONS;[9.] Q. Mr. President, in view of the continuing violence in Chicago and the fears of more violence in Cicero this weekend, do you think that perhaps the civil rights demonstrations are becoming self-defeating and should be curtailed?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't have any comment on that in addition to what I said in Rhode Island the other day, and in New York the day before. I went into it rather fully, explained my viewpoint. And I would refer you to those statements.;POLL ON PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCES FOR 1968;[10.] Q. Mr. President, the Democrats would rather have Robert Kennedy as their 1968 presidential candidate than you, according to a recent poll of which I imagine you are aware, sir. But could you tell us, how do you explain this?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't have an explanation for it.;Q. Are you surprised, sir?;OUTLOOK FOR DEMOCRATS IN ELECTIONS;[II.] Q. Mr. President, a number of Democratic freshmen in Congress who came in in your election in 1964 have a lot of serious competition this year and there is a numbers game going on, of course, about how many seats the Democrats might lose and so forth.;Without playing a game, can you give us your assessment of the party's prospects in the congressional elections?;THE PRESIDENT. Since 1890, according to an article that I read the other day, from the Christian Science Monitor--it may be here now--there has been an average gain of 41 seats in off-year elections since 1890.;Now, I do not have the tabulation on each seat that will be up this year, and those that are marginal. But I do not have the feeling that there will be any substantial turnover in either the House or the Senate.;I have read the predictions made in the so-called numbers game that you refer to. Most of them come from the same old voices and the same old predictors that were predicting a substantial gain in 1964.;I have never seen them point to any specific district that they are going to take. I have been interested in having them point up where they are going to get 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 seats. They carefully stay away from that. The only test that we have really had that you could measure it by was in California in Congressman Baldwin's seat, the Republican that had held the seat for many years. He died and they had a special election.;That seat was taken by a Democrat. I think it would be unfair to assume because of that one instance the trend was toward the Democrats having captured a Republican seat? 5;5 Representative John F. Baldwin, Jr., a Republican, was elected in 1954 from the 14th Congressional District of California, which comprises Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay area. He died on March 9, 1966, and on June 7 the special election to fill his seat was won by Jerome R. Waldie, a Democrat.;But I do think you will find that there will be some seats like that that the Republicans lose and we will probably lose some. But I don't expect to see any unusual change from what you would expect normally in an election this year.;And I would be interested in anyone who would give me names and dates and specifics. I think that is an indication that they really don't believe what they are saying. I think in an election year 2 or 3 months before election you see a lot of people who try to create psychological situations and bandwagon approaches, and try to repeat a thing so many times that finally, folks begin to believe it. But the reports we get from the States that we visit, from the candidates that we talk to--we had a meeting of them recently--do not indicate that certainly there will be any change above the expected change in an off-year election.;Q. Would that mean 41 seats, sir? You cite the Christian Science Monitor. Would you accept that as a norm for this year?;THE PRESIDENT. No. No, I don't know of any. I would say the only election I know about is the California election. And if they can point up any others where they are going to take seats, I would be glad to. If I could, I would like to get you to point up that one.;THE OUTLOOK IN IOWA;Q. Mr. President, specifically on this same line, the Republicans have spoken very optimistically about those five freshman Democrats that you got from Iowa.;Do you have a reading on the Iowa situation?;THE PRESIDENT. There are five Democrats from Iowa, and I believe that all of them think that they will be reelected. I do not have any information to contradict that.;I had a very good reception in Iowa, and I have very good reports from Iowa. And there is not anything that I can see in the picture that would indicate that we are not going to have good results there.;AN ALL-ASIAN PEACE CONFERENCE;[12.] Q. Mr. President, I just wondered if you would accept an all-Asian conference as a way of trying to settle the Vietnam war.;THE PRESIDENT. We have given our views on an all-Asian conference. I would not have anything to add to that.;Q. Mr. President, in that connection, Mr. Nixon said we ought to withdraw our offer to go to a Geneva conference, because it is a dead end street, and would be unacceptable to Asian nations.;Would you comment on that suggestion?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I am willing to go to a conference anywhere, where I think it would be helpful. I am not going to black out any place, although I think that you understand our picture in the world and in Asia well enough to understand that we would be very pleased to see an all-Asian conference, although we do not want to make it appear that we are trying to direct it or force it.;We think that there is nothing to be gained by our urging it from the housetops. We have made it clear that we would look with favor upon it. And we think it would be desirable. But we are not trying to "hard sell" it because it could have an opposite effect.;PERMANENT" U.S. BASES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA;[13.] Q. Mr. President, on Vietnam, the point is sometimes made both by the Communists and some people in this country that the United States is building a lot of permanent-type bases in both Vietnam, and now Thailand.;Despite the fact that you have said that we don't want permanent bases out there, they don't seem to believe this and cite it as an obstacle in negotiation. Is there anything you could say to further clarify that point?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I can understand their doubt. I have made it as clear as I know how to make it, that we do not intend to maintain any bases in South Vietnam or Thailand, that we have no desire to keep our men there.;We are ready to stop the moment they are willing to stop. I have even asked that we give thought to planning how we could convert these bases to useful civilian purposes, and we are giving study to that now.;You can't make a man believe something that he does not want to believe. But I believe, and I know, that this Government and this country has no desire to have permanent bases in South Vietnam. And once they stop trying to gobble up their neighbor, and we can have an agreement there, we will make it just as clear as we have in the Dominican Republic that we will come home.;ASIAN VISIT BY GENERAL EISENHOWER;[14.] Q. Mr. President, there was a wire report yesterday saying that at White House invitation, General Eisenhower had been invited to tour Southeast Asia. The people in Gettysburg refer us to the White House. Do you have any comment on that, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I am not aware of-we have not extended the invitation. That is the answer. Someone said that when the General was in the hospital that he visited with a representative of Thailand who happened also to be in the hospital. That became an official report. And that was the source of your news. I cannot confirm that But I have not extended to General Eisenhower any specific invitation to visit Thailand or any other place.;I am always anxious to see General Eisenhower, and to talk to him, and to receive his suggestions. But the first I knew of the story was when I saw it published.;U.S. RELATIONS WITH CAMBODIA;[15.] Q. In that connection, what is this Government doing to improve relations with Cambodia?;THE PRESIDENT. We have made it clear that in due time representatives of our Senate would be glad to again visit Cambodia, as Senator Mansfield and his group did last year, in an attempt to have a better understanding with that country. We would be very pleased to have Ambassador Harriman visit Cambodia at a date agreeable to Cambodia, and to our Government, and to Mr. Harriman. 6;6 Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and U.S. Ambassador at Large W. Averell Harriman.;FEDERAL JUDGESHIP IN ILLINOIS;[16.] Q. Mr. President, Senator Douglas is up in arms over a report that Senator Dirksen 7 has been assured that the next Federal judgeship in Illinois will be filled on his recommendation. He threatens, if this is true, to invoke senatorial courtesy when the nomination comes up for confirmation. Could you perhaps clarify the matter by saying whether Senator Dirksen has received such a commitment?;THE PRESIDENT. I am not aware that Senator Douglas is up in arms, number one. Your report is the first information I have had. I am not aware of any commitment that has been made to either Senator in the matter.;7 Senators Paul H. Douglas and Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois.;THE VICE-PRESIDENCY IN 1968;[17.] Q. Mr. President, getting back to the question about Mr. Nixon, can you give us an assessment of the role of the Vice President, Mr. Humphrey, and whether, if you are a candidate in 1968, you would like to have him on the ticket with you again?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that all of you know what I know, that the Vice President is a fine and excellent public servant and I would not--I am talking about Vice President Humphrey--I would not be guided in my view about the performance of Vice President Humphrey by either the wishes or the desires or the predictions of an ex-Vice President.;NOMINATIONS AND APPOINTMENTS;AMBASSADOR TO SWITZERLAND;[18.] Q. Mr. President, do you have any State Department appointments in the works today?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I am sending to the Senate the nomination of John S. Hayes as Ambassador to Switzerland. Mr. Hayes is associated with the Washington Post Company, Post-Newsweek radio-television stations here and in Jacksonville, Florida.;We have just received the agreement on it. And I will sign the nomination papers later today. That is the only one that I have in mind. We have one or two agreements out that have not come in which will complete all the ambassadorial vacancies. And there are fewer there than there have ever been before.;We have a vacancy in the Mann job, which we have tentatively selected a successor for, but they will probably be announced after it is determined when Mr. Johnson 7a desires to--following his confirmation, after the Senate has acted, and when he desires to go to Tokyo. There will be several announcements there.;7a U. Alexis Johnson, nominated to be U.S. Ambassador to Japan. See also Item 474 [17].;We have only one vacancy at the moment. However, there will be three or four--the Mann vacancy and the Johnson vacancy, and other changes below the Secretary of State. When we can set those dates, which, I would suspect would be around in the fall sometime--I don't know when the Senate will act on the Johnson nomination, but it will be, I would guess, somewhere in the fall--we will make those announcements. 8;8 The President, in his news conference of September 21, announced appointments to fill the vacancies in question (see Item 474 [ 17]).;RISING INTEREST RATES;[19.] Q. Mr. President, is the administration going to do anything about rising interest rates?;THE PRESIDENT. The administration wants as low interest rates as we possible can have. We have made some recommendations to the Congress. The Senate Banking Committee now has a bill that would direct and give authority to certain Federal agencies to set ceilings on certain monetary matters. We very strongly favor that bill.;So far as the administration itself telling a banker or a loan man how much he can charge, as you no doubt know, it has no such authority.;Acting upon the advice of a former President and Secretary of the Treasury, we created the Federal Reserve System and it is an independent board that has charge of the discount rate and thereby has some influence on interest rates. But the President, as such, or the administration, as such, cannot mash a button and tell people to charge more or charge less.;We would hope that, as Secretary of the Treasury Fowler has said a number of times, that the bankers would be very discerning in their loan grants and not make loans when we have a greater demand for loans than we have a supply of money to people, unless the loan had a demonstrable public interest and to exercise discretion in those loans.;Now other than that, we have no authority to say that this ceiling shall be 4 percent, or 5 percent, or 6 percent. There is legislation pending that would have some effect upon it.;If Congress saw fit to give the administration legislation in this field, why we would, of course, carefully review it and try to carry out the terms of the law.;Merriman Smith, United Press International. Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks at the Swearing In of Nicholas deB. Katzenbach as Under Secretary of State.</td><td class="c6">October 3, 1966</td><td class="c7">Secretary and Mrs. Katzenbach and family, Justice White, Secretary Rusk, Members of the Cabinet, Members of the Congress, my friends;I am delighted to see so many friends and admirers of our new Under Secretary of State here in the White House with us this afternoon. The presence of so many friends from so many fields speaks well of the kind of man that we all know Nicholas Katzenbach to be.;A nation, like an individual, must earn the right to have its professions of idealism taken seriously. The tree must be judged by the fruit.;Thus we cannot escape the intimate connection between our domestic and our foreign policy.;When we claim to be sustaining the cause of freedom in the world, we are judged-and I think rightly so--in terms of our commitment to liberty and justice here at home.;As our new Under Secretary of State put it more than 5 years ago: "To be effective, a commitment to principle must be credible in terms of a nation's institutions, its values, and its character.;We Americans do not believe in moral double-bookkeeping--and so today we stand before the world asking only that others employ a similar, single standard of evaluation.;By such a standard, the appointment of Nicholas Katzenbach as the Under Secretary of State demonstrates that what we are at home demonstrates what we are abroad. He has stood here among us for the cause of freedom, he has pursued justice for every American. Every man is in his heart. Now the scope of his mark is the world, and the qualities of his mind and spirit which have made him the champion of social change and human progress here at home will now make him their advocate throughout the world.;Nick Katzenbach invoked the police power in the struggle for freedom for all Americans. Power was used--with somber reluctance--in defense of the rule of law.;We and our allies this afternoon--with equal reluctance--are employing police power in Vietnam. And for the same goal: to maintain the fundamental principles of international rule of law.;As author Nicholas Katzenbach wrote back in 1961;The legal institutions in the international community are not adequate to contemporary affairs. But these institutions, such as they are, exist and contribute to international order. They will continue until some political combination has the capability to create new institutions more consonant with order and... a decent regard for human values.;By this appointment--recommended to me by the distinguished Secretary of State--of a scholar-administrator with a lifelong dedication to finding the appropriate mixture of power and principle, the United States reaffirms its adherence to the rule of law in the world, as well as in the Nation.;It reaffirms its quest for that creativity in the international arena which will make the United Nations the instrument of world order, of world peace, and of world justice.;Finally, I might just add as a personal note that both President Kennedy and I have fearfully overworked Nick Katzenbach.;Although Assistant Attorney General, then Deputy Attorney General, and then Attorney General by title, he has for the past 6 years been one of the key participants in the inner councils of all the important decisions of the Presidency. In the Dominican crisis, in the Cuban crisis, in the Berlin crisis, Nick Katzenbach was available and he was called upon for his views and for his judgments.;And those who have profited from his counsel, as I have, will realize that as Under Secretary of State our country is gaining a talented, creative administrator who is not really changing jobs, but merely rechanneling his creativity.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">October 6, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.;PERSONNEL CHANGES IN THE EXECUTIVE;BRANCH;[1.] I intend to nominate Mr. Llewellyn Thompson to be the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Because of the importance of our relations with the Soviet Union at this time, I am asking Mr. Thompson to return to a post that he has held already, and that he served for a longer period of time than any American Ambassador in this Nation's history.;To succeed him as Ambassador at Large, I will appoint one of our most distinguished and experienced diplomats, Mr. Ellsworth Bunker, who served us with such great distinction in the Dominican Republic and who is presently Ambassador to the Organization of American States.;To serve as my representative to the Organization of American States with the rank of Ambassador, I intend to nominate Mr. Sol M. Linowitz, the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer of Xerox International, Inc.;Mr. Linowitz is a noted American with a long interest in foreign policy. He will also serve as United States Representative on the Inter-American Committee on the Alliance for Progress, replacing Mr. Rostow. 1;1 Walt W. Rostow, Special Assistant to the President.;He will work closely with Secretary Rusk and Secretary Gordon, 2 and with me in the formulation of our Latin American policies.;2 Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, and Lincoln Gordon, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs and U.S. Coordinator, Alliance for Progress.;I have accepted today with great regret the resignation of Eugene P. Foley as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development. Mr. Foley is returning to private life and will be succeeded by Mr. Ross D. Davis. Mr. Davis is presently the Administrator of the Economic Development Administration.;MANILA CONFERENCE;[2.] As you know, the United States has agreed to attend the conference in Manila on October 24th and 25th. This will bring together the countries that are most directly helping the South Vietnamese to resist aggression and to build a free nation.;The Philippines, Korea, and Thailand extended the invitation which has been accepted now by South Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.;The details of the meeting--including the agenda--are now being worked out in consultation among all the participants. President Marcos of the Philippines has already indicated the scope of the conference, and we expect;--to review the military progress being made in the field;--to hear the South Vietnamese plans for further evolution toward representative government, accelerated security of the countryside, and a strengthened economy while curbing inflation;--to examine how the other nations present can best support all these efforts, and;--to explore the prospects for peaceful settlement of the Vietnamese conflict, in the light of all the proposals.;Much of this effort is consistent with the work at Honolulu in February which I considered highly successful. At that meeting the Government of South Vietnam reinforced its determination;--to move toward a democratic constitution and an elected government;--to take concrete steps to combat inflation;--to invite Vietcong to join them through the Open Arms program, and;--to multiply efforts in health, education, and agriculture, especially in the countryside.;Each of these steps, as you know., has produced results since our meeting in Honolulu in February. And we are very hopeful that they will receive increased support in our discussions in Manila.;Once aggression has been defeated, a common dedication will also be necessary for the rehabilitation and the development of Vietnam.;Finally, I have agreed to speak to the National Conference of Editorial Writers in New York City tomorrow on our European policy.;Now I will be glad to take any questions that you may have to ask.;QUESTIONS;GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES IN THE SOUTH;[3.] Q. As titular head of the Democratic Party, how do you feel about the candidacy, the gubernatorial candidacy, of several Democrats in the South who are avowed segregationists?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it is very evident that some of these candidates to whom you refer differ with certain of my policies that deal with equal rights and equal treatment for all of our citizens.;These gubernatorial candidates that you refer to have not asked me to support them and I have no plans to do so. I doubt that the President should get into every race in every State.;VISIT TO VIETNAM?;[4.] Q. Mr. President, is there any possibility you might visit South Vietnam while you are in the Far East?;THE PRESIDENT. No consideration has been given at this time to any such program or any such visit.;OUTLOOK FOR PEACE;[5.] Q. Mr. President, can you tell us if events of the past few days, including your order to stop bombing part of the DMZ, have moved us any closer to peace?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I think Mr. Moyers 3 covered that in his press conference yesterday. We are, of course, hopeful that any action we could take would be reciprocated and would lead in that direction. But there is nothing that I could say that would be encouraging to you along that line as a result of that action.;3 Bill D. Moyers, Special Assistant to the President;CAMPAIGN ISSUES;[6.] Q. Mr. President, a lot of observers are observing that apprehension over the economy and the so-called race question are far outdistancing Vietnam as issues in this political campaign.;What is your assessment of these and other issues and would you assess for us not your administration's, but the Republican opposition's handling of these issues?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that every person will draw his own conclusions about the section of the country he is in and the local issues that may exist. I have no doubt but what our full employment program, our Vietnam engagement, our domestic problems--including our civil rights problems-will all play a part in some of the campaigns. I think it will differ from place to place and candidate to candidate.;I think the 89th Congress, which is made up of both Democrats and Republicans, but predominantly Democrats, has been a very effective and productive Congress in the field of education. It has passed 18 far-reaching educational measures, 24 health measures. It has passed more educational measures-this Congress--than all the other 88 Congresses combined. I believe that most of the Members of that Congress will return home with a very fine record to support them. And I think that most of them will be reelected.;THE STOCK MARKET;[7.] Q. Mr. President, the stock market today reached its low for the year. I wonder if you could give us your reaction to the rather steady decline of the market in recent months?;THE PRESIDENT. I think a good many things have a bearing on market fluctuations. I think the high interest rates, I think the attractiveness of other securities, I think some of the uncertainties that exist concerning how much money the Government itself will be spending next year, I think the questions of doubt about our tax policy--all of those are given weight, too. But I think most of the people in this country feel like 1966 has been a very good year. There has never been a better one. And I believe that 1967 will be equally as good.;RESUMPTION OF AID TO INDONESIA;[8.] Q. Mr. President, the United States has recently resumed its assistance to Indonesia. Would you tell us what your considerations were in taking this action?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. We think the leaders of that country are doing their best to build a stable government. We think that is very important to the people of this world. We felt ourselves in a position to be helpful. The need was great. We carefully evaluated the requests and decided it would be in the best interests of our own people, as well as the people of Indonesia, to extend the assistance we did. I am glad that we have taken that action.;THE DEMONSTRATION CITIES BILL;[9.] Q. Mr. President, sir, Monday the House is scheduled to vote on the demonstration cities bill. Title II of that bill, which you are urging Members, I understand, to vote for, provides incentives or, rather, bribes to local communities to do away with their own school systems, to have open housing, and to create educational parks where there would be 25,000 or 35,000 children going to school. This would require busing of children long distances and would also bring about a system to correct racial imbalance.;Now you are a former schoolteacher. I wonder if you would tell us why you think doing away with the local school systems, as has been admitted by educators in your administration would happen--I wonder why you think this would be better?;THE PRESIDENT. First, I would not concur with your legal analysis of the bill. Second, I am glad of the opportunity that you have given me to state that I believe there is no domestic problem that is more critical than the problem of rebuilding our cities and giving our people who live in the cities opportunities to develop as healthy, educated, productive citizens of our society-citizens who have the ability to get and to hold jobs, and to take pride in the place in which they live.;In order to try to get at the root cause of the problems of the cities, I asked a task force of bipartisan leaders of this Nation to make a careful study of this measure. Their recommendations are contained in the demonstration cities bill.;Hearings have already been held. The Senate carefully and thoroughly debated the measure and passed it by an overwhelming majority. I do not think they gave to it either the interpretation that you place upon it or the fears that you express.;I do hope that the House will take prompt and favorable action early next week.;As I said in the beginning, and as I would repeat again, I think it is one of the most important pieces of legislation for the good of all American mankind that we can act upon this session. 4;4 The demonstration cities bill was approved by the President on November 3, 1966 (see Item 574).;EFFECT OF VIETNAM SPENDING ON GREAT;SOCIETY PROGRAMS;[10.] Q. Mr. President, some of your political opposition is saying that the Great Society is suffering badly because of preoccupation with and spending for Vietnam. What is your reaction to that?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the record speaks for itself. We have recommended approximately 90 bills to this session of Congress, after having the most productive session, the last session, in our history.;We have passed through both Houses about 75 of those 90 bills. I would suspect in the next 10 days we can pass another 10. When you pass 85 bills out of 90 recommended, I think that is a pretty good box score.;We passed two measures through the House that had a majority for them in the Senate, but we could not get them voted on-14(b) and the civil rights bill.;We regret that, but there will be other days, and I am sure that in due time a majority will prevail. I think all in all we have a very outstanding record this year. I am very proud of it. I think every Member of Congress of both parties can take pride in it.;THE PACIFIC--ASIAN TOUR;[11.] Q. Mr. President, some of your critics also are saying that your trip is motivated largely by political considerations. Would you comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't think so. I just think you'd have to evaluate the critics and judge the circumstances and draw your own conclusions. And I wouldn't want anyway to spend all afternoon talking about my critics.;RESPECT FOR LAW AND ORDER;[12.] Q. Mr. President, the Republican Coordinating Committee, including President Eisenhower, recently said that public order, that is, both crime in the streets and riots, was a problem of greatest concern to the people of this country.;They also charged that the Johnson-Humphrey administration has done nothing of substance to date to deal with this problem. I think that is the way they said it.;I wonder if you could answer this charge and, two, if you could assess what you think conditions are in this country concerning public order?;THE PRESIDENT. As I have said in Rhode Island, Indianapolis, and before the Methodist bishops in the White House last week, every citizen in this land must be concerned with law and order. The voice of reason must drown out the voice of violence.;We have had very serious problems because of the conditions in our cities, the problems that exist there, and the protests made by our citizens.;I hope that we can keep violence out of the picture. I have done everything that I know how, in cooperation with the mayors, the chief executives of the cities, and the chief executives of the States concerned.;We are very conscious of the problem. We are very concerned about it. We are very determined to do everything within our prerogatives to see that reason prevails over violence, and that law and order always prevails.;We think that the protesters themselves have the most to lose by disapproval of some of the actions that have taken place. And while we are not oblivious to the problems that bring forth the protests, we are concerned that they be protests without violence and within law and within order.;THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIELD;[13.] Q. Mr. President, sir, in a broader context on civil rights, there seems to be a dispute developing between those who feel that the Federal Government should merely strike down legal barriers to equality and those who feel that the Government should play a more positive role in encouraging integration in various facets of life.;I wonder if we could get your thinking on these two and where you stand on that argument?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I think the Federal Government must be a leader in this field and I have--the 3 years I have been President-tried, by word and action, to do everything I could to bring about equality among the races in this country and to see that the Brown decision affecting the integration of our schools was carried forward expeditiously and in accordance with the law--to see that the civil rights acts passed in the late fifties and sixties and more recently in my administration were carried out in accordance with the intent of Congress, that the law was fully adhered to and fully enforced at all times.;I realize that in some instances there has been some harassment, some mistakes perhaps have been made, some people have been enthusiastic, and differences have developed.;But where those mistakes have been made, I think Mr. Gardner and the Commissioner of Education 5 have been willing to always listen to any protests that might come, and to carry out the law as Congress intended it should be.;5 John W. Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and Harold Howe II, Commissioner of Education, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.;That will be the policy of our administration: to continue to promote and to expedite the observance of the law of the land, and to see that all citizens of this country are treated equally without discrimination.;VIETNAM;[14.] Q. Former President Eisenhower has said that we should use whatever is necessary, not excluding nuclear weapons, to end the fighting in Vietnam. What do you think of such a proposal?;THE PRESIDENT. Without passing on the accuracy of your quotation of President Eisenhower, I would say it is the policy of this Government to exercise the best judgment of which we are capable in an attempt to provide the maximum deterrence with a minimum involvement. The easiest thing we could do is get in a larger war with other nations.;We are constantly concerned with the dangers of that. At the same time, we have no desire to capitulate or to retreat. So it has been the policy of your present administration to provide the strength that General Westmoreland felt was necessary: to prevent the aggressor from succeeding without attempting to either conquer or to invade or to destroy North Vietnam.;Our purpose is a limited one and that is to permit self-determination for the people of South Vietnam. We are going to be concerned with any effort that might take on more far-reaching objectives or implications.;THE MANILA CONFERENCE;[15.] Q. Mr. President, do you have any plans to take along a bipartisan congressional delegation to Manila?;THE PRESIDENT. We have not gone into that in any detail at this time. If any plans develop along that line I will announce them and give you information on them. I have nothing on it now.;OUTLOOK FOR PEACE;[16.] Q. Mr. President, the Vietcong has recently modified two of its preconditions for peace, namely, they no longer seem to be demanding that we withdraw before negotiations and they no longer seem to be asking that they be the sole representatives of the South Vietnamese people.;Do you feel these changes have brought any significant contribution toward peace?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I have not seen any developments in the recent weeks that would cause me to hold out hope or to give you any real justification for encouragement.;We pursue every indication that we have that might offer any possibilities. We always have an open mind. And we are very anxious to find any basis for negotiation that would lead to an honorable peace. But I cannot in frankness be encouraging to you as a result of any specific action of recent weeks.;THE PACIFIC-ASIA-TOUR;[17.] Q. Mr. President, could you tell us your hopes of what the results will be of this extensive tour of the Pacific and Asia that you are going to undertake later this month?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not want to get your hopes up and have you disappointed because we didn't achieve everything that I would like to see achieved.;I have a great many objectives and hopes for the people of that area of the world. Two-thirds of humankind lives in Asia. And we all know, I think, that their problems are very serious. Their life expectancy is very short, comparatively speaking. Their per capita income is very low.;In Vietnam now we have the march of the aggressor's heel stomping on the boundaries of freedom-loving people.;We have the problems of men being killed there every day in an attempt to establish their right to self-determination.;So I would hope that those nations who are committed against aggression in South Vietnam could have a complete review of the military effort being made, and the results of that effort, together with any analysis that our leaders might care to make.;I would think the political and the economic problems of that area of the world would also be a very important subject for discussion.;I think that we should thoroughly explore each leader's ideas about how an honorable peace can be reached, and what course reconstruction efforts following the peace could very properly take, and how we could participate in those efforts.;I would expect, if afforded the opportunity, to be called upon to review some of our thoughts about reconstruction, about the developments resulting from the elections in South Vietnam, and the political developments to be expected there.;I think generally speaking it will give an opportunity for the leaders of the men who are committed to battle in Vietnam to meet and explore ways of finding peace, for bringing an end to the conflict, for making that area of the world prosperous and peaceful in the years to come.;The invitation, as you know, was extended by other countries. I am sure that they will have some specific plans to suggest.;I want to be a good listener as well as an active participant.;MRS. JOHNSON'S PLANS FOR THE TOUR;[18.] I neglected to mention that Mrs. Johnson will accompany me on my trip. She will join me in most of my official schedule. During the conferences, as time permits, she will visit various projects and historic sites to gather ideas for use by her National Committee for a More Beautiful Capital and similar civic groups throughout the country.;THE ITINERARY FOR THE TOUR;[19.] Q. Will you give us your itinerary, please?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that will be available for you at the door. We will leave Washington October 17th. We will return via Alaska, arriving here sometime in the early part of November, November 2d or 3d.;Our first stop will be Honolulu. We will go nonstop from Washington to Honolulu. We will have some refueling stops en route, but our next stop will be New Zealand.;As you know--and this has been announced several times since I became President--I have wanted very much to return to the scenes of my "young-man days" and go back to New Zealand and Australia where I spent some time in the early forties. So I will be visiting New Zealand on October 19th for 2 days, Australia, October 21st and 22d, Manila for the conference the 23d through the 27th, Thailand from October 27th through the 30th, Malaysia, October 30th and 31st, Korea, October 31st through November 2d, and then we will return to the United States.;TAX INCREASE;[20.] Q. Mr. President, at one of your recent meetings with the Governors, sir, Governor Scranton 6 emerged and indicated that he felt you would have to ask for a tax increase next year. Could you give us your assessment of that situation now?;THE PRESIDENT. I can't add anything to the statements that I made in my message to Congress. I have succinctly summarized it. The situation today is the same as then. We are waiting to know how much the Congress will let us spend this coming fiscal year.;6 Governor William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania.;There are 8 of the 15 appropriation bills that have not yet passed. Until they pass, we do not know what the bill will be. You can't reduce a bill that you haven't received. As soon as they are passed, we will immediately review those bills, determine how much they can be reduced, and then make a calculation of our revenue.;In the meantime, I am asking Secretary McNamara to make a careful review of our proposed expenditures--first, the expenditures that have already taken place for the first quarter from June through September. He will be visiting with Admiral Sharp 7 in Honolulu. He will leave Saturday night for a visit with General Westmoreland.;7 Adm. U. S. Grant Sharp, Jr., Commander of U.S. Forces in the Pacific.;I hope by the time that he gets back the Congress will have sent me some of these measures so we can determine how much we can spend, what our revenues will be, what the Vietnam supplemental will be. Then we will try to make recommendations that will see that our provision is made for revenue to meet whatever deficits we have, if that is possible. I think that we cannot do this until we receive these bills and these estimates.;We all should bear in mind, however, when the Congress votes add-ons to the remaining eight bills, it must be borne in mind that each vote to increase is likely to be a vote to increase the revenue later.;I will be specific with you just as soon as those bills get here and we analyze them. We hope we would be able to analyze them so that by the time I would have to act on them I could get some rough estimates.;I am going to take whatever action is necessary to see that we have a sound fiscal policy. But I can't take that action until the appropriation bills are voted upon and it is determined.;For instance, yesterday in the Senate the committee reported a bill that provided three-fourths of a billion dollars more than the Senate ultimately voted. So if we had calculated before the vote was taken, we would have been $750 million off.;We will take prompt action as soon as the Congress makes its recommendations and as soon as I can ascertain from the military what their best guess is as to the expenditures for the immediate future.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks in New York City Before the National Conference of Editorial Writers.</td><td class="c6">October 7, 1966</td><td class="c7">Mr. Clendinen, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Ambassador, members of the Conference of Editorial Writers, ladies and gentlemen;I am a little baffled by this room. It makes a speaker have to talk out of both sides of his mouth.;Since the Secretary took you on a quick trip around the world, I hope you will pardon me if I just ask you to go across the Atlantic with me.;I remember some years ago President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed the Daughters of the American Revolution. His opening words were not his usual, "My friends," but instead he said, "My fellow immigrants.;And he was right, because most of our fathers came from Europe--east or west, north or south. They settled in London, Kentucky, Paris, Idaho, and Rome, New York. Chicago, with Warsaw, is one of the great Polish cities of the world. And New York is the second capital of half the nations of Europe. That really is the story of our country.;Americans and all Europeans share a connection which transcends political differences. We are a single civilization, we share a common destiny, our future is a common challenge.;Today two anniversaries especially remind us of the interdependence of Europe and America.;--On September 30, 17 years ago, the Berlin airlift ended.;--On October 7, just 3 years ago, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was ratified.;There is a healthy balance here. It is no accident. It reflects the balance the Atlantic allies have always tried to maintain between strength and conciliation, between firmness and flexibility, between resolution and hope.;The Berlin airlift was an act of measured firmness. Without that firmness, the Marshall plan and the recovery of Western Europe, of course, would have been impossible.;That hopeful and progressive achievement, the European Economic Community, would never have been born.;The winds of change which are blowing in Eastern Europe would not have been felt here today.;All these are the fruits of our determination.;The Test Ban Treaty is the fruit of our hope. With more than 100 other cosigners we have committed ourselves to advance from deterrence through terror toward a more cooperative international order. We must go forward to banish all nuclear weapons-and to banish war itself.;So a just peace remains our most important goal. But we know that the world is changing. Our policy must reflect the reality of today--not yesterday. In every part of the world new forces are standing at the gates: new countries, new aspirations, new men. In this spirit let us look ahead to the tasks that confront us today in the Atlantic nations, as I will look ahead a little later to the tasks that confront us in another part of the world as I travel 25,000 miles in the Pacific area.;Europe has been at peace since 1945. But it is a restless peace that's shadowed by the threat of violence.;Europe is partitioned. An unnatural line runs through the heart of a very great and a very proud nation. History warns us that until this harsh division has been resolved, peace in Europe will never be secure.;We must turn to one of the great unfinished tasks of our generation--and that unfinished task is making Europe whole again.;Our purpose is not to overturn other governments, but to help the people of Europe to achieve together;--a continent in which the peoples of Eastern and Western Europe work shoulder to shoulder together for the common good;--a continent in which alliances do not confront each other in bitter hostility, but instead provide a framework in which West and East can act together in order to assure the security of all.;In a restored Europe, Germany can and will be united.;This remains a vital purpose of American policy. And we reiterated it and reaffirmed it to Chancellor Erhard just a few days ago. It can only be accomplished through a growing reconciliation, because there is no shortcut.;We must move ahead on three fronts;--First, to modernize NATO and strengthen other Atlantic alliances.;--Second, to further the integration of the Western European community.;--Third, to quicken progress in East-West relations. Now may I speak to each of these in turn.;I.;Our first concern is to keep NATO strong, and to keep it modern and to keep it abreast of the times in which we live.;The Atlantic Alliance has already proved its vitality. Together, we have faced the threats of peace which have confronted us-and we shall meet those which may confront us in the future.;Let no one doubt ever for a moment the American commitment. We shall not ever unlearn the lesson of the thirties, when isolation and withdrawal were our share in the common disaster.;We are committed, and we are committed to remain firm.;But the Atlantic Alliance is a living organism. It must adapt itself to the changing conditions.;Much is already being done to modernize its structures;--we are streamlining NATO command arrangements;--we are moving to establish a permanent nuclear planning committee;--we are increasing the speed and certainty of supply across the Atlantic.;However, there is much more that we can do.;There is much more that we must do. The Alliance must become a forum, a forum for increasingly close consultations. These should cover the full range of joint concerns--from East-West relations to crisis management.;The Atlantic Alliance is the central instrument of the entire Atlantic community. But it is not the only one. Through other institutions, the nations of the Atlantic are now hard at work on constructive enterprise.;In the Kennedy Round we are negotiating with the other free world nations to reduce tariffs everywhere. Our goal is to free the trade of the world, to free it from arbitrary and artificial restraints.;We are engaged on the problem of international monetary reform.;We are exploring how best to develop science and technology as a common resource. Recently the Italian Government has suggested an approach to narrowing the gap in technology between the United States and Western Europe. That proposal, we think, deserves very careful study and consideration. The United States stands ready to cooperate with all of the European nations on all aspects of this problem.;Last--and perhaps really most important-we are working together to accelerate the growth of the developing nations. It is our common business to help the millions in these developing nations improve their standards of life, to increase their life expectancy, to increase their per capita income, to improve their health, their minds, their bodies, to, in turn, help them really fight and ultimately conquer the ancient enemies of mankind: hunger, illiteracy, ignorance, and disease. The rich nations can never live as an island of plenty in a sea of poverty.;Thus, while the institutions of the Atlantic community are growing, so are the tasks that confront us multiplying.;II.;Second among our tasks is the vigorous pursuit of further unity in the West.;To pursue that unity is neither to postpone nor to neglect for a moment our continuous search for peace in the world. There are good reasons for this.;--A united Western Europe can be our equal partner in helping to build a peaceful and just world order;--a united Western Europe can move more confidently in peaceful initiatives toward the East;--unity can provide a framework within which a unified Germany can be a full partner without arousing fears.;We look forward to the expansion and to the further strengthening of the European community. Of course, we realize that the obstacles are great. But perseverance has already reaped larger rewards than many of us dared hope for only a few years ago.;The outlines of the new Europe are clearly discernible. It is a stronger, it is an increasingly united but open Europe--with Great Britain a part of it--and with close ties to America.;III.;Finally, thirdly, one great goal of a united West is to heal the wound in Europe which now cuts East from West and brother from brother.;That division must be healed peacefully. It must be healed with the consent of Eastern European countries and consent of the Soviet Union. This will happen only as East and West succeed--succeed in building a surer foundation of mutual trust.;Nothing is more important than peace. We must improve the East-West environment in order to achieve the unification of Germany in the context of a larger, peaceful, and prosperous Europe.;Our task is to achieve a reconciliation with the East--a shift from the narrow concept of coexistence to the broader vision of peaceful engagement.;And I pledge to you today that Americans now stand ready to do their part.;Under the last four Presidents, our policy toward the Soviet Union has been the same. Where necessary, we shall defend freedom, where possible, we shall work with the East to build a lasting peace.;We do not intend to let our differences on Vietnam or elsewhere ever prevent us from exploring all opportunities. We want the Soviet Union and the nations of Eastern Europe to know that we and our allies shall go step by step with them just as far as they are willing to advance.;So let us--both Americans and Europeans-intensify, accelerate, strengthen our determined efforts.;We seek healthy economic and cultural relations with the Communist states.;--I am asking for early congressional action on the United States-Soviet Consular Agreement.;--We have just signed a new United States-Soviet Cultural Agreement.;--We intend to press for legislative authority to negotiate trade agreements which could extend most-favored-nation tariff treatment to European Communist states.;--We have just concluded an air agreement with the Soviet Union.;Today I am announcing the following new steps;--We will reduce export controls on East-West trade with respect to hundreds of nonstrategic items;--I have just today signed a determination that will allow the Export-Import Bank to guarantee commercial credits to four additional Eastern European countries-Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia. This is good business. And it will help us--it will help us to build the bridges to Eastern Europe that I spoke of in my address at VMI only a few months ago.;--The Secretary of State is now reviewing the possibility of easing the burden of Polish debts to the United States through expenditures of our Polish currency holdings which would be, we think, mutually beneficial to both countries.;--The Export-Import Bank is prepared to finance American exports for the Soviet-Italian Fiat auto plant.;--We are negotiating a civil air agreement with the Soviet Union, which I referred to. This will, we think, greatly facilitate tourism in both directions.;--This summer the American Government took additional steps to liberalize travel to Communist countries in Europe and in Asia. We intend to liberalize these rules still further in an attempt to promote better understanding and increased exchanges.;--In these past weeks, the Soviet Union and the United States have begun to exchange cloud photographs that are taken from the weather satellites.;You can see in these and many other ways the ties with the East will be strengthened-by the United States and by other Atlantic nations.;Agreement on a broad policy to this end, therefore, should be sought in existing Atlantic organs.;The principles which should govern East-West relations are now being discussed in the North Atlantic Council.;The OECD can also play an important part in trade and in contacts with the East. The Western nations can there explore the ways of inviting the Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries to cooperate in tasks of common interest and common benefit.;Hand-in-hand with these steps to increase East-West ties must go measures to remove territorial and border disputes as a source of friction in Europe. The Atlantic nations oppose the use of force to change existing frontiers. That is a bedrock, too, of our American foreign policy. We respect the integrity of a nation's boundary lines.;The maintenance of old enmities is not really in anyone's interest. Our aim is a true European reconciliation. We so much want to make this clear to the East.;Further, it is our policy to avoid the spread of national nuclear programs--in Europe and elsewhere in the world.;That is why we shall persevere in efforts to try to reach an agreement banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons.;We seek a stable military situation in Europe--one in which we hope that tensions can be lowered.;To this end, the United States will continue to play its part in effective Western deterrence. To weaken that deterrence might now create temptations and could endanger peace.;The Atlantic allies will, of course, continue together to study what strength NATO needs, in light of the changing technology and the current threat.;Reduction of Soviet forces in central Europe would, of course, affect the extent of that threat.;If changing circumstances should lead to a gradual and balanced revision in force levels on both sides, the revision could--together with the other steps that I have mentioned-help gradually to shape an entire new political environment.;The building of true peace and reconciliation in Europe, of course, will be a very long process.;The bonds between the United States and its Atlantic partners provide the strength, though, on which the entire security of this world depends. Our interdependence, therefore, is complete.;Our goal, in Europe and elsewhere, is, first of all--always--a just and a secure peace. It can most surely be achieved by common action. To this end, I pledge my country's best efforts;--best efforts to achieve new thrust for the Alliance;--to support movement toward Western European unity;--to bring about a far-reaching improvement in relations between the East and the West.;Our object is to end the bitter legacy of World War II. Let all of those who wish us well, and all others also, know that our guard will be up but our hand will always be out.;The American people love peace and they hate war. We do not believe that might makes right. So in pursuit of peace, history is aware of our commitments--the Marshall plan, the Truman doctrine, and to NATO and to SEATO. We have been tested in Berlin and in Korea, and in the Dominican Republic, and our brave men are being tested at this hour in Vietnam.;In every instance, our purpose has been peace, never war. Self-determination instead of selfish aggression. We believe that moral agreements are much to be preferred to military means. The conference table instead of the battlefield. But Americans will never close their eyes to reality. We back our word with dedication, and we also back it with the united resolve of a patient, of a determined, of a freedom-loving and a peaceful people. Together we shall never fail.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference in New York City</td><td class="c6">October 13, 1966</td><td class="c7">[Prince Souvanna Phouma, Prime Minister of Laos, participated in the news conference.];THE PRESIDENT. [1.] I thought I would give you a fill-in before you had to leave. The Prime Minister and I met at 9:30 and we will continue with our discussion into the next hour. We have been here about 50 minutes but they told me that some of you would need to have portions of our discussion as soon as possible because of travel arrangements and your deadline this afternoon.;The Prime Minister will be glad to summarize very briefly his viewpoint on the matter and I will do likewise. I won't give you any extended remarks about it but if you will be decent about it I will be glad to answer any questions.;Q. Would you give us the substance of your conversation?;THE PRESIDENT. The Prime Minister will give you a brief statement and review whatever he may choose to say.;THE PRIME MINISTER'S STATEMENT;[2.] THE PRESIDENT. I am deeply honored to have been received today by President Johnson. This is our first meeting since President Johnson became President. I had had the honor to meet with him when he was here on the occasion of the state visit of His Majesty the King of Laos to the United States.;Reviewing our conversation, we have exchanged a number of viewpoints on the situation in Southeast Asia. Our conversation has been extremely cordial and I am very happy to note that President Johnson is very fully informed about what goes on in Indochina and what goes on in my own country.;Together we have tried to find possibilities to bring peace back to that part of the world. I believe personally that the settlement of the present problem cannot be brought about by force of arms and that we must come as soon as possible to a conference, international in character, along the lines of the Geneva Conference of 1954, perhaps with a much broader membership.;We have also discussed the recent tragedy we have sustained in Laos with the floods of the Mekong River and the great devastation it has brought to the country.;I am happy to hear that the Government of the United States is ready to assist us in recovering from the damage of the destruction.;I should now like to leave it to the President to give you any additional firsthand information.;THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT;[3.] THE PRESIDENT. My part of the discussion consisted of expressing regret that I did not get to see the Premier last year when we had a tentative arrangement to meet. Because of my illness I had to forgo that pleasure.;Second, I asked him for a rather full report on the flood damage as a result of the Mekong disasters. He went into some detail of the loss of life--something in excess of 100--and the loss of values of the crops-something in excess of $5 million. It was the worst flood disaster in 40 years in that country. I asked for his views on how he thought we could achieve peace in Southeast Asia and he is in the process of giving me his views at some length in the light of what is taking place there.;He has discussed the general picture in Indochina--that whole part of the world. I emphasized to the Premier the desire for the people of the United States to have a positive, affirmative policy. We do not seek to conquer anyone. We are not bent on conquest. We do not want to dominate any people. We have no desire for any American presence in that area any longer than is necessary to resist aggression. We have no desire to maintain any bases. We have stated and restated and restated our desire to transfer the activity from the battlefield to the conference table.;I reviewed generally our objectives and our hopes for the Manila Conference and asked for his views on any suggestion he might have that he would wish me to consider. I pointed out to him that it must be obvious to the aggressors that they cannot succeed. And it must be equally obvious that we have no desire and no intention to impose our will upon their people or to change their form of government or even their way of life, but that Ho Chi Minh and the people of Hanoi have absolute, complete, and full responsibility for carrying on the war every day that it is carried on, that we were willing to stop yesterday and go to the peace table.;I further pointed out that we hope that all the nations of the world will realize this and all of this country realize it.;I told him that those who desire peace in the world do not need to exercise any influence on us to get us to have unconditional discussion. So if they can divert their talents and energies to the aggressors and Mr. Ho Chi Minh--if they have any influence with him, maybe they can contribute to advancing the cause of peace to which all of the American people have so fully dedicated themselves.;The fact that we love peace and hate war doesn't mean for a moment that we are going to break our commitments or retreat in the face of aggression. We think the world must know that aggression will not succeed in Indochina, in that area of the world, and that it is not our desire or our intent to impose our political views on any people.;It is in the interest of every American family that aggression not succeed, that the United States' word be kept, that our commitments be fulfilled, and that the people of the world not misinterpret the raucous and rasping voices in various quarters as indicating (a) either we want to dominate the area or (b) that we will get tired.;As in the Dominican Republic, we are not going to let might make right and let the aggressor impose his will on liberty-loving people. But as soon as the people have a right to self-determination and they make that determination under a supervised election or honest, proper procedures, we will act promptly in accordance with our statements. I have assured the Premier we have no desire to expand the conflict in Vietnam. We hope to work positively with all nations toward stability in Southeast Asia.;I summarized briefly my hopes in the seven-nation conference coming up. I pointed out to the Premier that I welcomed his visit and this opportunity to talk with him. In the last several weeks I have been busily engaged with reviewing with all of the leaders in that area: President Park of Korea, representatives of Malaysia, representatives of Burma, Ne Win, President Marcos, Prime Minister Holt, Prime Minister Holyoake. I discussed these problems at some length with the Prime Minister of India and with the President of Pakistan. Most of these people have come to Washington and most of them have come in very recent days. I have a general view of their attitude and their hopes and there is no substantial disagreement among us.;So far as the desire for peace is concerned, we believe that the peoples involved should be allowed to determine for themselves the type of government they should have.;I think we discussed some other technical, detailed problems about aid from other countries and about other matters affecting the internal affairs of this Government. But that is about the complete summary.;I think I will take any questions you may have.;QUESTIONS;[4.] Q. Mr. President, did the Prime Minister describe to you how serious he regards the Pathet Lao threat now?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Any other questions?;[5.] Q. Mr. President, was there any suggestion of expanding the Manila Conference by bringing the neutralist countries in?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;[6.] Q. Mr. President, did the Prime Minister suggest or ask for another bombing pause in North Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;[7.] Q. Mr. President, do I understand an indication that you suggested that he use some influence on Ho Chi Minh?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I said that we would invite that from all peoples everywhere, that we have made our case very clear and that none of you--and I say speaking of "you," the three billion people of the world--need have any doubt about this country's desire to go from the battlefield to the conference table.;Now the question is to produce the other party. I just stated that as a policy of this Government. We invite peaceful efforts in that direction from any and all.;[8.] Q. Mr. President, did you receive any invitation to visit Laos?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Q. Mr. President, did you discuss the military situation in Laos, the Ho Chi Minh Trail?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Q. Did you discuss the internal political situation in Laos?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;You might add that we have met with the representatives of that Thai Government, the Deputy Prime Minister and others from the Australian Government in recent days.;George 1 will give you the names and a list as soon as we get back to Washington.;1 George Christian, an assistant press secretary.;Q. Mr. President, are these all in preparation for the Manila Conference?;THE PRESIDENT. No, they are all a part of the general search for peace and the study of the situation in the area which would be very useful. But the visits were not scheduled because of it. Some of them have taken place before we were invited. Some of them have been taking place after. As I have said to you we are glad to attend the conference. It is a problem for us.;We prefer to go in the middle of November after the Congress is out and after we have our problems adjusted here at home, but they have an election there November 26 and they just couldn't come. Of course, we have a problem of accepting because we always have some of you that can find something questionable about doing it. But think about the problem we would have if we had refused--probably from the same sources.;Reporter: Thank you.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference in Washington on His Return From the Columbus Day Trip</td><td class="c6">October 13, 1966</td><td class="c7">OPENING STATEMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS;THE PRESIDENT. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to the White House.;THE SOUTHEAST ASIA TRIP AND THE MANILA;CONFERENCE;[1.] The mission to the Manila Conference and the trip to the six Asian countries is now shaping up. While there will be, as you know, some changes and additions to our itinerary, as there always are in schedules of this kind, much of it is available now. The Press Secretary will make the itinerary available to you at the door if you so desire it.;We think this is going to be a very exciting, challenging, and demanding trip. Mrs. Johnson and I are looking forward with a great deal of pleasure to returning the visits to these seven countries--of their leaders who have visited us in the last several months.;We realize that we shall be seeing an emerging Asia. The trip has many facets. Primarily, as you know, it is a mission to the Manila Conference. This is timely for many reasons, which I will not elaborate now, but will discuss later.;We shall visit six nations. I am anxious to see firsthand the proud achievements of those countries, which their leaders have told me about as they visited the White House in recent months.;For me, the trip to Australia, especially, and New Zealand, has an added dimension. It is somewhat a sentimental journey to places that are vivid in my memories from World War II days. Twenty-four years ago I was there as a very low-ranking set of eyes and ears for another President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. During the period that I spent there, brief as it was, I came to know and to love those people and to appreciate their courage and their pioneer spirit. So I look forward very much to seeing them again.;During the trip, I shall be meeting with government leaders and other officials. But I am very eager to see as many of the people of those countries as possible, and as much of their countryside and their cities as possible.;In Asia, over the last year, I have felt that there is an encouraging mood of new confidence in that part of the world. And I think also in this country there is a new interest in that part of the world, because our people are awakening to the fact that a very large majority of the people of the world live in that area of the world.;There we find the life expectancy is short. The per capita income is low. There is great opportunity to really work with our fellow human beings to give them better living and a better way of life and better opportunities that we have had here.;Regional enterprise is developing there. They take great pride in the new Asian Development Bank that I first suggested at Baltimore a few months ago. 1 The people of Asia are thinking and, I think, working not only to hasten their own national development, but to find ways to work with other nations. I want to see for myself as much of their achievement as is possible for me to see in the limited time that we have allotted.;1 See 1965 volume, this series, Book I, Item 172.;Too, I think this is a good time for the Manila Conference. You will recall that when we were in Honolulu last February, we agreed to meet again in 6 months or so to take stock and to look at the results that flowed from that meeting.;Much has happened in those 6 months. I will not try to take your time to relate it all today, but I think it is significant to point out that the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong monsoon offensive, that gave us concern, failed.;The Government of Vietnam made good its commitment to take action on the inflationary front, to devalue, to make arrangements where we could improve the efficiency of the port, the supplies we were sending there and, very important, made good its commitment to hold a free election for members of the Constituent Assembly.;There was great doubt in this country and other places in the world of the extent of the participation that would take place in that election by the peoples themselves. The terrorists did everything they could to keep the election from being held and to inculcate fear in the people so they would not go and vote.;Although we have an election coming up, a congressional election where we normally, off-years, vote less than 40 percent of our eligible people, only 50 percent in a personality presidential election, nevertheless these people, under fire, in the face of hand grenades and threats and terrorism, voted more than 80 percent.;That was a blow that caused the aggressor to suffer great loss of face throughout the world, because 80 percent of the people eligible to vote went to the polling places notwithstanding this terror, and demonstrated to the entire world their desire to have the privilege of self-determination.;The foundations have been laid and progress begun in the field for the Vietnamese "revolutionary development." And, as you know, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Secretary of Agriculture have done a great deal of work before Honolulu and following it, in the field of education, health, agriculture, and the bringing of security to the countryside.;The defections from the enemy forces so far this year far exceed the defections last year. That was a matter that we gave special attention to at Honolulu.;Meanwhile, on the world scene, our position on a peaceful settlement is now I think much better understood than in the past.;In recent weeks I have talked to most of the leaders from that part of the world. And I find from them that they realize that it is not the United States of America who refuses to come to the conference table. That, in fact, there are only two governments in the world that now appear opposed to ending the war and achieving the peace. I would hope that those who make very special pleas for peace would direct their efforts to those two governments, because they have no problem so far as the United States Government is concerned.;Therefore, I was very happy to respond to the pleas that had been made by President Marcos and earlier by President Park 2 and by the representatives of Thailand to agree to come and meet with them.;2 Ferdinand Marcos, President of the Republic of the Philippines, and Chung Hee Park, President of the Republic of Korea.;I am not unaware that some of you have found fault with my acceptance of that engagement at this time of the year. I would much prefer to have gone after my Congress had gone home--November 15th--and so suggested.;But they have an election also in Australia on November 26th, and one in New Zealand late in November. And it happens in those countries the Prime Minister is a candidate this year and running himself. They felt that I could more appropriately be away, I am sure, at least the leadership did, when I wasn't a candidate when we were having an election than they could when they were both candidates.;So we didn't feel we should wait until next year. We couldn't have it in November because of these elections. I have been criticized some for accepting. I only wonder what would have been said about me if I had said no, I refuse to come and talk to our allies about our problems or our program.;ITINERARY OF TRIP;[2.] On our travel plans, we will have arrival and departure times for each city available to you soon. Mrs. Johnson and I are looking forward eagerly to the trip. we shall be leaving Washington from Dulles Airport at 9 a.m. Monday morning. We will fly nonstop to Honolulu, Hawaii. We are going to have a very busy schedule there. That is one of my favorite States in the Union and I contributed something to bringing it into the Union.;We shall participate in a ceremony and have a stay there overnight. We are going to be up at sunrise Tuesday. We will stop for an afternoon visit in the Fiji Islands where I spent several miserable days in a hospital in World War II, in a New Zealand military hospital, incidentally.;Then we will go to New Zealand that afternoon. That will be a long day's journey. We will be crossing a lot of the Pacific and the international dateline and the time change will mean that we will virtually lose Wednesday. I am very glad it is not Sunday so some of you won't have to miss church.;We will be in New Zealand on Wednesday and Thursday, next week, and then we will go on to Australia and very happily enjoy our visit there, I hope, from Thursday afternoon through Sunday.;We shall provide times and places for you when you leave this afternoon. To show you, we will visit Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Townsville before leaving Sunday, October 23, for Manila.;I will be at the Manila Conference, as you know. It is planned for Monday and Tuesday. I will be there until Wednesday. We shall leave the Philippines on early Thursday morning en route to Thailand. We will have 2 days in Thailand, 2 in Malaysia, plus 2 in Korea. We will return to Washington via Alaska--another favorite State of mine I have not had a chance to visit since it came into the Union. I was there during the war period for a brief time.;We want and we hope now to be back home at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, November 2d. I would not want to be held definitely to those hours, but that is our hope, and our plan, for your information and your planning.;DESALINATION PROTECT IN ISRAEL;[3.] I have asked, now on another subject, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, as one of his assignments in the new post as Ambassador at Large, to begin to review proposals which have been made for a desalting electric power project in Israel.;In making this review, Ambassador Bunker will give careful study to the proposals in relation to all aspects of Israel's water problem.;Ambassador Bunker, as you know, has had a very long and distinguished record in the service of our country. He has most recently done some outstanding work in the Dominican Republic as our representative to the Council of the Organization of American States. And except for his work there I shudder to think of the situation that would confront us now.;I am especially pleased that Ambassador Bunker has agreed as one of his new duties to work on this complex subject of desalting, which holds so much hope for the future of mankind, and which I am determined to have a substantial breakthrough on during my term of office if that is at all possible.;From the beginning, the United States and Israel have viewed these explorations of world-wide cooperation with great pleasure.;We want to do what we can to solve the problem of scarcity of water. Some of you may recall that I said in my speech to the friends of the Weizmann Institute in New York 3 that the knowledge and experience obtained from all of our programs in this field will, of course, be made available to all other countries.;3 See 1963-64 volume, this series, Book I, Item 175.;I have repeatedly said that the United States is equally ready to cooperate with other countries in solving water problems.;The International Atomic Energy Agency has participated in the U.S. Israeli studies.;APPOINTMENT TO CIVIL AERONAUTICS BOARD;[4.] Another point of note that you may care to observe--I sent the nomination for reappointment of Mr. Robert Murphy of Rhode Island to the Civil Aeronautics Board today.;MEETING WITH PRINCE SOUVANNA PHOUMA;[5.] I regret I was delayed in returning. I just got in a few moments ago. I haven't had my lunch.;We had a very productive visit with the Premier of Laos this morning--somewhat longer than I had anticipated.;I had a stopover in Delaware.;SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSALS;[6.] I am quite pleased with the apparent tremendous response to the proposals I made in Baltimore yesterday to increase social security benefits and to extend Medicare to the disabled.;I have had, as you know, as I stated last April, my top advisers in the Government working on improving a system for almost 6 months. And my speech yesterday reflected some of our thinking in that field.;I was particularly pleased to observe from the ticker today the really historic move on the part of my friends, the Republicans, in the Congress, to support social security legislation.;I didn't have time to check all the record but in the first social security bill, 99 percent of the Republican Party voted to recommit the social security bill on the grounds it was socialism.;And only a few months ago, 93 percent of them voted to kill Medicare--another very important part of social security.;So now they seem to be in a big hurry to pass a bill as soon as they can. We welcome them to the vineyard. We're glad they have religion. I'll have our people work through the nights, if they care to act on it before going home. I will not insist on that, but I would welcome it. If they care to come back after the election, those of them that are coming back, I will be glad to have them act on it then.;I just refreshed my memory. I read what our dear friend, our late beloved Mr. Kaltenborn, 4 and our friend, the news analyst, Mr. Harkness, 5 said on the night of the election in 1948 about President Truman and how the President finally--after he heard that broadcast at 4 o'clock that said he is leading by a million but that can't be true, and he is leading by 2 million but that can't be true, and finally at five o'clock he heard it the last time--he said: "Well, I don't know about the polls, I don't know about the predictions, and I don't know about the columnists or the news analysts, but, boys, it looks like we are elected and we better get up and put on our clothes and get busy.;4 H. V. Kaltenborn, news commentator.;5 Richard Harkness of NBC News.;THE 89TH CONGRESS;[7.] From what I have seen in the country, I think we are going to have the best Congress in the history of this Nation when we finish our record this session.;The 89th Congress, my prediction is, historians will record as the great Congress. I would believe that the American people will realize what they have done in food, in education, in health, in conservation, in beautification, in recreation and the other things for our people and our leadership in the world and they will take appropriate action.;QUESTIONS;Now I am ready for any questions.;RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION;[8.] Q. Do you see any brighter hopes now for improved relations with the Soviet Union, especially after your talk the other day with Mr. Gromyko? 6;THE PRESIDENT. I am an optimist. I see no reason for the American people to fear the Russian people. I want and have wanted from the day I took the oath as President to be friendly with all of the peoples of the world.;6 Andrei A. Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister.;I thought that we had made considerable headway in the first few months in the exchange of correspondence with Mr. Khrushchev. But after there was a change in government, and after the very regretful developments in Vietnam and the aggression that took place there that we were committed to resist, there seemed to be a cooling of relations.;I have said nothing or done nothing to contribute to that cooling. On the other hand, I have done everything I could, with dignity and with judgment, to promote friendship with the Soviet people.;We have signed a cultural agreement, notwithstanding the fact that our "Hello Dolly I" show had been turned back just a few weeks before without justification, in the light of our agreement that then existed.;We have just completed an air agreement. We are working very hard to get the Congress to enact the consular agreement that we have presented to them, that have been renegotiating with the Russians. We are working hard on a space agreement which I proposed several months ago.;We have hopes that we can find some language that will protect the national interests of both countries and permit us to enter into the thing that I think we need most to do: that is, a nonproliferation agreement.;I spent almost 2 hours with Mr. Gromyko. I thought he was helpful. I thought it was fruitful. I believe it will be productive.;I don't want to get your hopes up. And I am not a prophet. I don't want to prognosticate. But I feel good about our meeting. I said to him that we would welcome a visit by the leadership of his country to this country, that we welcomed his people coming here in the exchange programs, and we wanted to know them better. And we hoped that they would know us better because we were the two great powers in the world. I think all of the other nations look to us to keep the peace of the world, so it is important that we understand each other and that we have proper respect for each other.;STATEMENTS IN THE SENATE ON VIETNAM;[9.] Q. Mr. President, a couple of items came up in the Senate today. Senator Thurmond says we could win the war in Vietnam in 90 days if we wanted to. And then Senator Stennis cut loose with a rather extensive speech in which he was highly critical of our manpower and materiel procurement programs concerning Vietnam.;Senator Stennis said that he believes that the funding of the war inevitably will involve higher taxes. How do you feel about these statements from these two gentlemen today?;THE PRESIDENT. NT. Well, I welcome their statements and their recommendations on military strategy. The Senate has always participated in the international developments of our country and have made great contributions to the victories that we have achieved from a military standpoint throughout the years.;From the earliest days of this Republic, Senators have expressed themselves forcibly, eloquently--in most instances wisely. But while we always consider and evaluate and carefully look at what they suggest and take it into consideration, we don't always find that in the judgment of our more professional military leaders that this is always the wisest military judgment.;Senator Thurmond is also General Thurmond. And he has a good deal of experience in this field. I haven't read what he said, but I will read it.;Senator Stennis is a very sincere man. I know he wants to do what is best for his country and he thinks this is best.;But I also have to consider what General Wheeler thinks is best. And I have to consider what General Johnson, Chief of Staff of the Army, thinks is best, and General Greene, Chief of Staff of the Marines, Admiral McDonald, Chief of Naval Operations, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.;I don't think this would apply completely here, but I recall what Mr. Rayburn said one time when I was suggesting to him a course of military action that was not completely being followed by President Eisenhower, who was then in the White House. He said to me, "Lyndon, if these people in the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a man of General Eisenhower's military experience do not know more about this than us civilian legislators, then we have been wasting a lot of money on West Point all of these years.;So what I would say, Mr. Smith, 7 in summary, to your question: I welcome the comments and the military suggestions from Senators from day to day. We will carefully consider them and then consider the Security Council, consider the Joint Chiefs of Staff's recommendation, and do what we think is in the national interest.;7 Merriman Smith of United Press International.;All of us have the same purpose. We all want to win this war--not in 90 days, but in 9 days, or 9 hours, or 9 minutes, if we can. But I am not sure that everybody has all the information on this subject that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has.;You will recall Senator Borah was somewhat guilty of harassing another President at another period. At one time he said he had better information than the President. Well, in light of the developments a little bit later, that statement didn't stand up very well.;A BOMBING PAUSE IN VIETNAM;[10.] Q. Mr. President, a number of authorities have suggested that another pause in the bombing would bring about a good atmosphere for your trip. Could you discuss the pros and cons of another pause?;THE PRESIDENT. No, Ray, 8 I don't think I would like to discuss our strategy, the pros and the cons. I would observe this: that we have had two pauses. It is about the same people, the same sources, who suggested the second pause. They asked for 12 days, and then 20, and it went 37 days that our boys sat there and watched the enemy.;8 Raymond L. Scherer of NBC News.;He didn't pause. He kept up his bombing. He threw his hand grenades. He lobbed his mortars into our troop encampments and killed our Marines, our airmen, our Army soldiers.;I would be very interested at this moment in a pause if I could have any assurance that it would be reciprocated and the other people would pause.;I don't quite understand, though, why you want me to have our Marines and our airmen pause and put their hands behind their backs while the other people don't pause, and continue to shoot at them.;After all, those are our men. And if they will pause--the aggressor will pause--we will pause immediately. If they will withdraw, we will withdraw immediately. We will lay on the table tomorrow a schedule to move out of South Vietnam, to come home, to leave no troops in that area, to give up our bases--provided they will lay on the table their schedule for withdrawal, and their schedule to get their people to quit the killing and the murdering that is going on.;Now if it develops that there is any hope that would flow from another pause, we always keep an open mind. We will make additional sacrifices if we need to. But I see nothing on the horizon at this moment that would justify my asking all 300,000 or 400,000 Americans to stand there with their hands in their pockets because someone here suggested they pause, unless their enemy would pause.;TALK WITH SOUVANNA PHOUMA;[11.] Q. Mr. President, would you summarize for us your talk with the Prime Minister of Laos this morning, especially in regard to a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam war?;THE PRESIDENT. I did that earlier today in a news conference. I don't want to be repetitive.;I asked the Premier for his suggestions on any proposals that he had and any courses that he thought we ought to consider.;He made some helpful suggestions which I will repeat to the Secretary of State, and to Mr. Katzenbach, the Under Secretary, when he gets back.;We have received very helpful suggestions from a good many leaders from that area. We met just a short time ago with the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, some several months ago with the Prime Minister of New Zealand, just recently with a leader of the Indonesian Government, with the leader of the Malaysian Government, with the President of the Philippines, and the President of Korea.;All of those people have interests there, have deep concerns there. Most of them have men there. We exchanged rather detailed viewpoints. They are helpful. We will have to see what comes of them.;I thought that the meeting this morning indicated that the people of Laos are determined to have their freedom. They do not want to be gobbled up by force. They are extremely grateful, that little country with so few people, operating under great difficulties-they are very appreciative for what the American people have done to permit them to have a modicum of freedom that might not be present except for our agreements and our arrangements.;CAMPAIGNING AFTER ASIAN TRIP;[12.] Q. Mr. President, there will be one week before election day after you return from your trip. Are you considering campaigning during that period in crucial States to which you have not yet gone, like Massachusetts and California?;THE PRESIDENT. Max Frankel 9 is probably a better authority on that than I am. We don't have any more plans at this moment. That is not to say that we won't speak somewhere this weekend. We have to look at our schedule and if I could be away from Washington on Saturday or Sunday this weekend--I always get refreshed and I gain strength from going out to see the people without going through middlemen.;9 Reporter for the New York Times.;I don't always find the same conclusions that the middlemen do. So I want very much to go to every State that I can go to. I think we will shortly have been in 30 this year. I do plan to be in Hawaii and Alaska. I would hope that I could go to many other States. But that depends entirely on the White House business. That will come first.;If I can do my job here and have any time available to go out and correct some misapprehensions that some people may have in any places about the Congress, I would be glad to do that and make any contributions I can to this wonderful 89th Congress.;MILITARY COMMITMENT OF ASIAN NATIONS IN;VIETNAM;[13.] Q. Mr. President, do you foresee or hope that as a result of the Manila Conference and your travels to the Far East and the Pacific that the nations, the other nations, participating in the Conference, will increase their direct military commitments in the Vietnam war?;THE PRESIDENT. That is not a subject of the Conference. As you must know, the Korean people have a larger percentage of their total population in South Vietnam now than we do.;The Philippine people have just recently made a commitment. The Australians have commitments there.;We are very proud of the great service all these people are rendering. The New Zealandors are there. We have help in one form or another from other nations involved in the Conference.;Our purpose in going there is to review what commitments we entered into 6 months ago, to observe the progress that has been made, to try to do other planning in the economic and political fields.;We will have a military briefing, but the military plans will not be a part of this Conference and we are not going there to lay any strategic plans or programs.;I would caution all of you not to get yourself out on a limb in that regard.;This is a follow-up of our program to wage not only a defense against aggression there, but to also try to build a stronger and a more socially conscious and better economic base in South Vietnam for the poor people of that area.;THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ROUTINE;DURING TRIPS;[14.] Q. Mr. President, this is a little bit of a personal matter, but I think there is some--;THE PRESIDENT. Do you want to go into it here?;Q. Yes. I think so. I think we have asked questions like this of other Presidents.;When you take a trip of this scope, 20,000 or 25,000 miles, could you tell us a little bit of your personal routine, how you manage to relax, what you do to protect your health? What is involved in a trip like this? I think the public has no idea.;THE PRESIDENT. I don't have any trouble relaxing.;One of my schoolmates once said to me that he knew that one man in the world would never commit suicide and that was Lyndon Johnson because he would go to sleep thinking about it.;I don't have any problem relaxing. I am treated better than most people who work in this country.;I get up early and work until 3 or 4 o'clock in the afternoon and then I take 2 hours off and have a wonderful shower and shave, and go to bed and sleep 2 hours while the rest of you people are trying to fight the traffic and get home. Then I go back at 5 o'clock refreshed and work until late in the evening.;These experiences are exciting and stimulating. I am going to be in the house of my friends, and I do always relax a little better when I am in friendly company.;THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY;[15.] Q. Mr. President, the textile industry is very alarmed--;THE PRESIDENT. What industry is alarmed?;Q. The textile industry, the domestic textile industry. It is very alarmed by the rapid increase in imports of woolen and manmade textile products. The industry seems to think your personal intervention is needed to secure relief.;What, if anything, can you do, and what relief is available to the industry?;THE PRESIDENT. I have met with the representatives of the textile mills on a good many occasions, and the textile workers, and their Congressmen and Senators who are interested in that subject.;We have explored various ways and means and have made proposals to other countries that have been helpful. We have passed legislation. The cotton bill was a great help to the entire textile industry. Anything that alarms them concerns me.;While I don't have a specific response to what I can do tomorrow in this field, I will have my people work on it and take such action that I think might be indicated.;WHY FORMOSA IS NOT ON ITINERARY;[16.] Q. Sir, you seem to be passing by this time your old friends at Formosa. I wonder if there is anything significant in that and if, perhaps, you are satisfied with the contributions that they may be making to our struggle in Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. We are not passing anyone by, Mrs. McClendon. 10 We have 120 nations in the world and you can't go see all 120 of them on one trip. We are going to visit six or seven, and that is going to be 25,000 or 30,000 miles.;10 Mrs. Sarah McClendon, representative of Texas newspapers.;I have recently been in personal communication with Madame Chiang Kai-shek. We have talked. She has visited here, as you know.;We hear their viewpoint every few days. They do not have troops committed in this area. They don't have the obligations and responsibilities and the commitments that the other nations that we are visiting do. I thought nearly everybody understood that.;VISITS BY SOVIET LEADERS;[17.] Q. Mr. President, do we understand from your response to the first question that you have extended an invitation to Mr. Kosygin and Mr. Brezhnev, through Mr. Gromyko, and if that is the case, is there any date set for it? Is it a formal invitation?;THE PRESIDENT. We did that some time ago, Mr. Deakin. 11 Maybe you overlooked it. We expressed publicly our desire, and privately our desire, to welcome any officials of the Soviet Union at any time that they saw fit to come here.;11 James Deakin of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.;We would welcome an exchange not only at the artistic level, or at the governmental level, but at the very highest levels. We have that going on in a good many fields now.;If they chose to, and if they had a desire to come and see our country, we would welcome them. That is not anything new. That has been my policy ever since we have been in the administration.;ATTORNEY GENERAL APPOINTMENT?;[18.] Q. This worked once about a Cabinet appointment. Do you have any news on an Attorney General?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I have given a good deal of thought to it, but I guess you wouldn't feel it was appropriate for me to announce it publicly here at a conference like this. [Laughter];If the New York Times will be content to give me a little more time on it, I will have a mimeographed, full statement for you and we will give it to you in a handout sometime.;THE IMPORTANCE TO THE PRESIDENT OF HIS;VISITS TO THE STATES;[19.] Q. You have returned from New York and Delaware invigorated today. Was there something in the political wind you saw up there that you could tell us about? You were a little partisan in some of your remarks.;THE PRESIDENT. I found the same thing in New York and Delaware as in the rest of the country. Those of us who sit here in Washington watch what three networks put on the air, and what three men decide you can observe from Vietnam and all of the international incidents. When we read six or seven columnists, and two or three or four newspapers, sometimes we don't get it firsthand and sometimes there is a little personal equation that gets into it, and sometimes personal opinions substitute for facts.;I think it is good to get out and see the people and talk to them. I am convinced that the complainers in this country, the critics in this country, the prophets of doom in this country, and the theorists in this country are very, very much in the minority.;In my travels in over 30 States, I have never said "You never had it so good." That is an expression of what people concluded I said.;But I have said this: Since the Democrats came into office, 10 million more people are working, and they have a 21 percent increase, after allowing for the higher prices, in their income. If people are drawing more money, and more of them are working, and you have higher wages and higher profits, then you are going to have higher prices.;But I would much rather, and I think every American would rather, pay a little more for something they have to have but have a lot more in their pocket to pay for it with. We want to keep prices as low as we can, but I have seen on the faces of the people of this country a happiness, a pleasure, and a satisfaction that is not always reflected in what I read.;I might be like Uncle Ezra, you know. The doctor told him he had to quit drinking if he would improve his hearing. When he went back, the doctor said, "Well, are you still drinking?" He said, "Yes." The doctor said, "I told you you would have to quit it to improve your hearing." He said, "Well, Doctor, I like what I drink so much better than what I hear that I just didn't take your prescription!;Now, to be perfectly frank with you, when I get out and see the people, whether those people are in Ohio, or Michigan, or New York, or even in little Delaware, I like what I see and what I hear so much better than what I read that it may reflect itself.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks on the Accomplishments of the 89th Congress.</td><td class="c6">October 15, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT [addressing Members of the Congress assembled in the East Room]: We have scheduled at 1:30 the report of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the distinguished majority leader of the Senate on the 89th Congress.;And I do not want to keep either of them waiting. Because I make certain predictions in my statement that include the hope, and the possibility, and I think, the belief that if I can get them back to the Hill promptly, maybe we can break all records for the successful production of a Congress that has been functioning now very effectively and with great pride for 174 years.;So those of you that care to, we would like for you--you are welcome to remain. We don't want you to feel that you are a captive audience.;But we will now present the Speaker and have a brief statement from the Speaker and the majority leader. And I will conclude it and then we will be glad to continue to individually greet each of you here that may care to do that.;It is with great pride that I now present the beloved and productive and most respected Honorable Speaker of the House of Representatives, my longtime, devoted friend, John McCormack.;THE SPEAKER. Mr. President, the report that I make to you this afternoon will be brief.;I can sum up the record of the 89th Congress of this House of Representatives in just one word--fabulous. We have been fortunate to have many outstanding Congresses: the 59th, under Theodore Roosevelt, the 63d, under Woodrow Wilson, the great 73d, under Franklin Roosevelt.;Then in my fourth term, I was proud to be a Member of that 73d Congress which gave life and force to the New Deal.;But this Nation has never witnessed anything like the fabulous 89th Congress, both sessions of this Congress. It has surpassed them all. Not because it has produced more legislation than any previous Congress, but because this legislation will have more meaning and deeper significance for every American than any in the past.;This Congress has heard what you have had to say, Mr. President, and has left this country a legacy of greatness.;I would like to add that in this Congress, unlike any in my memory, the second session has been just as productive as the first. These achievements do not take place magically or overnight. They are the fruits of hard work, of intense deliberation and debate, by the most dedicated Democratic Congress I have seen in my 38 years as a Member of the House.;Many, many Members of Congress, of course, merit our gratitude, but the freshmen Democratic Congressmen who provided the margin of victory in so many vital legislative battles deserve special emphasis in relation to credit.;By their words and their deeds they won their stripes in the 89th Congress, and this country needs them back again.;This, Mr. President, completes my report. We are looking forward with hope and anticipation to an even greater 90th Congress next year.;THE PRESIDENT. Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know any more difficult job in this country, and certainly not in this Government, than the job of being majority leader of the United States Senate.;And I don't know of any man that ever held that job that did it so well with such universal affection and respect from not only every Member of that body, but from every Member of the Cabinet and the President himself.;I take great pride and pleasure in presenting to you one of the most beloved men in this country, and one of my most trusted and loyal friends of many years, Mike Mansfield.;SENATOR MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to report briefly to you on the state of the great 89th Congress. In just a few days, the curtain will ring down on 2 years of towering legislative achievement.;Throughout this period, the Senate started early and worked late. You set a large and demanding task before us. The Congress met that challenge as concerned and compassionate legislators. The Senate of the 89th Congress was infused with the excitement of great expectations.;In these two sessions, we have written into the statue books legislation whose scope and excellence have never been equaled in the history of the Republic.;Mr. President, when we finish our work, the second session will add its full share to the first in its achievements. The American people are the beneficiaries.;This legislation has increased the opportunities of so very many, and has brightened the hopes of all. As one whose home was once on the Hill, you know the pride that comes from accomplishment and the fulfillment that flows from a job well done. We are very proud of our record, and I am glad that we can share this moment with you.;So, Mr. President, as you undertake your mission of peace and good will to Asia, I speak for all of us in the Senate again when I say Godspeed and our very best wishes to you for a most successful journey.;THE PRESIDENT. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, Members of Congress, distinguished guests;In the history of our country, certainly in the past, most Americans have been rather cynical about their party platforms. But this year I believe that Americans have changed their way of thinking, for this year the Democratic Party has lived up to its platform.;To enact our 1964 platform, the President recommended 170 important bills, including what we call 60 "landmark measures." The 89th Congress has passed, or we believe will pass, more than nine out of ten of these bills. Its batting average,.900, we think is a good World Series record.;We ran on our platform. We got elected on our platform. We have enacted our platform. But even more important is what is in that platform. And I want to be, briefly, quite specific.;Let's take education. In the previous 88 Congresses, 174 years, before this administration, Congress passed only six basic education bills. The first one was in Abraham Lincoln's administration. For the next one, we had to wait for Woodrow Wilson, the next one Harry Truman, and the last three for President Eisenhower.;In the 35 months since I entered the White House, Congress has passed not six, as it did in the 174 years, but 18 basic education bills. In the first 174 years, Congress invested $5 billion 800 million for education, or an average of $33 million per year in educating our children.;The 89th Congress invested not $5 billion 800 million, but $9 billion 600 million, almost twice as much as all those other Congresses put together.;Now I think you know what this will mean for our children. And I think you will live to see what it will mean for our country.;This Congress has provided assistance to the child that is 4 or 5 years old in Head Start and carries that assistance on through elementary, secondary, vocational education, higher education, until you get a Ph.D. in college, if you can take it.;Let's take health. Outside of education, we think that health is one of our most urgent problems.;In 1798 the Public Health Service was first established. From 1798 until 1963, for 168 years, 17 major health measures were enacted--17 in 168 years.;In that time, our Federal investment for health totaled approximately $10 billion-$10 billion for that entire first 88 Congresses.;Since 1963, Congress has enacted not 17 measures, but 24 major health programs-more than were enacted in all the previous 168 years put together.;The 89th Congress will allocate $8 billion 200 million for health, including medical care--that is the granddaddy of all of them-nearly as much as Federal health expenditures for all the other 168 years put together.;Let's take conservation and beautification. The 89th Congress passed 20 major conservation measures. This morning I signed an additional seven measures to extend our parks and our scenic waterways, to save our historic sites, to preserve our natural seashores, to beautify our land for our children.;This year, this Congress will bring more than 1 million acres of land into the public domain for parks and playgrounds, near our teeming cities where our families live and our people and our children grow up.;Let's take cities. We have met with the most distinguished group of mayors of both parties from throughout this land today.;The Cities Act, the Mass Transit Act, the act to clean up our dirty water and to clean out our dirty air--begin a major battle to make American cities places where American people can live full and decent lives.;Never in the history of any Congress has so much legislation been passed affecting so many people in so many of the cities of America.;Yesterday we had the very difficult and dangerous vote, but under the leadership of the great Speaker of the House, that measure, Demonstration Cities, passed the House.;May I observe, Senator Mansfield, that I hope you and the Speaker can work out your differences. If you can't work them out here in the East Room, be sure to work them out in the Capitol, because I would like to sign that bill when I get back.;Let's take consumers: truth in packaging, auto safety, tire safety, child safety are major measures to guard the health and safety of our people.;So, in short, I could discuss all the 170 bills, but I want to summarize them.;This is the education Congress, and I hope we can remember that.;This is the health Congress, and we Will gladly compare it with all the others combined.;This is the conservation Congress. This is the cities Congress. This is the consumers Congress.;And when the historians of tomorrow write of today, they will say of the 89th Congress, in my judgment, "This was the great Congress.;In closing, I would like to mention two other matters of note.;First, this was a Congress of leaders. I don't know of anyone who illustrates this better than Carl Albert, our beloved House Majority Leader, who wanted to climb out of his hospital bed last night to go down and vote for the cities bill.;Speaker McCormack had to order him not to come. And I called him this morning and talked to him on the telephone and thanked him for not coming.;Second, this was a Congress of action. It was only 1 year ago today that I asked Bob Wood to leave his prestigious place at MIT to come to Washington to head a task force on the cities, to make recommendations for the President to submit to the Congress.;In that 1 year he has been here, he has organized that task force, he has made his recommendations, the President has transmitted them to the Congress, and the Congress has passed them through both Houses.;I want to pay tribute to Mr. Wood and to Secretary Weaver, and to all the others who have done so much to provide the basic ideas for this major legislative triumph.;I think I should observe that yesterday I looked at these major measures. I was speaking to the Senate at their invitation, to come and be with them before I go on my Asian trip. And I saw there a man who was leader of another party, who had walked in on crutches, but who was still at his post of duty. I observed that while he would not want to be associated with us on some of the measures, that on a goodly portion of these measures the leadership of both sides in the Senate had cast their votes the same way.;The record in the House is a little different. The leadership of the House minority party voted with us about 30-odd percent of the time.;Now, our problem is we have provided this legislation and we must administer it and execute it in such a manner as to bring pride to its authors and to those who helped us create it.;And to all the American people, to all the people of both parties, and particularly to the leaders who are responsible for the Congress themselves, who are here today, the last thing I want to do before I leave is to say God bless you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you have done for the American people.</td></tr>

Johnson: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">November 4, 1966</td><td class="c7">THE PRESIDENT. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I will be glad to take any questions.;QUESTIONS;THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH DURING THE;ASIAN TRIP;[1.] Q. Mr. President, in view of the report you gave us on your health yesterday, could you tell us whether your doctors at any point advised you not to go on your Asian trip or to cut down on your rather strenuous pace while you were over there?;THE PRESIDENT. No, they never, at any time, considered doing it. I think the best indication of my general physical condition is that notwithstanding the minor problems I have with my throat and with the little stitching they need to do, the repair work, is that even though I had both of those problems, I did make the Asian trip.;I didn't get weary. I didn't stay tired, and I got plenty of rest throughout.;I had the advantage that some of those who accompanied me did not. For instance, from Korea to Alaska, I could sleep 6 hours in a bed that was as comfortable as a hotel room.;From Alaska to Washington, I could rest 5 or 6 hours--and you had to sit up in a chair.;Most of this weariness, I think, was some of you engaging in introspection after you got home.;EFFECT OF THE ELECTIONS ON THE VIETNAM SITUATION;[2.] Q. Mr. President, in your estimation, will the outcome of the elections have any influence on the Communist willingness, or attitude, toward continuing the war in Vietnam?;THE PRESIDENT. I am not a good judge of just what the Communists' reaction will be. I think, in the past, that some foreign nations have misunderstood the American system. I hope they will be very careful not to make any mistakes of judgment about this election.;I see no reason why the election should greatly affect any decision they might make.;The President is not a candidate in this election. I cannot conceive, if the people go out and vote, that the decision of the election could in any way change the Government's policies.;There is no one that I know of that thinks there is going to be any great change in the Senate. Although my delightful friend, Senator Dirksen, optimistic as he is, feels that there may be at least a gain of 75, I notice the chronic campaigners, like Vice President Nixon, have begun to hedge and pull in their horns.;I would doubt that there is going to be any substantial change. But I could point out that with the House of Representatives now at 295 to 140, there could be a change of 40 or 50, as there has been on an average since 1890, and not adversely affect the Government program.;I don't think it is going to affect the Vietnam situation in any event. They may talk, and argue, and fight, and criticize, and play politics, from time to time, but when they call the vote on supporting the men-the defense bill--in the Senate it will be 83 to 2, and in the House it will be 410 to 5. Everybody can understand that.;SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FAR EAST TRIP;[3.] Q. Mr. President, what do you consider to be the most significant outcome of your Far East trip?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it served several good purposes. First, I think it was highly successful. I think it demonstrated to all the world that the seven participating nations were united--united in their determination to support the men at the fighting front, united in their determination to preserve the integrity of territorial boundaries, united in their determination to develop a new Asia with prosperity and plenty, united in their determination to walk the last mile, to go to any corner, any time, meet with any government, to try to further the search for peace.;Several nations on their own have already communicated the communiquй and the results of that conference to other nonaligned, neutral nations. Mr. Harriman, 1 as my representative, has visited several important capitals. Mr. Bundy 2 is presently visiting important capitals. Mr. Eugene Black 3 is following our tracks through Asia and following up on some of the economic programs.;1 W. Averell Harriman, U.S. Ambassador at Large.;2 William P. Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs.;3 Eugene R. Black, adviser to the President on Southeast Asian social and economic development.;I think that it put the spotlight of the world on a very neglected part of the world.;I think that we realize that two out of every three people living today live in that area.;The problems are there and we faced up to those problems and presented some solutions. And I think in due time you will see that they will be effective.;THE PRESIDENT'S SURGERY;[4.] Q. Mr. President, how do you feel personally as you approach these two operations, both physically and mentally? For instance, does your throat hurt you when you talk? Do you have any feeling of dread about going under surgery again?;THE PRESIDENT. No. I don't recommend them. I don't favor them. I don't think it ought to be a part of your vacation. But those things come to you and you have to face up to them.;I think I am very fortunate that I have a job that I can kind of regulate myself, that I have a lot of good help, that I have the finest doctors and the best hospital facilities in the country.;And actually, after all, it is not anything to make a great show over. They are relatively minor. Most of the people in this room have suffered considerably more serious problems than I will face with getting a little polyp out of my throat.;I don't think it is going to be necessary that I use my throat, anyway, in the next few days.;ADDITIONAL MANPOWER FROM VIETNAM;ALLIES;[5.] Q. Sir, as a result of your talks with the leaders of our allies in Vietnam, would you anticipate that more manpower will be forthcoming from them in the near future for that war?;THE PRESIDENT. General Westmoreland made it clear that we would need additional manpower. All the participants in the conference heard his presentation. When, and, as, and if he asks for additional manpower, we will supply it, and I think that every nation involved would do what they thought was desirable and necessary to support the men that they have protecting the territorial integrity of that area.;I think it is bad for you to speculate in "Andrew H. Brown" figures about how many hundreds of thousands are going to be needed when General Westmoreland himself doesn't know. But I think suffice to say, without involving any credibility, that whatever is needed is going to be done. We are not going to leave those men there asking for support and not give it to them.;I think that we have reasonable strength there now. I think we will add to it from time to time. I would hope, of course, that the adversary would see the utter futility of continuing this confrontation and would agree to go from the battlefield to the conference room.;But until he does, the men there are going to give a good account of themselves. General Westmoreland said no commander in chief ever commanded a more proficient or competent group of men. If they need some more to help them, they will be sent.;SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD VIETNAM FIGHTING;[6.] Q. Mr. President, on that point you said recently that only two nations want the fighting continued. Does this mean the United States has had some positive indication from the Soviet Union that it would like to see the fighting stopped?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I believe most of the nations of the world would like to see the fighting stopped. I just can't conceive of any nation enjoying what is going on. And I think most of them can realize the danger of continuing this unpleasantness.;I don't know that many nations have much power to do anything about it.;I know we want it stopped. We would like to stop it tomorrow. We would like to stop it today. We would like to stop it this minute.;We will do anything we can, with honor, to stop it. We seek peace. We search for peace. We are willing to do anything we can to get peace except surrender. We are not asking any unconditional surrender on the part of the adversary. We are just saying to them, "Come in the room and let's reason together. Let's talk out our difficulties." They refuse to do that.;Now I don't know why they refuse to do it. I think that as time goes on and they see that that is the better course, I hope they will do it. And when they do, they will find us a willing participant in any meeting that can be agreed upon.;Q. Could you be more specific, sir, about the Soviet position?;THE PRESIDENT. I said that I thought every nation, except our adversaries, would like to see the fighting stopped. I am not a spokesman for the Soviet Union. I cannot speak for Mr. Brezhnev, or Mr. Kosygin, or Mr. Gromyko, 4 but I have every reason to believe that they would like to see the fighting stopped as much as we would like to see it stopped. I think everybody else in the world would like to see it stopped.;4 Leonid I. Brezhnev, General Secretary, Central Committee, Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Aleksei N. Kosygin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Soviet Union, and Andrei A. Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister.;Perhaps the North Vietnamese would like to see it stopped but our communication is bad and at least up to this time we have been unable to convince them that the way to stop it is to come to the conference room.;Now we don't know why. We wish we did know why. We would go more than halfway if we just knew which way to go.;Mr. Harriman is going one way now. Mr. Bundy is going another way now. Mr. Black is going another way. Mr. Rusk will be going to the NATO meeting. I asked him to go back through Asia on his way there, the other way around.;But until we can reason this thing out, we must maintain the strength to defend our men and to defend territorial integrity of the boundaries of our allies. We intend to do that.;THE POPE'S PROPOSAL FOR A TRUCE;[7.] Q. Mr. President, the Pope is reported to be mounting a drive for another Christmas truce, accompanied by another pause in the bombing. Would our Government be receptive to that?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not want to speculate. I don't know what proposals His Holiness might make. Whatever proposals he made would be very seriously considered, evaluated. I can't conceive of anyone feeling that one side ought to stop bombing and the other side ought to continue it.;I would hope that all this talk about stopping the bombing would have some reference to the bombing that they did on Independence Day when General Westmoreland, day before yesterday, intended to go out to a ceremony they were having and they tried to bomb the place where he was supposed to sit.;I would hope that some of this "stopping the bombing" agitation would be directed to the folks that throw the bombs at our Embassy in Saigon. We have never bombed the North Vietnamese Embassy. We have never bombed their population.;Sure, we try to hit a military target, a petroleum target, or an electric plant. But here they come in and try to bomb the seats where our Ambassador will sit, where the head of state will sit, where our general, commanding our forces, will be.;If they want us to stop bombing, we ought to see what they are willing to stop. We will be glad to carefully consider anyone's proposals that represent two-way streets.;We don't want to talk about just half of it, though.;THE SITUATION IN KOREA;[8.] Q. Mr. President, in view of the North Korean attack on an American patrol in Korea, could you assess for us the situation at the 38th parallel today?;THE PRESIDENT. We have had some increased incidents there, of late. We are filing a very strong protest for this totally unjustified murder of six of our men.;We will make the strongest representations. We would hope that it is not indicative of any continued desire on the part of the North Koreans to violate the terms of the armistice.;Certainly the United States of America does not plan to violate the terms of that armistice and we hope they won't either.;CAMPAIGN PLANS;[9.] Q. Does the cancellation of your big campaign trip mean that you do not intend to do anything to help Democratic candidates before election, such as one little speech in Texas, or maybe a TV pep talk before election?;THE PRESIDENT. First, we don't have any plans, so when you don't have plans, you don't cancel plans.;We get invited to come to most of the States. In the last 6 weeks we have been invited to 47 of the States by the candidates for Governor, or the Senate, or the Congress.;We have been invited on nonpolitical invitations to the other three States, I might;say.;But we have not accepted those invitations. We do contact the local people who extend them. We do investigate in some instances going there, and we do express the hope that we can go.;But until it is firm, until we know we can, we do not say, "We accept," and schedule it.;The people of this country ought to know that all these canceled plans primarily involve the imagination of people who phrase sentences and write columns, and have to report what they hope or what they imagine.;We have no plans for any political speeches between now and the election. We know of no requirement that we forgo them. I just don't think they are necessary.;I have had a very active year, and I would hope I could spend a relatively quiet weekend and go vote on Tuesday morning. I hope every American will go vote on Tuesday morning.;If they do, I have not the slightest doubt but what their good judgment will prevail and the best interests of our country will be served. But I have no plans to make any speeches. I have not canceled any plans that I had agreed to, although I did express the hope early in the year that I could visit as many States as possible. I visited approximately 30 this year, which set some kind of a record, itself.;If I do schedule anything between now and next Tuesday, I would feel perfectly at liberty to do so, and if I did, I would give you due and adequate notice.;ECONOMIC TRENDS;[10.] Q. Mr. President, would you give us your estimate of whether the inflationary pressures on the economy are easing up or increasing at the present time?;THE PRESIDENT. There has been a very healthy movement toward price stability in recent weeks on the economic front. I wouldn't say in the newspapers or the radio and television, but the statistics would indicate that.;The Department of Labor this morning released the wholesale price index in October. From February through October, that's roughly 10 months, we have had only a gain of.8 percent.;The index released shows that we had a decline of.6 of a percent from September. It brought the average level of prices back below any month since June.;So I think that is a very healthy movement. I want to reiterate that while we have had some gain, some increases in prices, that that has been brought about by increases in wages that we thought were very desirable in the low earnings group.;The lowest paid people in this country got some increases--the hospital workers, the bus drivers, the lower-paid group. That did bring up prices some. You can't do it without it.;But prices have increased less in the 6 years of the Kennedy-Johnson administration, with Vietnam on and all the pressures that it brings, than they did the previous 6 years in the Eisenhower administration.;The wages have increased much more and you have more money to pay the increased prices with than you did in the previous 6 years.;So I don't think anybody can make much out of that. All you have to do is say, "Well, now, if you are worried about inflation, you are an expert on it, because you had a much better record in that field than we have." 5;5 On November 6, the White House made public a report to the President by the Council of Economic Advisers on recent economic trends. The report noted that "the developments of recent weeks demonstrate that the economy continues to move ahead at a healthy pace, fortunately less rapid than the somewhat hectic pace of last fall and winter. This more moderate growth shows that public and private policies have been working effectively to achieve a sound and sustainable rate of expansion. The benefits are clearly reflected in an improved price record." The full text of the report is printed in the Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents (vol. 2, p. 1628).;THE WARREN COMMISSION;[11.] Q. Mr. President, as you know, an aura of mystery has developed around the assassination of President Kennedy. I am thinking of two or three books that were written, and some lawyers and others casting doubts on the works of the Warren Commission.;The case, as I understand it, was based on the alleged mysterious disappearance of photos, X-rays, and so forth.;Now the Justice Department discloses that the Kennedy family had these documents and they have now been turned over to the National Archives.;I wonder why that was not disclosed before, and also why this material is still not available to competent non-Government investigators?;THE PRESIDENT. First, I think it has been available to the Warren Commission any time it wanted to see it. Second, I think it is available to any official body now. Third, I think that every American can understand the reasons why we wouldn't want to have the garments, and the records, and everything paraded out in every sewing circle in the country to be exploited and used without serving any good or official purpose.;It is my understanding--all of this took place while I was away--that most of this has been over in the Archives stored all the -time. It has always been available to the Warren Commission and the Government, the Justice Department, the FBI. The late, beloved President's brother was Attorney General during the period the Warren Commission was studying this thing and I certainly would think he would have a very thorough interest in seeing that the truth was made evident. I believe he did have. I think that he, the FBI, and the entire Government made available everything that the Commission wanted. I think they made a very thorough study. I know of no evidence that would in any way cause any reasonable person to have a doubt about the Warren Commission.;But if there is any evidence and it is brought forth, I am sure that the Commission and the appropriate authorities will take action that may be justified.;EQUAL TREATMENT FOR SPANISH-SPEAKING;AMERICANS;[12.] Q. Sir, I know you have been interested in doing something for the Spanish speaking people of the country, but would you fill us in on your plans, somewhat?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have been interested in seeing that the Spanish-speaking people of the country were treated equally ever since I have been in public life.;I have had very excellent cooperation from them. I have appointed a good many of them to very high places in the Government. I have done what I could to improve their economic conditions by passage of legislation I thought would be helpful.;I have tried to do what I could to provide equality of opportunity in employment, in education, in health, and in other Government programs.;As long as I am in this of[ice, I will try to see that all Americans are treated equally. I have a very special fondness for the Spanish Americans, because I grew up with them. I learned to speak their language as a child. I went to school with them. I taught them. I have been getting them to vote for me for 30 years.;THE GOVERNORSHIP IN CALIFORNIA;[13.] Q. Last week, Senator Barry Goldwater predicted that Ronald Reagan would win the Governor's seat in California by either a minor or a major landslide.;Would you care to give us your assessment of the Governor's race in that State?;THE PRESIDENT. I would just express the hope that there has been no improvement in Senator Goldwater's judgment since his predictions of 1964.;When I see these predictions about elections, I would commend to all of your attention, before you use the people's airwaves and the advertisers' columns, that you review their predictions 2 years ago and 4 years ago, and see just how accurate they were. I did that the other day.;I went back to the predictions of how many seats they were going to gain in 1964-instead of gaining, they lost--how many seats they were going to gain in 1962, and what was going to happen in 1960.;I just hope that the predictions of Senator Goldwater, Senator Dirksen, and of ex-Vice President Nixon are as accurate this year as they were then.;I found them very undependable as prophets, although they are fine individuals.;PROSPECTS OF A TAX INCREASE;[14.] Q. Sir, can you evaluate the prospects for a tax increase in view of the price developments that you announced earlier?;THE PRESIDENT. We have the appropriation bills being evaluated at the moment. There are 1,250 separate appropriations. They will cover 2,500 various items and fields.;We are going to withhold as many of those appropriations as we feel we can in the national interest.;We hope to announce those some time between now and the end of the month, or the early part of next month.;During that same time, Mr. McNamara has his fine-toothed comb in reviewing every request of the military, to see how much we can forgo of the requests they have made. When we get that request, as we hope to before the Congress gets back here, we will then look at the revenue figure.;There are indications now that we have a great increase in revenue. If we did not have to have a substantial supplemental--I think we will have to have a substantial supplemental--I don't think we would need any tax increase at all.;But our tax increase will be determined largely by how much I can cut out of the appropriations the Congress made, and how much our men at the fighting front will require in the way of equipment and support for the rest of this year.;I will know that some time the early part of next month. And as soon as I know that, I will make appropriate studies and recommendations which will be available for the Congress when they come back.;MR. NIXON'S COMMENTS ON THE MANILA;COMMUNIQUЙ;[15.] Q. Mr. President, since the Manila meeting there has been some uncertainty as to how to interpret the withdrawal terms that were included in the communique. 6;6 See Item 549.;Yesterday, for example, Mr. Nixon said that it appeared that you had proposed, or the seven powers had proposed, getting out in a way that would leave South Vietnam to the mercy of the Vietcong.;Could you comment on that?;THE PRESIDENT. I would be glad to comment on the communiquй. I do not want to get into a debate on a foreign policy meeting in Manila with a chronic campaigner like Mr. Nixon.;It is his problem to find fault with his country and with his Government during a period of October every 2 years.;If you will look back over his record, you will find that to be true.;He never did really recognize and realize what was going on when he had an official position in the Government. You remember what President Eisenhower said, that if you would give him a week or so he would figure out what he was doing.;Since then he has made a temporary stand in California, and you saw what action the people took out there. Then he crossed the country to New York. Then he went back to San Francisco, hoping that he would be in the wings, available if Goldwater stumbled. But Goldwater didn't stumble.;Now he is out talking about a conference that obviously he is not well prepared on or informed about.;You can read the communiquй. I think it is very clear that the seven participants in that conference felt that they wanted the entire world to know that if infiltration would cease, if the aggression would cease, if the violence would cease from the standpoint of our adversary, the allies would gladly reciprocate by withdrawing their troops, and that they would withdraw them in a period of not to exceed 6 months.;Most of the nations, if not some of our own citizens, most of the countries, know that we do not plan to occupy Vietnam or dominate it, or try to determine its official life once the aggression and the infiltration and the violence there ceases.;But some of them can't understand, because I guess they wouldn't make huge investments and walk off and leave them, how we could do that.;We have explained that we would pull out just as soon as the infiltration, the aggression, and the violence ceases. We made that statement and we set a time limit on it.;Why would we want to stay there if there was no aggression, if there was no infiltration and the violence ceased? We wouldn't want to stay there as tourists. We wouldn't want to keep 400,000 men there just to march up and down the runways at Cam Ranh Bay.;But we felt if we stated it again and each of us subscribed to it, including the Government of South Vietnam, that they would ask us and ask all the other allies to withdraw their forces, if the other side withdrew theirs, the infiltration ceased, the violence ceased, that it would probably clarify our position.;We think we did that, until some of the politicians got mixed up in it and started trying not to clarify it but to confuse it.;It shouldn't be confused. Every participant in that conference, acting on good faith, with the best of motives, wanted to say to North Vietnam and every other nation in the world that we intend to stay there only so long as our presence is necessary to protect the territorial integrity of South Vietnam, to see that the violence there ceases, and the infiltration and the aggression ceases.;They know that and we ought not try to confuse it here and we ought not try to get it mixed up in a political campaign here.;Attempts to do that will cause people to lose votes instead of gaining them. And we ought not have men killed because we try to fuzz up something.;Our position is clear. We don't want to occupy that country. We didn't want to occupy the Dominican Republic. We went in there because our people were being shot at, because aggressive forces wanted to establish a form of government that was not in keeping with the will of the majority of the people of that country.;Once we were able to let the people have a free election, supervised election, let the majority speak its will, we pulled our troops out and came home.;That is what we will do in South Vietnam. When the aggression, infiltration, and violence ceases, not a nation there wants to keep occupying troops in South Vietnam.;Mr. Nixon doesn't serve his country well by trying to leave that kind of impression in the hope that he can pick up a precinct or two, or a ward or two.;AN ALL-ASIAN CONFERENCE;[16.] Q. In that connection, President Marcos of the Philippines has called for an all-Asian conference. Do you see that this might carry on the work that was begun at Manila?;THE PRESIDENT. I think that Asians who have the same interests, the same problems, not only have the right, but the duty, to take such initiatives as they may think are desirable.;That is a matter for them to decide. I think it is one thing to decide which Asians are going to participate in that conference, where it is going to be, what kind of a conference, what governments are going to be invited.;We have encouraged regional meetings. It is not a matter for us to decide, it is a matter for Asia. But the policy of the United States Government is to encourage the people who believe in freedom in Asia to get together and to talk out their problems, and to try to find solutions for them.;Merriman Smith, United Press International: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

[I.] George Christian will have for you later in the afternoon a memorandum that I signed, directed to the Secretary of Defense and the Acting Attorney General, the Secretaries of Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, HEW, Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, and the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning. 1 The subjects are the basis of creative federalism and cooperation, asking them to work with the Bureau of the Budget and the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. Our objectives are to make certain that vital new Federal assistance programs are made workable, that we take steps to afford the representatives of the States and local governments the opportunity to advise and consult in the development and execution of programs which vitally affect them.;1 See Item 606.;This is in connection with Senator Muskie's commission 2 and my determination to try to see that each agency of Government consults with local officials, mayors, and State officials. We will coordinate this through the Vice President and Governor Bryant? 3;2 Senator Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and member of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.;3 Farris Bryant, Director of the Office of Emergency Planning and former Governor of Florida.;Mr. Bob Kintner 4 came down today and brought with him reports from various independent agencies of the Government: the OEO, the FAA, the Economic Advisers, Federal Reserve, Space Administration and Council, USIA, which I briefly reviewed, also a report from Mr. Bunker 5 on the preliminary conference he had had in connection with the desalting plans in Israel, also a review Mr. Bunker sent to me, a report, in connection with the Dominican Republic, a report from the Defense agency, the Veterans Administration, Commerce, and the Post Office, on their activities for the last several days.;4 Robert E. Kintner, Special Assistant to the President.;5 Ellsworth Bunker, U.S. Ambassador at Large and former U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States.;I have also today gone over some of the subjects that various task forces and officials in the Federal Government are exploring preparatory to the State of the Union Message. These range over a very wide field, primarily the cities, education, intergovernment personnel, urban employment opportunities, older Americans, Government organization, child development, nursing homes for the elderly, career advancement, accident prevention, protection for the public, law enforcement, administration of justice, juvenile delinquency, narcotics, foreign aid, international cooperation, foreign trade, income maintenance, migratory and other farm workers, benefits for servicemen, electric power, natural resources, energy resources, resources and recreation, pipeline safety, meat and.poultry inspection, District of Columbia programs, draft, oceanography, and so forth.;These are all at very tentative stages, but they are subjects being explored carefully with a view of submitting any recommendations that may develop to the Congress.;[2.] Ambassador Harriman went with me, as you know, to the Manila Conference. Following that Conference, I asked him to visit some dozen countries in the Pacific area and then come back by Europe, to report to those countries--the heads of the governments-the developments at Manila, the success of that exchange, to ask them for their views, to urge them to make any suggestions or recommendations they have that they thought might lead to taking the differences from the battlefield to the conference table, asking them to give us any suggestions they might have for peace.;The Ambassador visited the Philippines, Ceylon, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Italy, France, Bonn, Britain, and Morocco.;He has come back and he has given me in the last hour or so a rather full report on the individual conversations he had with the various heads of state in each country, except Paris, where he saw Couve de Murville, the Foreign Minister.;In all others he saw the heads of state. He will give me a somewhat more detailed report in writing a little later.;The Secretary of State, Ambassador Goldberg, and I will review it at the appropriate time.;I think Mr. Christian has gone over with you today the conversations I have had on the phone--not any particular news value in them.;I was told you wanted to see Ambassador Harriman. I don't know what he has to tell you, but I will be glad for him to say anything to you that he said to me, that would be helpful, and answer any questions, as I will be glad to do after he talks to you.;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN'S REPORT ON;HIS TRIP;[3.] AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. As the President said, I went to 11 countries since Manila. As the President requested me to, I reported on the developments in Manila, Vietnam, and other aspects of the situation in the Far East and also discussed the matters which interested each country the most.;I found a very general appreciation of the value of the Manila Conference and new conceptions of the seven countries that sat down together. The President with six Asian countries sitting there as equals made a deep impression among the Asians.;Then the limited objectives were outlined--the willingness to come to a peaceful negotiation and the taking out of troops, with the mention of 6 months, although it was not clear when the period would begin.;It indicated definitely, and they all accepted, that the President intended to take out our troops and the other countries involved.;The fact that the seven countries spoke, although some of the statements had been made before, carried much more meaning because it was a commitment among the seven. The position of the South Vietnamese Government has been strengthened materially, I found, by the September 11 elections and also by their agreement to carry forward this process of constitutional elections.;Each one of the countries wants to see peace--a peaceful settlement. In almost every case, they recognize the need to stop aggression. There are different points of view on it, but I think it is fair to say that no country wants to see aggression succeed. They want to do everything they can. Some are able to do more than others.;In the Asian countries they were interested in the President speaking about the possibility of regional development and our assistance to Asian initiative after the end of hostilities.;In Europe they had been concerned that we were getting too interested in the Far East and would neglect our commitments to NATO.;I was able to reassure them--to the press particularly, and the television. The people are more concerned, I think, than the more thoughtful ministers. In almost every case I saw the heads of governments and the principal ministers involved.;Each country had some idea about the development of some initiative on their part. Most of them are quiet. Most of them thought that the less said about their negotiations or their discussions, the better. Each one is trying in his own way to do something, whether it be directly to Hanoi or whether it be through some other channel.;The most promising or the most immediate discussion will take place when the British Foreign Secretary, Mr. George Brown, goes to the Soviet Union on November 21 to talk to the Soviet leaders, among other things, about Vietnam.;The British have a special responsibility with the Soviet Union as cochairmen of the Geneva conference. The meeting of those two governments is a very important event. We are hopeful that something may come of it. It is impossible to predict, but at least the Soviet Union has considerable influence in Hanoi.;I found that in almost every case the leaders of the governments felt that the spectacle of the confusion that exists in Peking now and in Red China was reducing China's influence and it gave a better opportunity for a quieter attitude.;As the President has said, and I found it confirmed everywhere, every country in the world, with the exception of Red China and Hanoi, wants to see peace. That consensus, the pressure of world opinion, I think, gives us a right to have some encouragement.;Each of the individual countries, of course, has its problems, and they are naturally interested in talking about them. They are grateful for the position the United States is taking in almost every case, and are appreciative of the assistance that is given them, and are grateful for the initiative that President Johnson on a number of occasions has taken.;Are there any questions any of you would like to ask?;QUESTIONS;THE POPE'S CALL FOR A CHRISTMAS TRUCE;[4.] Q. Mr. Ambassador, did you discuss the possibility of a Christmas truce and the possibility of suspending American bombing of North Vietnam as the Pope has suggested he might call for? What is the position on the Pope's call for a suspension of our bombing and a Christmas truce?;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. I left out the fact that I had an audience with the Pope. He has since announced, today, that he is going to ask, as he did last year, for a cease-fire which, of course, would stop the fighting, which, of course, would include the end of the bombing. He hoped it would be longer than the 48 hours which was all that occurred last year. He naturally hopes the bombing, as well, will stop.;The subject of bombing did come up. Some of the countries believed it would be desirable for the United States to suggest that we stop, and they indicate some constructive action would be taken by the other side. I had to point out to them that the President stopped for twice as long last year as anyone had suggested. The only answer from Hanoi had been to push further supplies, to repair roads, to take advantage of the pause, in order to reinforce their troops. I made it also quite plain to the heads of governments and publicly that it was not of value to peace to propose, as General de Gaulle did at Phnom Penh, that the United States take unilateral action. I expressed the personal opinion that that put off the day of peace and added to Hanoi's intransigence, thinking that if they held out, world opinion would force us to take action.;I believe that most of the countries thoroughly understand the President's position and would like to see Hanoi take some reciprocal steps, which, as the President indicated, could be done formally or informally, publicly or privately. In talking it out with the different governments and also with the public I think a more balanced impression has been given.;But the subject of bombing constantly comes up. It is one in which there is propaganda coming from the Communist side, particularly from the Eastern European countries, that if the United States would only stop bombing, something would happen. It is quite clear that it is essential that Hanoi indicate what that is in advance.;U.S. PRESTIGE IN EUROPE;[5.] Q. Mr. Harriman, shortly before the election the Republicans released a poll that they said showed our prestige in Europe was dropping considerably. Did you find that to be the case?;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. No, I did not find that our prestige in Europe had dropped at all. I found there was some concern with De Gaulle's action in dropping out of the Organization of the North Atlantic Treaty that it would lead to a new situation.;They wanted to be quite sure that because of our involvement in Vietnam we had not lost interest.;But as far as the United States' prestige is concerned, there is no question about its prestige and the fact that President Johnson has taken such leadership in the development of a new sense of unity, not only in the defense, but also in the development through NATO of better relations between East and West, which is having a deep impression.;HANOI;[6.] Q. Mr. Ambassador, do you see or hear any new signals from Hanoi?;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. There are no new signals from Hanoi. It is encouraging, as I said, that the Soviet Union is ready to talk about it.;They haven't indicated they are ready to do anything.;It is encouraging that all of the Eastern European countries indicate that they are talking to Hanoi. There are third-hand conversations which appear to indicate that Hanoi is willing to talk, provided we do certain things.;I am going to be quite frank in saying that there is no specific discussion going on at the present time.;PARIS DISCUSSIONS;[7.] Q. Sir, did you ask to see Mr. de Gaulle? Is there any significance in your not seeing him but all the others?;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN. I saw the heads of governments in all other countries. But I went to Paris primarily to meet with the NATO Council, whom I talked to as a group, the 15 members, including our own. I did not ask to see General de Gaulle. But I saw M. Couve de Murville, who is the foreign minister. I paid him a courtesy call.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.;THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON THE MISSION;AND ON CABINET REPORTS;[8.] THE PRESIDENT, I want to express my very deep appreciation for the excellent job Ambassador Harriman has done, He is one of our most experienced and most astute diplomats.;He always turns in a most creditable performance. I have enjoyed his oral report and I will look forward to reviewing his written position when it is developed.;I think I have nothing further to say, other than I am following the Government hour by hour here just as if I were in Washington.;I have now received either oral reports from each Cabinet officer or written reports in some detail.;Today I talked at length to the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense.;I had met with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense before.;I had a rather full report from the Secretary of Labor. As you know, we had the Secretary of Transportation-designate down here.;We have also had a report from the Secretary of Commerce.;We have reviewed them.;We will have a quiet weekend and I will see you at church Sunday.;If you have any questions, I will be glad to answer them.;QUESTIONS;[9.] Q. How are you feeling, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Fine.;Q. That covers that.;SENATOR MANSFIELD'S PROPOSAL FOR SECURITY;COUNCIL ACTION;[10.] Q. Mr. President, when you talked to Senator Mansfield today, did you discuss his proposal relative to the Security Council?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I told him that I had heard his suggestion that the Security Council should try to deal with this subject.;We have taken that position for some time. I would like for him to talk to Ambassador Goldberg.;I did talk to Ambassador Goldberg and the Secretary of State subsequently.;Senator Mansfield is going to Florida. At an appropriate time, I hope he can exchange viewpoints with Ambassador Goldberg.;We have recommended, as you know, on a number of occasions, that the Security Council give consideration to this subject.;Our adversaries in the matter are not very willing to come into the Security Council and discuss it.;I think it is very clear that while we do our recommending, we have to find some way to get them to come in there, and also to get the members of the Security Council to be willing to do it.;We are always glad to have Senator Mansfield's suggestions. They are generally very worthy ones. We will explore them in some detail.;AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN'S TRIP;[11.] Q. Ambassador Harriman described his trip as being somewhat encouraging. I am wondering if you, too, are encouraged by what he told you about the trip.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I have heard what he said and have observed it. I will consider it. I think that is about the extent of it.;I have been with him for the last hour or so. I thought his discussions were very interesting.;MR. BUNDY'S REPORT;[12.] Q. Mr. President, you sent Mr. Bundy 6 to some other countries. Has he reported?;THE PRESIDENT. Only the cables that come in from day to day. I have not had an oral report. He is not ready for that yet. There is not anything I have to say on that.;6 William P. Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs.;LEGISLATION FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA;[13.] Q. Mr. President, you mentioned a while ago, in speaking of reports, you had reviewed some concerning the District of Columbia. Could you give us any detail at all about those?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, it is just the recommendations that we will make in connection with legislation for the District in our State of the Union Message.;We do have some legislation affecting the District now on my desk, and various reports from various departments that I am evaluating, but I have not reached a decision on it yet.;FOREIGN INVESTOR'S TAX BILL;[14.] Q. Mr. President, have you reached a decision on the foreign investors: tax bill? There have been some reports that you might pocket veto it.;THE PRESIDENT. When we act on these bills, we simultaneously, with the signature, transmit it to George Christian. Does that answer your question?;REACTION TO A CEASE-FIRE APPEAL FROM THE;POPE;[15.] Q. Mr. President, based on Ambassador Harriman's report, can you give any idea of what our reaction to an appeal from the Pope for a cease-fire would be?;THE PRESIDENT. Without responding directly to your question, I think I indicated our general attitude in my press conference the other day.;We are very anxious to always give consideration, and as sympathetic as possible, to any suggestion that the Pope makes, as we did last year.;But we are also very anxious to have other people do likewise.;We will carefully scrutinize any suggestions His Holiness makes and take appropriate action. Whatever is in the best interests of this country we will do.;ANTIBALLISTIC MISSILE SITUATION;[16.] Q. Mr. President, there seems to be some inconsistency in our hopes and the Soviet Union's hopes that we might be reaching some agreement in the nonproliferation area.;I wondered if there is any inconsistency with that optimism and Secretary McNamara's report yesterday about the antiballistic missile situation?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't think so.;Reporter: Thank you, Mr. President.</td></tr>

Johnson: Toasts of the President and President-elect Costa e Silva of Brazil.</td><td class="c6">January 26, 1967</td><td class="c7">President-elect Costa e Silva, Madame Costa e Silva, Excellencies, distinguished guests;It is a good day for us when one of our fallow Americas comes to visit us in this house. It inspires us to feel again how very much we have in common in this hemisphere-how interdependent we really are-and how very closely our destinies are woven together.;We even try to bring the weather into line--so that a Washington winter day will not be many degrees removed from a Brazilian summer.;Very soon, now, sir, you and I will have even more to share.;I mean, what our President Thomas Jefferson said, "the splendid misery" of national leadership.;After March 15, that mixture of splendor and misery will be your daily fare, as it is mine.;You will know splendor, as you work for a more abundant life for your people.;And you will certainly know misery, as you try hard to discover not only how to do what is right but to discover what is really right. The only certainty, Mr. President elect, is that you will have to act.;Fortunately for you and me, our countries are blessed with great natural wealth. They are blessed with confident and vigorous people. We are big. We are still growing. We can still experiment. We can still make mistakes and still survive.;The assurance that our people seek is not that we make no mistakes, but that we shall really never tire of seeking education for our children, better health for all of our families, better housing for all of our people, and equal justice for every man. They can tolerate honest error, but they cannot abide indifference.;Mr. President-elect, I know the goals that you seek for the good people of Brazil.;For our part, we here in America shall do all that we can do to try to help you attain those goals. The United States, today as in the past, has much at stake in Brazil.;You were our comrades in the Second War. I shall not forget that you were the first to join us in helping the Dominican people resist totalitarian rule--in making it possible for them to freely choose their own destiny instead of having it imposed upon them. That, sir, was an act of responsible statesmanship for which every free nation of America should be grateful.;Sir, we welcome you to this Capital and to this house. Know that as geography has made us neighbors, history and hope have made us friends.;Our good and delightful friends, who have honored us with your presence today, I should like to ask all of you to join with me in a toast to His Excellency, President-elect Costa e Silva and to the great nation of Brazil.</td></tr>

Johnson: Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Aid.</td><td class="c6">February 9, 1967</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;Twenty years ago, President Truman set forth the basic proposition underlying the foreign aid program when he told the Congress;I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.;This judgment was shared by Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy and by every Congress since the 79th in 1946. It is my judgment today. I believe it is the judgment of most Americans.;Our commitment to assist the economic growth and security of developing nations is grounded in the hard realities of the postwar world. We know that want is the enemy of peace and hopelessness the mother of violence.;We know that;--in the long run, the wealthy nations cannot survive as islands of abundance in a world of hunger, sickness and despair.;--the threat to our security posed by internal subversion and insurgency cannot be countered by withdrawal, isolation or indifference.;--men--acting together--have the power to shape their destiny. Around the world, from Mexico to Greece to Taiwan, we have seen the energy and determination of the emerging peoples transform our aid into the seeds of prosperity.;--abroad, as at home, the true national interest of the American people goes hand in hand with their sense of freedom, justice and compassion.;Precisely because foreign assistance programs are so vital to our national interest, they must reflect the circumstances of the late sixties, not those of the past. They must respond to the ideas which move men in the emerging nations today. They must draw upon the lessons of experience. They must take account of the growing wealth of other advanced countries.;The proposals in this message reflect the experience of our aid activities over two decades. They emphasize the six guiding principles on which our programs must be based;1. Self-help--nations develop primarily through their own efforts. Our programs can only be supplements, not substitutes. This is the overriding principle.;2. Multilateralism--every advanced nation has a duty to contribute its share of the cost.;3. Regionalism--the future of many countries depends upon sound development of resources shared with their neighbors.;4. Agriculture, health and education-these key sectors are the critical elements of advancement everywhere in the underdeveloped world.;5. Balance of payments--we cannot help others grow unless the American dollar is strong and stable.;6. Efficient administration--every American citizen is entitled to know that his tax dollar is spent wisely.;NEW DIRECTIONS;To carry out these principles, I propose;-- A new Foreign Assistance Act, stating in clear language our objectives, our standards, and our program techniques.;--A statutory National Advisory Committee on Self-Help, to advise the Congress, the President, the Secretary of State, and the AID Administrator on how effectively recipient nations are mobilizing their own resources under the self help criteria of the Act.;--A statutory objective that at least 85% of our development loan funds be spent in a regional or multilateral framework.;--More than $1 billion in programs to improve agriculture, education and health, a 25 percent increase over last year.;--A shift in emphasis in our aid policy in Africa, to concentrate our help increasingly on regional and multi-national projects.;--Sympathetic consideration of a U.S. contribution to a new special fund of the African Development Bank.;--A $200 million U.S. contribution to new special funds of the Asian Development Bank, in accord with the recommendations of the Black mission, headed by Mr. Eugene Black, my Special Representative on Asian Development.;--A reorganization of the Agency for International Development, to better carry on the War on Hunger and to promote private investment and the growth of private enterprise in the less-developed world.;My proposals for programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act in fiscal 1968 will require total appropriations of slightly over $3.1 billion. Of this, some $2.5 billion will be devoted to economic aid. Almost $600 million will be for military assistance. Funds for the regional development banks would be authorized by separate legislation.;THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1967;Foreign aid now rests on a legislative foundation enacted in 1961. This pathfinding statute has served the nation well. But the experience we have gathered over the past several years should now be codified in a new law.;I propose the Foreign Assistance Act of 1967.;This Act will contain a clear statement of the philosophy which underlies our programs and the criteria to be used in this Administration. To provide the continuity needed for sound management, it will contain authorizations covering two years. Most important, it will provide a framework for each of the basic thrusts of our aid policy.;1. Self-Help;Self-help is the lifeblood of economic development. No sustained progress is possible without it. Aid provided as a substitute is aid wasted.;Waste is a luxury none of us can afford. The only obligation tied to our aid is the recipient's obligation to itself--to mobilize its own resources as efficiently as possible. I will not ask any American citizen to contribute his tax dollars to support any country which does not meet this test.;Accordingly, the Act will make it dear that the development job is primarily the responsibility of the developing countries themselves. In no case will the United States undertake to do for any country what it should do for itself. Nor will we assist in any venture which we believe has received less than full support from the recipient country. The United States will insist on the general economic policies necessary to make our aid effective.;We are now applying strict and effective self-help standards. The results are evident in the fact that, on the average, each citizen in the major aid-receiving countries is saving one of every eight dollars he earns. These savings become investments. For every dollar the United States and other donors provide, these local sources invest ten dollars.;Still, there is an urgent need for a permanent, nonpartisan, public body to evaluate self-help performance.;Thus, the Act I propose will authorize the President to establish a National Advisory Committee on Self-Help. This Committee will consist of members from both parties, from the business community, from labor, from universities and from other walks of life. It will review and evaluate our aid programs in as many countries as it sees fit. It will examine our program to see whether the recipients are extending their best efforts and whether we are making the best possible use of our aid. Its findings will, be available to the Congress.;2. Multilateralism and Burden-Sharing Development is a world problem. No single country has all of the resources required. Equity demands that no single country be asked to carry the bulk of the load.;I propose that the Act set as an objective that 85% of our development loans be undertaken in a regional or multilateral frame work.;This action fits the trend of recent years, as advanced nations have increasingly accepted the responsibilities associated with their growing wealth. The combined value of our economic and food aid is less than seven-tenths of one percent of our national income, only slightly more than the average for all advanced countries. We devote smaller shares to foreign assistance than such countries as France and Belgium.;But these figures do not tell the whole story. Our defense expenditures far exceed those of all other free nations combined and serve their common interest. This burden too must be counted in the balance.;Thus, we must redouble our efforts to get other donors to enlarge their commitments.;3. Regionalism;Resources know no national boundaries. Rivers flow through many countries, transportation and communication networks serve different peoples, sources of electric power must be shared by neighbors. Economic advance in every part of the world has required joint enterprises to develop shared sources of wealth.;These facts underlie the growing movement toward regional cooperation;--The Alliance for Progress has transformed the inter-American system of institutions into a reliable and dynamic engine of change.;--Asian initiatives have created the framework for cooperation of all kinds. Such institutions as the Asian and Pacific Council and the Asian Development Bank are clear evidence of the new will to press forward.;I propose that the Act state that the United States will encourage regional economic development to the maximum extent consistent with the economic and political realities in each region.;I propose three steps to carry out this policy: --First, in most African countries, we will gradually shift to cooperative.projects which involve more than one donor or more than one recipient.;--Second, we will seek an appropriate means of responding to the recent request of the African Development Bank for U.S. participation in a special fund to finance worthy projects which are beyond the means of the Bank's ordinary capital.;--Third, we will respond favorably to the request for special funds for the Asian Development Bank. Preliminary explorations suggest a U.S. share of $200 million, to be contributed over a number of years with matching arrangements and balance of payments safeguards.;These proposals spring from a philosophy of pragmatic regionalism. They reflect the facts of economic life.;Political unity is neither required nor expected. But the resources available for development are too scarce to scatter among many countries when greater promise lies in joint action. We must take full advantage of the benefits of cooperation.;4. Agriculture, Health and Education;The fundamentals of a decent life are sufficient food, freedom from disease, and an opportunity to absorb as much knowledge as individual capacities permit.;These are the first goals of all societies. They must be the first objects of our aid.;I Propose that the Act establish agriculture, health and education as our primary concerns and that investment in these areas be substantially expanded.;I propose that our investment in;--agriculture rise from $504 million last year to $668 million in 1968.;--education rise from $166 million to $2:28 million.;--health rise from $192 million to $202 million.;In particular, we will wage War on Hunger. Together, the world must find ways to bring food production and population growth into balance. My proposals make clear our determination to help expand food supplies. We must be equally ready to assist countries which decide to undertake voluntarily population programs.;5. Balance of Payments;Our foreign assistance programs rest on the basic strength of the dollar and our balance of payments. This Administration will continue to see that our aid programs have the least possible adverse effect on our balance of payments.;Almost 90 percent of our economic assistance and over 95 percent of our military assistance is now spent in the United States. These programs serve to expand U.S. trade abroad. They help develop new trading patterns.;6. Efficient Administration;The Agency for International Development is a sound, well-run instrument of public policy. But, like all arms of government, AID can be improved. It can add further to its economy record--a record which includes $33 million in cost reduction last year alone, and a 20 percent cut in personnel-apart from Southeast Asia--since 1963. I am establishing two new offices in AID;--An Office of the War on Hunger to consolidate all AID activities relating to hunger, population problems and nutrition.;--An Office of Private Resources to concentrate on marshalling private investment and the expansion of private sectors in the less-developed world--the best long-term route to rapid growth.;Both of these steps are consolidations-they will require no new appropriations or personnel. They will focus the attention and energy of the Agency directly upon two priority areas. They are significant steps forward.;ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE;LATIN AMERICA;For Latin America, I recommend an economic aid program of $624 million.;This amount is clearly justified by our own interests and the recent performance of our Latin American partners. The program I propose is lean and concentrated. Nearly 70 percent of it will be committed in four countries--Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile. In each case, we will make certain that the amount actually spent is in accord with clear needs and meets the strict self-help criteria of the Act.;The outlook for a solid return from these expenditures is promising: --Brazil shows greater economic dynamism than at any time in her recent history. She has forced inflation down from the 1964 high of 140 percent to 40 percent--still far too high, but an enormous improvement. Her balance of payments situation is well under control. Agricultural production has been increased. Per capita income is up. In general, the economic situation is more hopeful than the most favorable predictions of three years ago;--Peru continues its steady economic climb. Per capita income last year was $378, compared to $325 five years before. The critical job now is to bring more people into the economic mainstream, while further stimulating the developed coastal areas. U.S. contributions will be heavy in the areas of agriculture and education.;--In Chile, the favorable copper market will make possible a reduction in our aid. We will concentrate our help in the crucial rural area to increase agricultural production and exports.;--In Colombia, economic trends are also encouraging. Our contributions will be made through a group of donors led by the World Bank. We will concentrate on agriculture and education.;--Our program for Central America-Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras--is tailored to support the Central American Common Market. This Market is one of the most promising innovations in the developing world. The spirit it reflects has already increased trade within the Central America region by 400 percent over the past five years. We will make modest contributions to the Central American Integration Fund to continue and accelerate this pace.;--The balance of my request is largely for the Dominican Republic and Panama. It is essential that we maintain strong programs in these countries, although they will cost slightly less than in the past.;The vision and hard work of 450 million people in this hemisphere have made the Alliance for Progress into one of the great tools for human betterment. Its success is by no means assured. There will be disappointments as well as achievements along the way. But it is a vehicle for the hopes and energies of a continent. The program I propose will carry it forward.;Meetings among the governments of the Western Hemisphere during the year may produce further proposals, such as replenishment of the resources of the Inter-American Development Bank. Where these proposals merit our consideration and support and require action by the Congress, I will submit my recommendations to you at the appropriate time.;NEAR EAST-SOUTH ASIA;For the Near East-South Asia, I recommend a program of $758 million.;This region provides the harshest test of free institutions: --Nowhere else in the free world are there so many people: as many as the combined populations of North and South America and Western Europe.;--Nowhere else do so many people live in such dire poverty: per capita income for nine out of every ten persons is under $100 per year.;--Nowhere else are divisive forces so poised to take advantage of any misstep. Several advanced nations have banded together, under the leadership of the World Bank, to form an Aid Consortia for India and Pakistan. A similar group has been formed for Turkey, chaired by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. These groups determine the share each member will contribute and provide a forum for continuing discussions with recipient countries. They have served the interests of all parties.;In my Message on Food for India, I proposed that food and related aid be added to the agenda of the consortium for India as an additional area of assistance in which all donors should join. We will exert the full extent of our influence to insure that this consortium becomes the primary vehicle for all aspects of development aid to India-from grants of funds to evaluation of performance.;Despite the shadow of famine and the ever present danger of renewed frictions, the situation in the three countries--India, Pakistan and Turkey--which will receive 91 percent of our aid to the Near East-South Asia gives reason for hope;--India is trying to regain the lead in the race between her expanding population and her food supply. She plans to double her outlays for agriculture in the next five years and to quadruple her voluntary population program. India has increased fertilizer purchases by 85 percent and has started crash programs in farmland development. She has begun campaigns to increase supplies of better seeds and pesticides. But Indian performance is not confined to agriculture. In early 1966 she liberalized her system of import controls and devalued her currency. All advanced nations must come to her aid if these hard-won opportunities are to be realized.;--Pakistan has an outstanding economic record. Her future is brighter still. From 1960 to 1965, her Gross National Product grew at an average annual rate of 5.8 percent compared to 2.5 percent previously, agricultural production grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 percent compared to 1.6 percent previously, local private investment grew by 54 percent, and total private investment was 63 percent over planned targets.;--Turkey also has a remarkable record. We and other Western nations are determined to help Turkey meet its goal of self-sustaining economic growth by 1973. She is already well on her way. In -1966, her Gross National Product grew by 8.3 percent, industry by 9.5 percent, agricultural production by 11 percent, and the use of fertilizer by 40 percent. The percentage of children of school age enrolled in primary schools increased to almost 80 percent.;If it cannot be demonstrated that hard work, coupled with relatively modest amounts of our aid, will produce better lives for the countless millions of this region, our cause will surely fail. The programs I propose will enable us to continue meeting this challenge.;AFRICA;For Africa, I recommend a program of $195 million.;Africa is undergoing the historic growing pains of attaining stable independence. Thirty-five of her thirty-nine nations have gained their freedom since World War II, many in the past five years. The inevitable strains are evident in the headlines of the world's newspapers.;The most hopeful sign of growing African maturity is the increased support for cooperative economic enterprises. With 14 countries of less than 5 million people each, this attitude is essential for progress.;Our AID policy toward Africa will;--encourage the African activities of the World Bank and its affiliates.;--direct a greater part of our resources into projects and programs which involve more than one African country.;--seek new breakthroughs in private investment in Africa, particularly the current efforts by private American banks and other financial institutions.;EAST ASIA;For East Asia, I recommend a program of $ 812 million. East Asia, I recommend a program of $ 812 million.;Nearly 85 percent of our assistance to this region is directly or indirectly related to our effort to block Communist aggression.;My recent visit to Asia confirmed my deep conviction that foreign assistance funds for Vietnam and surrounding countries are just as important as military appropriations. They are vital to a successful war effort. They permit us to build for the future.;Most of these funds--about $650 million-will be used in Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. The $550 million planned for Vietnam is indispensable to military success, economic stability and continued political progress. It will stimulate and support measures to bind the people and government of South Vietnam together in a common cause. It will help to begin the task of reconstruction and development. It will relieve war-time suffering for millions of Vietnamese.;In Laos and Thailand, these funds will finance economic development and security which will assure that armed conflict will not engulf all of Southeast Asia.;Our assistance to Thailand will be channelled through a new consultative group of thirteen donors, chaired by the World Bank. In Laos, five other countries will join the U.S. with significant contributions.;Elsewhere in free Asia, the tide of history clearly favors progress: --In Korea, the economy is now growing at the rapid annual rate of 8 percent. Industrial production is rising at a 14 percent rate annually, agricultural production at a 6 percent rate. In the few short years since the Korean War, the Republic of South Korea has become strong enough not only to maintain its internal advance, but to help in the defense of freedom in Vietnam.;--In Indonesia, the new government has committed itself to a program of economic rehabilitation and recovery. We are joining with other European and Asian nations to provide urgently needed help to the stricken Indonesian economy. We are also participating in arrangements with other nations to reschedule Indonesian debts.;The road ahead in East Asia is long and dangerous. But these accomplishments are hopeful signs. We will encourage the vital and progressive spirit that has stimulated them.;MILITARY ASSISTANCE;For military assistance, I recommend appropriations of $596 million.;This is the smallest request since the program began in 1950. In part, this fact reflects transfer of appropriations for military assistance for Laos, Thailand, NATO Infrastructure and international military headquarters to the budget of the Department of Defense.;But this request also represents a substantial reduction. Military assistance outside Southeast Asia is now only 45 percent of what it was in 1960.;For the Near East-South Asia, I recommend $234 million, down 50 percent from 1963. Virtually all this will be used in Greece, Turkey and Iran, three countries which have shared the burden of mutual security for twenty years.;For East Asia, I recommend $282 million, almost entirely for Korea and Taiwan. We will use these funds to strengthen these outposts against further Communist expansion in Asia.;For Latin America, I recommend $45.5 million, largely for internal security and training.;For Africa, I recommend $31 million, heavily concentrated in countries where we have major interests and where there are problems of internal security.;It is not the policy of the United States to provide sophisticated arms to countries which could better use their resources for more productive purposes.;It is the policy of the United States to help;--where we are asked.;--where the threat of invasion or subversion is real.;--where the proposal is militarily and economically sound.;--where it is consistent with our interests and our limited means. This will continue to be our policy.;THE CHALLENGE AHEAD;The programs I propose represent the minimum contribution to mutual security and international development which we can safely make.;There are some who say that even this request should be foregone in view of needs at home and the costs of the struggle in Vietnam.;Nothing could be more short-sighted and self-defeating. This country--the wealthiest in human history--can well afford to devote less than seven-tenths of one percent of its national income to reduce the chances of future Vietnams.;Some would have us renege on our commitments to the developing countries on the ground that "charity begins at home.;To them, let me emphasize that I have recommended no charity, nor have I suggested that we stray from home. The inescapable lesson of our century, inscribed in blood on a hundred beaches from Normandy to. Vietnam, is that our home is this planet and our neighbors three billion strong.;Still others have grown weary of the long, hard struggle to bring the majority of the world's population out of the shadows of poverty and ignorance.;To them, let me say that we are dealing in decades with the residue of centuries. There is no shortcut. There is no easy way around. The only effective tools are ingenuity, capital and, above all, the will to succeed.;All of us sometimes find ourselves sympathizing with these complaints. All of us are subject to the frustrations, disappointments and shattered hopes which accompany a supporting role in a task which must fundamentally be performed by others. But, in the cold light of reason, our responsibility to ourselves and our children reasserts itself and we return to the task with renewed vigor.;I am confident that the American people have not lost the will and the dedication which have made them the most powerful and responsible nation on earth.;I am confident that they will go forward into the new era of world progress for which their past efforts have prepared the way.;I am confident that their vision will transcend the narrow horizons of those who yearn for a simpler age.;The proposals I offer today are the practical requirements of that vision. To do less would endanger all we have accomplished in the past two decades.;I know that this test shall not find us wanting.;LYNDON B. JOHNSON;The White House;February 9, 1967</td></tr>

Johnson: Message to the Congress Transmitting 20th Annual Report on U.S. Participation in the United Nations.</td><td class="c6">March 9, 1967</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;I am submitting herewith the twentieth annual report on United States participation in the United Nations, covering calendar year 1965.;That year gave new evidence of our country's vigorous commitment to the world organization, and to the cause of peace which it serves. All of the American efforts recorded here--whether political, economic, social, legal or administrative--were designed solely to further that commitment.;The whole world shared our grief when Ambassador Adlai E. Stevenson died in London on July 14, 1965. The respect and affection in which he was held, and the world's gratitude for his contributions to the United Nations, found expression in messages from officials and leaders around the globe., and in the rare tribute of a memorial meeting in the General Assembly hall at the United Nations.;One measure of a nation's regard for the United Nations is the quality of representatives it sends to the Organization. Accordingly, I asked Arthur J. Goldberg to leave the Supreme Court of the United States and to succeed Ambassador Stevenson as our Permanent Representative to the United Nations.;Ambassador Goldberg's first important task was to help end the paralysis suffered by the General Assembly in 1964 as a result of the U.N. constitutional crisis. It had become clear that the membership as a whole was not prepared to apply the penalty provided by Article 19 of the Charter--loss of vote in the Assembly for those more than two years in arrears--to those members who had refused to contribute their assessed shares of certain peacekeeping operations. On August 16, Ambassador Goldberg announced that the United States would not seek to frustrate the evident desire of many members that the General Assembly should proceed normally. At the same time, he made it clear that the United States reserved the same option to make exceptions to collective financing assessments in the future.;The consensus reached by the General Assembly included agreement that the Organization's financial difficulties should be solved through voluntary contributions, particularly from those delinquent in their payments. A few nations contributed, but those furthest in arrears did not. The financial condition of the United Nations thus remained precarious.;During 1965, the Security Council made a major contribution to international peace by halting the hostilities between India and Pakistan arising from the Kashmir dispute. In thus arresting a full-scale war on the subcontinent, the Organization prevented untold tragedy in Asia--and proved anew its value as an instrument for peace.;United Nations peace forces and truce supervisors continued to stand guard throughout 1965 in Cyprus, in Kashmir, in Korea, and along the troubled borders of Israel. The Security Council also dispatched United Nations representatives and observers to the Dominican Republic during the disorders there, but the primacy of the Organization of American States in dealing successfully with this regional problem, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, remained unimpaired.;During the year, concrete steps toward disarmament were again strongly urged from all quarters, although progress proved disappointingly slow, the serious problems of race relations and colonialism in Southern Africa were also a cause of increasing debate and concern, and the United Nations and its members were repeatedly urged by the United States to join in the search for peace in Vietnam.;In my speech in San Francisco on June 25, 1965--the Twentieth Anniversary of the United Nations--I called upon its members to use all their influence, individually and collectively, to bring to the negotiating table those who seemed determined to continue the conflict. Ambassador Goldberg addressed similar appeals to United Nations members. Indeed, in his first official communication as U.S. Representative, a letter to the Security Council President on July 30, 195, Ambassador Goldberg recalled the legitimate interest of the Security Council in the peace of Southeast Asia and asserted that "The United States stands ready, as it has in the past, to collaborate unconditionally with members of the Security Council in the search for an acceptable formula to restore peace and security to that area of the world.;Unfortunately, these initiatives produced no affirmative response from those supporting the aggression against South Vietnam. Two suspensions of the bombing of North Vietnam during the year were no more successful in opening the path to honorable negotiations. The tragic conflict continues unabated in Vietnam. But we are continuing our efforts untiringly to seek a peaceful settlement of this issue through the United Nations and all other channels. This was the key issue dealt with in Ambassador Goldberg's statement to the twenty-first General Assembly in the general debate in September 1966.;The year 1965 marked the mid-point of the United Nations Development Decade. It was a year of sober assessment. Despite substantial progress in some areas, it was clear that in most of the more than one hundred countries with per capita incomes of less than $200, economic growth had been largely swallowed up by the mounting tide of population growth. Multilateral programs of aid, trade, and investment, although substantial in absolute terms, are not sufficient--even when combined with all the other large programs, public and private--to narrow the "development gap.;This discouraging assessment stimulated new efforts to cope with development problems;--The newly created U.N. Conference on Trade and Development began its search for new trade patterns and practices which would benefit the developing countries.;--The establishment of a new U.N. Organization for Industrial Development was approved by the General Assembly.;--The U.N. Development Program was established by merger of the U.N. Expanded Program of Technical Assistance and the Special Fund. The United States had worked long and hard for the integration of these two major U.N. operational programs in order to permit better planning and more effective use of resources.;--Foundations were laid for the new Asian Development Bank with a capitalization of $1 billion, including a $200 million subscription by the United States. It promises to be one of the most effective agencies for the financing of economic and social development in Asia.;--A new African Development Bank, designed to play a similar role in Africa, opened for business.;Through these and other instrumentalities, our delegations in U.N. agencies have given leadership and positive support to major goals in the struggle for a better life: more food production, assistance in voluntary family planning, the training of skilled manpower, development of transport and communications, fuller utilization of natural resources, and increased application of science and technology.;The year 1965 had been designated International Cooperation Year (ICY) by the U.N. General Assembly, and U.N. members were urged to commemorate it in appropriate ways. The culmination of the American celebration was a White House Conference attended by more than 5,000 distinguished Americans--leaders in their communities, in business and industry, in educational and labor organizations, in the arts and sciences, and in the professions. The Conference discussed reports on international cooperation in agriculture, atomic energy, disarmament, health, the welfare of women and youth, and many other fields. Many of its recommendations have already been put into effect. Others are being thoroughly evaluated by a special White House Committee which will shortly submit its report to me.;Public support for the United Nations continued at a high level as the Organization approached its twenty-first anniversary. Most thoughtful people know that the United Nations is a far from perfect organization, in a far from perfect world. Yet they also recognize that it and its specialized agencies are the best system yet devised for sovereign nations to work together with equality and self-respect.;Our investment in the United Nations, and its various agencies and special programs, supplements other activities undertaken to preserve, protect, or promote a wide range of national interests. Above all, our commitment to the United Nations is an expression of faith which has illuminated the entire history of our country: a faith that the creative powers of democracy and human reason can overcome the evils of tyranny and violence.;LYNDON B.

But the struggle was not limited to one of ideology.;Force had to be met with force. Americans had to shoulder rifles, man tanks and warships, and take bombers into the air, all at great risk to their lives and at a great distance from their homelands.;The ideological debates continued over the wisdom of involvement or noninvolvement;The "America Firsters" had their say, but the aggressors could not be stopped by argument.;People who desired to live in freedom could not be protected by debating points.;The defense of freedom required then, as it requires now, the willingness of brave men to face danger, to risk death, and to live with their fears for months and years on end.;Today we are here to decorate 12 men, all of whom risked their lives many times in the air over Vietnam.;As their Commander in Chief and the representative of the people whom they have so gallantly served, I salute them with all my heart.;There are some respects, as professional soldiers know, in which this war is different from the others that we have waged. There are no sharply defined battlelines. The random terror of the subversive--not the methodical power of a conventional army in the field--is the enemy's main weapon.;Political and social forces are at work that complicate the struggle and make it necessary to do far more than wage a traditional military campaign.;We met these past 2 days here with leaders--Vietnamese and Americans--to discuss some of the elements of this different kind of war in Vietnam.;We brought here the new team of American representatives to Vietnam;Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, who has served his country with great distinction in the Dominican crisis, in India, in Italy, and many other posts of the highest responsibility, Ambassador Eugene Locke, who now represents us in Pakistan, and Robert Komer, who until now has been in the White House as my counselor on the civil side of the Vietnamese war.;We wanted these distinguished Americans to meet the leaders of Vietnam with whom they will be working in the months ahead.;We came here to discuss seven of our major concerns in Vietnam today;First, the military progress of the war, both in the South and in the North;Second, the political progress that is being made in South Vietnam;Prime Minister Ky gave me a copy of the new Constitution which the freely elected Constituent Assembly had just adopted in South Vietnam and which the Directorate had just approved. This is the third and the most significant step that South Vietnam has taken toward granting its people the fundamental rights of democracy.;Third, we discussed in some detail the morale, the health, the training, the food, the clothing, and the equipment of our superb young fighting men.;I questioned General Westmoreland closely on all of these matters and his response was deeply gratifying to me.;Fourth, the national reconciliation program in Vietnam;Fifth, the land reform program which is moving steadily forward;Sixth, the extent of civilian casualties and what is being done to help those who are injured or who are wounded by the war;Seventh, the possibilities of bringing an end to this conflict at as early a date as possible by an honorable settlement.;We did not adopt any spectacular new programs at this meeting. We said in advance that that was not our plan. The nature of this war is not amenable to spectacular programs or to easy solutions. It requires courage, perseverance, and dedication--exactly the qualities that men such as you are providing today.;So to all of the men of this Command, and their families who so loyally stand by them in this hour of trial, let me say as we leave Guam that all America honors you and is grateful to you.;We feel refreshed by the conviction that on every front--military, political, and social--we and our allies are making substantial progress. When the inevitability of that progress finally gets through and becomes clear to Hanoi, we shall then arrive at what Churchill would have called "the beginning of the end.;So I leave you today with pride--great pride--in what you are doing, and great confidence for the country that you serve.;I do not want to let this occasion go by without presenting to you some of the great public servants who lead this Nation in this critical period.;I want to introduce your Secretary of State--Dean Rusk.;Next I want to introduce your Secretary of Defense--Robert McNamara.;Ambassador Bunker and Ambassador Locke.;The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Wheeler, Admiral Sharp, General Maxwell Taylor, General Westmoreland, and your distinguished Governor of Guam.;Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks to the National Legislative Conference, Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO.</td><td class="c6">June 12, 1967</td><td class="c7">Mr. Haggerty, presidents of the internationals, delegates to the Building and Construction Trades Legislative Conference, my friends in the labor movement;As President of the United States, this is the third time that I have had a chance to come and speak to you. Because I so deeply appreciate your invitation, I will not take much of your time this morning--because I am very mindful of the old saying;Blessed are the brief, for they shall be invited again.;As most of you know, the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, had planned to speak to you today, but he went into the hospital for some minor surgery Friday night. I spoke to him on the telephone just before I left the White House this morning and he is feeling as fine and as chipper as ever, and he expects to be back on the job day after tomorrow. He asked me to extend to each of you his warmest, best wishes and his regrets that he could not be with you today.;He does plan to see you later--in the days ahead.;I don't think I have to tell this audience that Hubert has had a lifelong dedication to the cause of organized labor. I think you might be interested, though, in some of the reports that have come out of Bethesda since he went there for this operation.;The first thing the Vice President wanted to know was if the surgeon had a union card.;Then he inquired if the operating room was an open shop or a dosed shop.;He constantly referred to the head nurse as the job steward.;He, finally, checked carefully to see that his hospital room number was not 14(b).;The Vice President is such a firm believer in organized labor that about a month ago I asked him to lend me a hand in trying to organize the Congress. Unfortunately, as of this morning, I must report that so far we have not recruited even one member for the "International Brotherhood of Congressmen.;It is good to be back here before the Conference of the Building and Construction Trades Department. I have always felt much in common with this group and with this membership. You are engaged in doing the thing that I think speaks best for America-you are builders. You are building up America.;Recently, I realized that we even had more in common than that. As I have looked out my White House window onto Pennsylvania Avenue these last few months, and as I have traveled about America--and I have seen an occasional demonstrator here and there--I realized that I could assure you this morning, with very deep personal feeling, that you are not the only ones concerned with on-site picketing.;Seriously, now, I said a moment ago that you were the builders of America. I don't think I exaggerate that. Each year more than 80 percent of all the building in America is built through the labor of your 18 international unions. What is perhaps even more significant is that in the 22 years since World War II, America has been built once over again. The value of our postwar structures in America exceeds that of all the construction accrued through to 1945.;In other words, we have built more since the war ended than we had in all the time up to 1945. So you not only do most of the building of a nation, but you do it in a nation that is one of the buildingest nations in the history of all mankind.;I am not here to just pat you on the back, for the future is even more exciting than the past. If it took two decades to build America over again once, it will take much less time-probably closer to one decade--to do that much more building again.;So your job and my job and the job of all Americans who are interested in the future of their country is really, literally, just beginning.;America will be built over again in the years to come--and again and again. And if she is to retain her vitality and her life, we are going to have to watch this building and do it constructively.;Each time this Nation rebuilds itself, it must be better. It must improve itself, it must correct the errors and the omissions of the previous generations.;On the Federal level, we have already begun;We are encouraging the building of highways. We are doing almost twice as much as we were in 1961.;We are encouraging the building of hospitals. We are constantly expanding that program.;This year, in the field of health, our program will be about three times as large as it was 3 years ago. This year we will allocate, on the Federal level, to health expenditures, about $12 billion. It was $4 billion 3 years ago when I became President.;We are encouraging the building of schools. This year we will spend about $12 billion in the field of education in the United States. Three years ago we were spending about $4 billion. So in 3 years we are spending three times as much to educate your child and to bring health to your body than we were 3 years ago.;We are encouraging the building and the rebuilding of our central city areas, first, through urban renewal and now through the model cities program.;We have tried rent supplements. We have tried to expand our housing efforts every way in the world that we can.;So, what it adds up to is: The group of men here, working with their Government, are the builders of America. That is why I wanted to come and be with you.;You know the old story--you don't have to be organized, you don't have to have any leadership, you don't have to be constructive to kick a barn down--any donkey can do that. But it takes a mighty skilled carpenter to build one.;When you see the building that is taking place in America, you will find the complainers will find it too hot or too cold, too wet or too dry, too big or too little, too small or too large--and there will be mistakes.;Show me a man who never made a mistake and I will show you a man who never did anything.;It is pretty difficult for a man--even at home--to get to his front gate without somebody barking at him.;But you builders will have monuments. that stand to your memory long after the complainers have been laid away. We may have to call on you from time to time to. help us deal with these complainers.;I think you know as well as I do that a nation is not rebuilt better and stronger only with bricks and mortar or wire and pipe. A new schoolbuilding with old books, and underpaid teachers and overcrowded classes and old ideas, is an old school in a new shell.;A new housing development in a ghetto does little good--for anyone--if the people in it are unemployed.;So we must rebuild America--not just the Government--in human ways as well as physical ways.;--Our schools and our education must not only be newer, but must be better.;--Our people must be trained for the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past.;--Our elderly must have the wherewithal not only for subsistence but for dignity.;--Americans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds must receive the equality that other Americans have taken for granted for centuries. I know that within your unions, there has been progress, great progress, over recent years, but I know, as you know, that more and more remains to be done.;And even all that will not be enough. A rebuilt America--fairer, stronger, more prosperous, better educated, with better health--will only be a hollow echo of itself if it exists in a world of chaos and tyranny and cruelty. So we strive for a better world all over the world.;When we met 2 years ago, we faced a grim and difficult situation in the Dominican Republic and in Vietnam. At that time this great organization sent a message of support to me. It was the very first organizational message that supported our commitment in Vietnam, and it was followed by many others from all over America. I have never forgotten that.;Today, thanks to your support and to the support of most of our fellow Americans, the Dominican Republic flourishes under a free and democratically chosen government-where there has been self-determination and the people, themselves, could select their leaders from the inside instead of having them selected for them from the outside.;In Vietnam, again thanks to your support and the support of most of our fellow Americans, the military situation has been reversed--has turned around totally since that time when you met 2 years ago.;So as I speak here today, we persevere militarily in Vietnam, always hoping and working for a negotiated settlement that will bring peace to that troubled country.;Last week, at another time of deep world crisis, we saw again that the peace of the entire world can hang precariously upon events occurring in very small and very faraway nations.;Today, in the Middle East--as in Vietnam and in America--we are faced with a task of rebuilding--of putting together a human equation, where men can live together in peace and harmony--where men can live as the Prophet Micah said, "Every man under his vine and fig tree, and none shall make them afraid.;That is America's goal in the world at large, as well as our goal at home: We covet no territory. We seek no dominion. We want not an acre of anyone else's land.;But we do want to give men the opportunity to stand straight and to stand free, to grow to the outer limits of their own ability and to be able to do this growing without fear.;If we are real builders--as you are, and as all of us should be--that is what we will build for our sons and for our grandsons.;As I said to your international presidents, we have not achieved everything we wanted to domestically. We have been engaged in some fights we have had our reverses from time to time.;But we have moved ahead. We are making progress. There is not a nation in the world that wouldn't like to emulate our growth, our prosperity, our strength, and our advantages.;During the 4 years that I have attempted to lead this country, we have had an unparalleled record of constructive, statesmanlike cooperation between the leaders of the labor movement in this country and the leaders of the business movement in this country and the leaders of the Government in this country.;Whether you are tall or short, whether you are fat or lean, whether you are a Republican or Democrat, whether you are a southerner or a northerner, easterner or westerner, I can truthfully say to each of you this morning that in my associations with you--under the leadership of that grand American, George Meany--you have always put your country first. You have been a source of strength and comfort to your President instead of harassment and tirade.;I came here to tell you that--and to say to you that I am not only grateful, but I think free men everywhere ought to be thankful for the job of building that you have done for America and other free nations.;I--on behalf of all the American people-want you to know that we do appreciate what you have done.;Thank you.</td></tr>

The political winds blow very strong around here. I have observed in the last few days that it can turn very chilly, very suddenly. A little reassessment will change the entire course of these things.;One famous American humorist, Mark Twain, must have been thinking of Washington when he once said: "In the spring, I have counted 136 different kinds of weather inside of 24 hours.;Mr. President, that is particularly true of Washington in election years.;Just last week, we had a new weather front move in very suddenly. This one came from up on the Hill of the United States Senate and caught some people just standing out in the cold. They had to start running just to keep warm.;But we, Mr. President, are very glad that we can offer you our warm hospitality here in this first house of the land tonight. I know you will agree with me that all of us can learn much from the family of Latin American nations. They are a family of nations that have learned to live together and to live in peace together.;There has been no fighting of any real significance among them for more than a quarter of a century now. Mr. President, this is the trend that should unite all of the continents in a common cause. This thing we call peace is a thing that we want most. It can be the contagious spirit that excites all mankind to the miracles that men can work if only men can learn to work together in trust--and in friendship--and in peace.;Mr. President, your administration's motto is "Peace and progress and work." I share your very deep conviction that there can be no lasting peace without genuine progress.;All men of all faiths want peace. But there are different kinds of peace, men have different judgments about the better ways to obtain peace.;The great Prime Minister of Great Britain thought of one way to get peace--Mr. Chamberlain---but he was disillusioned.;Another Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, thought of another way to get peace. As a consequence, many men had to pledge their lives, their blood, and their treasure.;But now it has been more than two decades. I think it has been confirmed in the eyes of history that a quick peace, an easy peace, is not necessarily a just peace-and a peace with honor that will last.;Frequently you can lose more lives with a phony peace than you can with a just one.;So, Mr. President, I know that you agree that there can be no genuine progress without peace in the world and without a fair reward for hard work. That statement will stand emphasis in this country--and in other countries in the world today. There can be no assurance of a fair reward unless people can share fully in all the aspects of their national life.;Mr. President, I have been thinking of your visit since we were together in Punta del Este and since the unity and peaceful nature of the nations of the Western Hemisphere was brought together there and we resolved to unite.;The United States tonight stands eager and ready to encourage such developments as are contained in your administration's motto throughout Latin America.;Mr. President, we take great pleasure, Mrs. Johnson and I, in welcoming you to this house as a leader who is trying his best to speed the growth of his nation and who, I have observed, is making contributions to the progress of this hemisphere.;As your representative of your country sits on the Security Council of the United Nations and works in his own way every day to try to better humanity, the American people take this opportunity to express to you, and through you to him and your people, our gratitude for his conscientious approach and his dedicated effort.;Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to ask all of you to join me in a toast to President Alfredo Stroessner and particularly to the good people of Paraguay.;[Following the toast the President continued speaking, as follows:];Mr. President, when I was a young man in grade school one of my first declamations that I had to memorize contained the phrase that "The most beautiful vision these eyes ever beheld was the flag of my country in a foreign land.;One of the greatest honors that any citizen of the United States can have is the privilege of wearing a uniform of his country. The greatest honor that the President can bestow upon any man who wears that uniform on behalf of this Nation is the Medal of Honor. They come few and far between. They are given only to the most gallant and the most courageous and the most dedicated who have demonstrated in battle their love for freedom and liberty.;Tonight, Mrs. Johnson and I are privileged to have among us the parents of a young man who wore that uniform and wore it with pride and distinction and who never had a chance to see that Medal of Honor because he gave his life in order that we might live-just as this man [indicating portrait of Lincoln ] gave his life in order to preserve the Union.;I think it would be quite appropriate and I would ask that each of you join me in standing and paying silent tribute to 2d Lt. Robert J. Hibbs of 316 West 18th Street, Cedar Fails, Iowa, whose father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Walter E. Hibbs, are our guests here this evening.;Lieutenant Hibbs was awarded the highest decoration this Nation can give posthumously on January 26, 1967, for service above and beyond the call of duty for us.;Mr. Hibbs, will you and Mrs. Hibbs stand, please.</td></tr>

Ambassador Bunker will be my guest while he is there, at the White House. I will be seeing him tomorrow. He will probably be returning Thursday.;We spent the afternoon hearing from Ambassador Bunker and going over a series of questions that we raised with him largely relating to the relationship between our Government and the South Vietnamese Government. We talked to him about what progress had been made since he had been there and what his general observations were.;His review was on the political front, diplomatic and economic front, very similar to what General Abrams and General Westmoreland and Admiral Sharp will go over with us on the military matters.;I don't know if this is the place for any extravaganza press conference, but I asked the Ambassador if he would point out some of the high points and give you his judgments for such consideration as you may care to give them or pass on to the American people on the situation there from a political and economic standpoint.;I think I need not recall to you that Ambassador Bunker is one of our most experienced and trusted and most highly regarded Ambassadors in the entire service. He has held a number of the most critical assignments that any Ambassador has ever undertaken.;His most recent assignment was the Dominican Republic, where he went and spent many months seeing a new government born and helping it through its early stages.;I thought I knew most of what was happening in Vietnam and felt very encouraged about the relationship between our Government and their Government and their people, but Ambassador Bunker's report today uncovered a lot of things that I had not realized or recognized or appreciated.;So maybe he will want to touch on some of those things for your general edification. Ambassador Bunker.;AMBASSADOR BUNKER. As the President said, I have come to report on the situation, as I see it, after Tet. If Tet was a psychological and a political success abroad, it certainly was a resounding military defeat for them in Vietnam.;I am beginning to think it was also a psychological and political defeat as well. It did create, obviously, many thousands of refugees and much economic damage. But there are other elements of strength which have developed and become evident there since the Tet offensive.;Although the Vietnamese forces, for example, many of them, were only at half strength, nevertheless with our assistance, they did smash the attacks. They inflicted very heavy casualties and drove the Communists from every city in the country.;The Government did not collapse, but turned to--with great will and determination-its recovery program. The ARVN forces did not defect. The people, after the initial shock, emerged strengthened in their anger and their hatred for Communists and their determination to resist.;The rate of volunteers for the forces rose dramatically. The Government is drafting 18- and 19-year-olds and has more than doubled the number of men it is going to take into the Armed Forces this year. Students are flocking to the gaining centers-certainly in a very surprising turnaround of attitude.;There is a new sense of danger, of urgency and patriotism taking hold in the country. The legislature is behaving in a responsible way. The President is going about improving the governmental administration and machinery, attacking corruption, and has replaced some 14 provincial chiefs since Tet.;Finally, I may say that Khe Sanh has not turned into another Dienbienphu. The news, as you know, has come in that the siege has been lifted. This will certainly have a very dramatic and favorable impact throughout South Vietnam.;So, I think the Government is much more self-confident than before Tet and there is much greater unity in the country today, I think, than we have ever seen before--a turning-to with the will. And I think it has made very substantial progress since this Tet offensive.;As you know, also, our forces now are on the offensive--our forces and the Vietnamese, throughout the country.;President Thieu is in the process of reorganizing the Government and making many improvements so that I am very much encouraged with what has happened there and look to the future with a good deal of confidence.;Q. May we ask some questions?;AMBASSADOR BUNKER. Yes.;Q. Mr. Ambassador, what impact psychologically has the possibility of talks looking toward negotiations had on the people and the Government? Are they disturbed by this or are they favorably impressed by it?;AMBASSADOR BUNKER. No, I don't think they are disturbed by it. Their position on talks, on negotiations, as you know, has been similar to ours.;Q. Mr. President, has anything new come in on what you told us about earlier today?;THE PRESIDENT. No.;Reporter: Thank you very much.</td></tr>

We had a third party attending most of our discussions. I am happy tonight to thank Mother Nature for bringing so much sunshine today to our meeting. The lovely weather today was a great relief to the people in the State Department.;You know, Mr. President, they are always so grateful over in Foggy Bottom, where our State Department is located, for even the very smallest ray of sunshine of any kind. But they also had a very special reason for being anxious about your visit.;The Secretary of State and the Chief of Protocol were just a little nervous. They thought they might have to negotiate with Mother Nature to arrange a very special reception for you, something that they thought would try to equal the spectacular show that you put on the last time an American President visited in your country.;I am told that when President Kennedy arrived in Costa Rica in 1963, a volcano erupted. If that had happened to me, Mr. President, I would have felt perfectly at home.;You have been in Washington now, Mr. President, for more than 10 hours. There are not many days when this political capital can go that long without some natural eruption. But we may still be able to put on a proper show for you. Later tonight we might pick up some tremors from a disturbance out in California.;Since I got out of politics, I don't know whose side Mother Nature is on out there, but she is certainly being courted by all of the candidates. One of them is praying for an earthquake to bury his opponent, one of them is praying for an upheaval, and a third candidate is just praying from a safe distance.;I understand, Mr. President, that Costa Rica has solved one of the problems of election campaigns that still troubles and vexes us here in the United States.;In your country the Congress appropriates funds to cover the campaign expenses of the presidential candidates. I believe anyone who gets 10 percent of the votes in Costa Rica is reimbursed in proportion to the number of votes he receives.;When Lady Bird was reading over the background book the State Department sent over, she looked up at me in the wee hours this morning and said, "Lyndon, you ran in the wrong country in 1964.;But the way things are going here in 1968, Mr. President, I expect some candidates may also recall what Will Rogers once said: "Politics has got so expensive that it takes lots of money," in this country, "to even get beat with.;The revolutionary times in which we live teach three lessons about the quest for freedom that we all cherish so much. They are not new, but because of recent events they have been given new meaning.;The first is that tyranny cannot suppress the human longing for liberty. This ancient truth remains as valid in the world of technology in the 20th century as it did many centuries ago when our common creed of freedom developed on the shores of the Mediterranean.;The second is that the defense of liberty sometimes carries a very heavy price. The people of South Vietnam and their allies know very well that freedom does not come free. I pray that the aggressors will someday come to understand the full depth of our resolve, as President Kennedy once said, to "pay any price, bear any burden... to assure the survival and the success of liberty.;The third is that democracy does not come in a single model. Each people knows how best to adapt the mechanics of representative government to the special needs of its people. We do not seek to impose a particular system. But we will defend the right of a people to determine their own destiny, free from coercion, and we are not fooled by false models.;Mr. President, your country, Costa Rica, and the United States differ in size. But they are equal in what really counts most--their love of liberty and freedom. That is the most cherished bond that unites the United States and Costa Rica.;The United States will never forget how quickly Costa Rica joined our cause after Pearl Harbor when we were attacked. We remember the prompt offer of ports and airfields during the terrible Cuban missile crisis. We remember that Costa Rican guardsmen stood shoulder to shoulder with our soldiers and those of the other American Republics to guard the peace in the Dominican Republic and to safeguard and to preserve the right of self-determination for the Dominican people.;I am particularly grateful to you, personally, Mr. President, for your always strong support, your strong moral support, in the defense of freedom in Asia.;Ladies and gentlemen, those of you who have come here from across the Nation to pay honor to this distinguished leader of our neighboring country, I should like to ask you to rise to toast the cause of liberty throughout the world and to toast one of its greatest champions, President Jose Trejos--teacher, scholar, statesman, citizen, and President of the sister Republic of Costa Rica.</td></tr>

In India food grain harvests jumped to nearly 100 million tons, 10 percent above the previous record.;--Total food output in the developing countries rose 7 percent, the largest increase on record.;United States economic aid played a major role in this Green Revolution. Our programs encouraged more effective farm price policies, helped to extend irrigation and establish farm credit systems, and provided technical assistance, fertilizer, pesticides and tools that farmers need to take full advantage of the new "miracle" seeds.;Many less developed nations are now establishing family planning programs. During fiscal 1968 the Agency for International Development committed $35 million to help them carry out these programs. This was nine times more than AID devoted to population programs during the previous year.;This report records the continuing concentration of American aid in relatively few countries where it can be most effectively used to help others help themselves. Fifteen nations accounted for 84 percent of total economic commitments by AID during the year. They were Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Korea, Laos, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam.;Another country, Iran, achieved self-support during the fiscal year and the United States AID mission there was formally closed.;Among the most helpful signs of our times are the breakthroughs being made by the less developed countries in food production, and the programs they have launched in the field of family planning.;It is our responsibility--and the responsibility of other more developed nations--to give their efforts firm support through our foreign assistance program. To do less would be to court catastrophe in a world growing smaller day by day.;LYNDON B. JOHNSON;The White House;January 1969</td></tr>

Ford: Veto of Legislation for the Relief of Alvin V. Burt, Jr., and the Survivors of Douglas E. Kennedy.</td><td class="c6">October 29, 1974</td><td class="c7">To the House of Representatives;I am today withholding my approval from H.R. 6624, a bill "For the relief of Alvin V. Burt, Junior, Eileen Wallace Kennedy Pope, and David Douglas Kennedy, a minor." I am advised by the Attorney General and I have determined that the absence of my signature from this bill prevents it from becoming law. Without in any way qualifying this determination, I am also returning it without my approval to those designated by Congress to receive messages at this time.;This bill would provide for payment, "as a gratuity," of $45,482 to Mr. Burt and for similar payments of $36,750 each to the widow and son of Douglas E. Kennedy for injuries and other damages Mr. Burt and Mr. Kennedy sustained as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted by U.S. military personnel in the Dominican Republic in 1965. The amounts in the bill were recommended in a congressional reference case opinion by a review panel of the Court of Claims.;The claims presented in this bill arise from an admittedly tragic and unfortunate incident. On May 6, 1965, Mr. Burt and Mr. Kennedy, two newspapermen who were covering the civil upheaval in the Dominican Republic and the peacekeeping operation in that country of U.S. military forces, attempted to drive through a U.S. checkpoint in Santo Domingo en route from rebel-held territory in the city. The Marines manning the checkpoint opened fire on their car when the men failed to get out as ordered and when it accelerated violently in reverse at the same time that the Marines were fired upon by snipers from an area behind the car. Both Mr. Burt and Mr. Kennedy were seriously injured as a result of the Marines' actions.;After the incident, both men received, without charge, extensive medical care and treatment from U.S. personnel in the field and later in U.S. military facilities. Their employer, the Miami Herald, paid their salaries while they were hospitalized, and guaranteed them continued employment. They also received workmen's compensation benefits during hospitalization, including prescribed lump-sum payments.;A majority of the members on a Court of Claims' review panel, which considered the present claims, held that the claimants had not established a "legal" or "equitable" claim within the meaning of the congressional reference statute. In fact, their opinion strongly suggests that the claimants' own negligence contributed to the injuries they received and further suggests that in pursuing their professions in the face of known hazards, the claimants assumed the risk of personal injury.;Notwithstanding these findings, however, the majority concluded that payment of reasonable compensation in this case was justified on "broad moral considerations" as a matter of "good conscience." Accordingly, they recommended awards in the amounts contained in the current bill.;I have considered carefully the merits of this case, and can find no reason to approve H.R. 6624. Equitable considerations growing out of Governmental actions have traditionally been the basis for private relief awards where no legal remedy is available. But the record clearly establishes that no such considerations are present in this case.;Approval of H.R. 6624 cannot, in my view, be justified by invoking terms such as "gratuity," as the awards are characterized in the bill, or "broad moral considerations," the basis used by the Court of Claims panel. To adopt such an approach could easily set a precedent for the payment of a myriad of claims involving financial hardship to selected individuals simply on the grounds that they lack legal redress. Once we start down this road, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to turn back.;I urge that in the future Congress adhere to the traditional equity basis for awards, whether or not they have been recommended by the Court of Claims under congressional reference procedures.;GERALD R. FORD;The White House;October 29, 1974.</td></tr>

Ford: Remarks in New Orleans at the Annual Convention of the Navy League of the United States.</td><td class="c6">April 23, 1975</td><td class="c7">Thank you very much, Mr. President. Governor Edwards, Senator Johnston, Representative Hebert, Representative Treen, and my dear friend, Representative Lindy Boggs, Mayor Landrieu, Rabbi Feibelman, Archbishop Hannan, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Chaplain Ray, merci garcon;Obviously, Governor, I am delighted and highly honored to be a good Cajun. Mr. Governor, you are also a good Cajun and have done very well in the political arena in Louisiana. Now that I am a good Cajun, I hope I am as lucky as you are. [Laughter];Well, members of the Navy League and your honored guests, it is a great privilege and a very high honor to have the opportunity of being here in New Orleans and participating in your 73d annual convention.;They say the Navy offers opportunity, and you had better believe it. In 1942, I became an ensign, one of those 90-day wonders. In 1943, I became a lieutenant. In 1945, I became a lieutenant commander. And in 1974, I became Commander in Chief. Now, you can't ask for any more opportunity than that. [Laughter];I do have to admit that being Commander in Chief of all of our Armed Forces does present me with one of several problems--in November, at the Army-Navy game, for example. I now have to spend half of the game rooting for the Army and half of the game rooting for the Navy. Fortunately, the late President Kennedy came up with the perfect solution to a somewhat similar problem. He was in Iowa just before their big game with Notre Dame, and someone asked him who he would be rooting for. John Kennedy said, "I will be rooting for Iowa." A tremendous cheer went up. Then he added, "But I will be praying for Notre Dame." [Laughter] So, come the Army-Navy game, I will let you figure out who I will be rooting for and who I will be praying for.;But there is a much more serious subject than the Army-Navy game that I would like to discuss with you for a few moments--the strength and the size of our merchant marine and our Navy. Both are as vital as anyone can imagine to our survival as a nation, and yet, both of them face very serious problems. But the problems are not insolvable.;In the case of the merchant marine, I have always believed in doing everything possible to keep the American flag flying over a large, modern, competitive merchant marine.;In Congress, I worked long and hard with many, many others to help pass the Merchant Marine Act of 1970. This very important legislation initiated a Federal program to improve the international competitive position of the United States merchant marine. Through this program, contracts will have been awarded by June 13 of this year for new construction or conversion of approximately 77 ships, with an annual funding of some $284 million.;Budget requests for construction subsidies will continue at approximately the same level in the next fiscal year. Expenditures for operational subsidies for United States flagships will climb--and, I think, appropriately--to a record high of $316 million. Our total Federal expenditures for Federal maritime programs--and bear in mind they are an integral, vital part of our total seagoing Navy--will be some $678 million as compared with a relatively smaller sum of about $500 million 2 years ago.;I give you my word that we will have a vital merchant marine in the future, and in the White House I will do as I did in the Congress, work for that objective for our national security.;While I am on the subject of our merchant marine, let me add my very strong personal congratulations to Paul Hall, president of the Seafarers' International for this wonderful award that he has received. 1 There is a man who believes in America, has fought for America, and will continue to be in the leadership in keeping America strong in the future. Congratulations, Paul. It is a wall-deserved tribute to a great union leader and a great American.;1 Mr. Hall received the League's Robert M. Thompson Award for Outstanding Civilian Leadership.;Our Navy also has entered into a time of challenge. Like the rest of our Armed Forces, its cost, even its purpose, is being questioned by many serious, sincere Americans, in and out of the Congress. No doubt some of this questioning results from our long and very tragic American experience in Indochina. No doubt, some stems from very understandable desires to spend money on plowshares rather than on swords, to put our resources into so-called social programs instead of into defense. But to keep America at peace, to enable us to make the kind of social progress we really want, we must keep America strong today and strong tomorrow.;One of those invaluable keys to achieving peace is a strong, modern American fleet. The Navy is still a very major instrument for resolving crises short of war. Its very presence in a trouble spot serves as a deterrent. It carries supplies, shows the flag, and provides a very flexible, but yet very powerful force that can help defuse tension in an area before it deteriorates into a crisis. It is a very vital part of our total defense establishment in peace as well as in war.;Let me put it in, if I might, even more concrete terms. Since 1958, our Navy and Marines have served in quick response to emergency situations 49 different times. The nature of the response, of course, varied from 32 cases in which it was a matter of showing the flag, to emergency interventions to protect American lives, property, and our national interest.;Let me give you several examples. In 1958, Navy and Marine units helped to restore order in riot-torn Lebanon and to protect American interests. In 1962, they enforced the quarantine on Soviet ships and helped to end the Cuban missile crisis. In 1965, they saved American lives and helped restore order in the Dominican Republic. In 1970, they helped to prevent disturbances in Jordan from erupting into another Middle Eastern crisis. And right now in Southeast Asia, Navy and Marine forces are standing by to assist in humanitarian relief and evacuation efforts, or to carry out any mission assigned to them.;Already, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Navy and Marines, particularly under their fine leadership of our Secretary of the Navy, Bill Middendorf, for their heroic efforts in evacuating Americans and a number of Cambodians from the beseiged city of Phnom Penh without casualties and without a hitch. It was a professionally planned and executed maneuver typical of what we have come to expect from our naval forces.;Historically speaking, it is very appropriate on this occasion to talk about seapower, for if America ever learned the importance of seapower, it was on April 23, 1814--161 years ago today. The War of 1812 was at its height and the British, backed up by their enormous Navy, decided on that date in 1814 to extend a blockade along the entire American coast. The small, weak, illequipped American Navy could do little to stop it. The British roamed the east coast almost at will. By August of 1814, we had even suffered the humiliation of an enemy attack on Washington, D.C., and the burning of the White House. We had been helpless to defend our own Capital City.;In the century and a half since 1814, we have been taught even more about the importance of seapower. Perhaps Teddy Roosevelt summed it up best when he said, "A good Navy is not provocative of war. It is the surest guarantee of peace.;Today, even more than in the past, America is dependent on seapower. This includes a strong merchant marine as well as a navy.;For one thing, we need free sealanes and the fast merchant ships to maintain the crucial flow of raw materials and energy to the United States. For instance, in 1974 alone, we imported more than 2 billion barrels of crude oil and refined products, accounting for about 36 percent of our total domestic consumption. Of this total, more than 90 percent was carried into this country in foreign bottoms.;It is my policy to reverse this dependence on foreign oil by making America energy independent. But for now, the facts are quite plain: American prosperity, perhaps even American survival, still depends on keeping the sealanes open, and only a strong American Navy can guarantee that result.;So, the obvious questions, quite frankly, are: What is the state of American seapower today? What will it be in the future?;Since 1968, the size of the Navy has been cut literally in half. Today, our fleet of 500 ships is the smallest since 1939, 2 years before Pearl Harbor. And it, unfortunately, is still shrinking. In fact, the Navy's active fleet will be down to 490 ships by June 30, 1976, 5 days before we celebrate our 200th birthday as a free and independent nation.;Fortunately, however, there is also a positive side to all of this. Today's U.S. Navy has some tremendous assets. Our aircraft carriers and their air groups are very potent weapons systems. These magnificent forces contribute immeasurably to making our overall strike forces the very best in the world.;Our nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear-powered surface ships are the finest in the world. We have more of them than any other power. The United States Marine Corps is unrivaled as a combat force. And the spirit and the morale of the Marines are as high as they have ever been.;In fact, the entire Navy-Marine Corps team has these very important, very vital ingredients: combat-proven strength, dynamic leadership, and dedicated professionalism. And we thank them all for these important assets that they contribute to our national security.;I have full confidence in the new professionals of our Navy and Marine Corps. But the Navy and the Marine Corps today are the results of careful planning of the days in the past. If both are to maintain the same high standards for the days ahead, we must be laying the groundwork right now. And we must take into account some dramatic changes in the global balance of power.;At the outset of World War II, America had a 3,000-mile ocean barrier on the east coast and a 10,000-mile ocean barrier on the west coast. A mighty British Fleet acted as a friendly buffer. And the United States had a 2-year lead time to gear up our great military production capabilities between the outbreak of war in Europe and our own entry at Pearl Harbor.;Today, we face a very different situation. For example, Soviet naval units now freely roam the world seas, circumnavigating the State of Hawaii in the Pacific, and operating in the Gulf of Mexico.;Let me give you a very graphic example, if I might, something that has happened within the past few days. Elements from all four fleets of the Soviet Navy have just completed global maneuvers. More than 200 Soviet ships deployed in all of the oceans of the world participated in this exercise. More than 50 Soviet ships were deployed in the Atlantic, extending their maneuvers to the Norwegian Sea and southwest of the British Isles. Soviet reconnaissance aircraft operating from Cuba and Guinea, conducted ocean surveillance over wide areas of the Atlantic. The Soviet Navy was also active in the Mediterranean, the Pacific, and the Indian Ocean.;There is no doubt about it, the Soviet Union understands the importance of seapower. The Russians built up their Navy while we permitted ours to shrink, and they know how to show their flag.;Unfortunately, the double blows of inflation and recession, along with other drains on Government revenues, are occurring at precisely the time that we should be putting more funds into more ships. As a consequence, Department of Defense expenditures in the next fiscal year will represent slightly less than 6 percent of the gross national product, the lowest point since the pre-Korean demobilization. In real terms, after making all of the adjustments for inflation, Defense Department spending has been cut almost 40 percent since the height of the Vietnam war. It is 15 percent below the pre-Vietnam level.;As a percentage of total government spending, including State and local, defense expenditures come to only 16 percent, the lowest point since before Pearl Harbor.;As for our human resources, today only 1 percent of America's population is under arms. Our military manpower is actually nearly 600,000 below the pre-Vietnam level.;However good their intentions, those who claim that America is overarmed and overspending on defense are wrong. It is my very deep conviction we cannot afford to cut any further without endangering our national security. While our own military spending has been declining, others have not been idle. The Soviet Union, for example, is outspending us on defense by at least 20 percent.;As far as the Navy is concerned, the budget that I have submitted to the Congress for the next fiscal year requests $3,100 million to build 23 new ships and an additional $2,300 million to restore full funding to our shipbuilding account of previous years.;I deeply believe that the vast majority of our citizens today want to maintain American sea, land, and air forces that are second to none. Let it never be said that our generation allowed American seapower to erode into a second class status. Let it never be said that we permitted our merchant fleet to disappear by attrition.;Only a strong America, an America strong of will, strong of purpose, can be an effective force for peace in a troubled, modern world, and a strong navy and merchant marine are essential to a strong America.;I pledge to you that I will continue to work with all of you, and literally thousands like you, for the kind of America that has been good, not only for us but for all mankind. And I will ask for your help in pursuing this vital goal as we move ahead in the days and the months before us.;Thank you very, very much.</td></tr>

And from everything I understand, the intention is to continue.;But my feeling is that first we have to have a person who is very qualified in the law, as such. On the other hand, I don't think you can exclude certain classes of individuals because they don't happen to be a practicing lawyer. We have some very knowledgeable people in the law who might have other current occupations. So, they have to have a competence, a very high competence in the law, but that doesn't mean they have to be restricted within a certain framework in a very limited sense.;Now, they have to be a person of great integrity. I would hope it could be someone in a relatively middle-age group, because I think continuity on the Court is a matter of importance.;I wouldn't want to make any commitment as to ideology. I don't think that is necessarily something that you can tell precisely, and I wouldn't want to preempt anything in this area by any comment I make at this time.;EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT;[2.] Q. Mr. President, do you think you can match your wife's ardent support of the equal rights amendment?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I voted for it in the House of Representatives. I can't do any more than that.;Q. Would you do one more thing--[handing the President a button]-would you take this back to Betty Ford? "A woman's place is in the world." [Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. She has been doing quite well lately--[laughter]--for which I am very proud of her.;CHILE;[3.] Q. Under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, the United States attempted to help achieve the violent overthrow of the Governments of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Chile. We would like to know under what circumstances your Administration will participate in the violent overthrow of Latin American countries. And I would like to know why you have not spoken out against heinous abuses of human rights in Chile and sought to bring pressure to bear on those who do?;THE PRESIDENT. I wouldn't want to indicate that our Government is going to interfere with the internal operations of any government anyplace in the world. I think it is a matter that has to be carefully considered in the context of how it relates to our own national security. And to even imply that this country is going to get involved overtly or covertly, I think, is a mistake for the President of the United States.;I made a comment the other day--to show how sensitive the subject is--I was asked a question about the situation in India, and I said it was sad and added a qualifying phrase. It created, apparently, some great stir in India.;So, it is a very sensitive subject, and I just don't think I should discuss it.;Q. Do you rule out the United States ever again participating in the overthrow of another country?;THE PRESIDENT. I would not want to rule it out or decide otherwise. It has been done apparently in some cases in the past, but I don't think a President should--in this very sensitive area--make any commitment one way or another.;CHARTER ON ECONOMIC RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF STATES;[4.] Q. Mr. President, I was just wondering what your reaction was to the introduction of the economic charter by President Echeverria in the United Nations?;THE PRESIDENT. As I recall, Senator Chuck Percy, who is our representative at the United Nations, led a very determined fight against it--and I have great respect for Senator Percy--and Senator Percy, I know from personal conversations with him, was extremely well prepared in meeting the proposal that President Echeverria made, or was made on behalf of him at the United Nations. And as a result of Senator Percy's strong feelings and well-documented arguments, the United States was one of a limited number of nations that voted against it. He was acting for the United States. I was President, so I support him.;THE MIDDLE EAST;[5.] Q. Mr. President, my question relates to a commitment to Israel to, I guess, discuss the possibility of providing them with the Pershing missile. In this morning's paper, I guess, you are quoted as commenting from Los Angeles yesterday, I believe, that you don't presently know whether or not the Israelis possess the nuclear warheads that can be carried on these missiles. My question is that before we would make a commitment to give them these missiles, is this something that we would undertake to find out? And if it turns out they do presently have these warheads, would we still give them the missiles?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, the basic shopping list that was submitted by Israel is a very extensive one. They want substantial arms aid, including some very sophisticated weapons systems, and the Pershing missile and the F-16 are among those listed. In the case of the Pershing missile, the language, the precise language in the agreement simply says we will study whether or not Israel has a justification for the acquisition of that particular weapons system. I am certain that we will, in the process of studying this, cover the whole range of its deployment, its warheads, and everything else.;Q. Is there any justification now for giving the Israelis a nuclear capability?;THE PRESIDENT. We have no present intention of us giving to any Middle East nation any--;Q. Any means to develop?;THE PRESIDENT. We have no present intention of giving any Middle East nation a nuclear capability, and that would include, of course, any expertise for the development.;VIOLENCE IN AMERICA;[6.] Q. Mr. President, in your address you mentioned a very brief and violent period of American history not too long past now. The news media has recently focused our attention again on a very violent extreme political group. Why do you suppose it is that a society such as ours fosters groups committed to violence in a political form?;THE PRESIDENT. I am bothered about that. I honestly don't have the answer. I would welcome any observations or recommendations from all of you as to why, in a society where I think by any other standard that I have ever observed-and I have traveled in a good many countries--we should have violence, and in some of those far more oppressive societies don't seem to have any. If you have any solution to the problem, I would welcome such observations.;Q. Mr. President, on that subject, perhaps when people are less inclined to trust the legal system, they may think of looking elsewhere in making their own law, which perhaps is where the violence comes from.;THE LEGAL PROFESSION;[7.] Q. On the subject of giving all the people of this country some kind of legal ability to get legal help, it seems that there is very little chance now, that people coming out of law schools who want to do public interest law, want to give legal aid and public defense, can find a way to do that. It is very difficult to get a job in the law now anyway, but especially in those fields, and I was wondering what your Administration proposes to do to expand those kind of--;THE PRESIDENT. I signed the basic legislation which set up the new legislation, and I have appointed, or nominated--have they been confirmed yet, the nominees?--the organization that will, I think, give greater opportunities for young lawyers or other lawyers to participate. As a matter of fact, I recommended for the first year's budget about $81 million, which is, as I recollect, a slight increase over the existing amount, or the previous amount that had been made available for the effort under the old setup.;I hesitate to refer to my own experience, but there was a great challenge when I got through Yale Law School. I had an opportunity to practice in several eastern cities, but it was a greater challenge to me to go back and open up a law office with another young law school student--and we didn't have a client. We worked about 14 hours a day, and we actually made our expenses the first year. It was one of the great experiences of my lifetime. I think that is a great challenge. You ought to try it. [Laughter];PROBLEMS OF THE CITIES;[8.] Q. My question concerns what has been termed the crisis of our large cities. And one of the manifestations of this crisis are the recent problems we are having in Boston and other cities with busing for quality education. Now, it seems to me that one of the problems behind quality education in our big cities is that the big cities lack the finances or resources to provide that quality education.;Now, education is only one facet of this crisis. It also goes into the other social systems--transportation, communications, recreation within the cities. I don't recall hearing any programs recently by this Administration, the past Administration, about reversing this--what I would term a spiral downward of our big cities--to correct that problem. Because if we don't correct the problem in the near future, killing the cities will thereby lead to a worsening of life in the United States, if you want to use a broader term.;But with the exodus of people in cities going out to the suburbs, what you have is that the people in the cities just get worse, and the financial structure will deteriorate, the job structure will deteriorate. So, do you have any present plans or any future plans to maybe reverse this trend?;THE PRESIDENT. First, I think I ought to set forth a record you may not be;familiar with. In 1971 or 1972 the Congress passed--on the basis of the then administration's recommendation--what we call general revenue sharing, where $5-plus billion a year goes directly to cities--two-thirds to cities and local units of government and one-third to the States, free, without any strings or limitations.;That is a very substantial commitment, and about 2 months ago I recommended its extension, with $150 million a year added, so that in the first year of the second program--the second 5-year program--the annual amount will be about $6,250 million a year that just goes to those cities and to those local units of government and to those States, free of any limitations.;So, they did get a real shot in the arm for financial resources from the Federal Government to meet some of these local problems. Plus in the field of transportation, last November, December, I signed an $11.5 billion transportation act. And without getting into the details, I had a significant impact in getting the House and Senate to reconcile differences and to make that available. And this is primarily a mass transit act aimed at major metropolitan areas. Well, there are other programs that I think have sought to help and assist major metropolitan areas, New York City included. And just in passing, New York City last year in all its Federal programs, all of them, got $4,300 million from the Federal Government. We have not neglected New York City.;Q. Mr. President, I realize there are the various programs that you have just mentioned. But it seems in my view that the amount of resources that have been devoted to the cities require a much more substantial amount than the programs you have just outlined, because the cities are large, the problems are massive and should be tackled, and must be tackled in a systematic, organized, manner. I gather from what you are saying is that you think that the programs that you have outlined--and maybe some others you haven't right now--are sufficient to tackle the problem at this current stage?;THE PRESIDENT. I think so. It has been my general feeling that just the massive piling on of more money to cities doesn't necessarily solve the problems. The programs have to be well worked out, coordinated, and I think there is a fair assumption, a basic assumption I make, that the Federal Government ought not to try and determine how those cities meet their local problems. We do make substantial contributions financially, but the actual stimulation of new ideas to meet their problems ought to come from those communities.;With citizen participation in the housing act last year--where we went from an old housing program of about seven or eight categorical grant programs where we had urban renewal, Model Cities, a whole bunch of them--what we did was to eliminate the categorical grant programs, give them the same money. We had a hold-harmless provision in that law so they all got at least no less than they got before. And we said, now you get this money, you have community hearings--and every city is required by law to have community hearings--so that the people make recommendations to their local authorities for the expenditure of this money.;Now, in the communities that I am personally familiar with, I think the expenditure of that money is far better today under that kind of a system than under the old categorical grant program, because each city is different, each city has problems that are unique to it, and the people give the recommendations to the locally elected officials--they spend the money. All we do is audit that it's honest. And we ought to have enough genius in each local city or local unit of government to come up with good programs. And I think we can, but it has only been in operation a year.;Q. Mr. President, it is time to head outside.;THE PRESIDENT. Can I take one more here?;Q. We would like to make sure you have this before you go, sir. It is a petition signed by over 200 students here. 1;THE PRESIDENT. Fine, I will read it. And let me take one more question.;1 The petition listed certain policies of the Ford Administration with which the students disagreed.;SCHOOL BUSING;[9.] Q. You have expressed publicly your feeling that busing to achieve equal education is not the preferred way to achieve that goal. What suggestions do you have for attaining the goal of equal education for all children?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there are a number of Federal educational programs that are aimed at helping local communities in a very broad sense. But the one that is aimed specifically at meeting the problem of those communities that are under court order or under HEW administrative requirement for the current fiscal year--if my recollection is accurate--it is about $250 million.;In the case of Boston precisely, in the last year, out of this fund, the Boston school system has been given something over $4 million to be aimed directly at trying to assist in upgrading the school system in Boston--meeting the challenge. And in addition, we have had the top person in the Federal Government-HEW--Dr. Goldberg, 2 who has gone up to Boston to try and work with the local officials in Boston to meet their unusual and difficult problems.;2 Herman R. Goldberg, Associate Commissioner for Equal Educational Opportunity Programs.;I really believe that this is the approach that ought to be taken. You just don't throw the money up there. You try to take the money and utilize it in an effective way as to student opportunities, student facilities, organization, et cetera.;I think a lot of things can be done, including the list of things that are set forth in the Education Act of 1974, called the Esch amendment, that are a better approach than the ones that have been used in a number of cases by the courts themselves.;Thank you very, very much.</td></tr>

Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, ma'am?;Q. Tell us all about it.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, we have an extremely good relationship with the Dominican Republic, as you know. President Balaguer has set an example for all leaders in this nation in changing his own country and his own people away from a former totalitarian government to one of increasingly pure democracy. And the commitment that he's shown in preserving human rights and leading the other nations in this effort have been an inspiration to me.;I doubt that any other two countries have worked more closely together in matters relating to our own hemisphere, in the United Nations than has the Dominican Republic and the United States of America. We cooperate on the sugar agreement. We cooperate in our debates in the General Assembly of the U.N. We cooperate in matters that relate to the Organization of American States.;We've been talking to President Balaguer about the upcoming elections next year, which will be open and free and, I think, which will be a model to everyone on the universality of the right to vote and the free expression of the people's will in choosing their own government.;So, in the last 7 years, there's been unbelievable progress made in the Dominican Republic. President Balaguer pointed out to me that there's a great need for us to realize that their major crop, their major export item is sugar, and what we do here in our own country has a profound impact on the well-being of his own people.;And of course, we hope that we'll have an international sugar agreement during 1977. We produce tremendous quantities of sugar in our own Nation from sugar beets and cane. And of course, we also import large quantities of sugar.;So, these discussions, particularly with him and with the other nations, are very important to me.;Q. When do you think the Senate is going to bring up these treaties, and are you confident of the result?;THE PRESIDENT. I'm going to do the best I can to have the treaties ratified. And I think that we will succeed. But the time schedule is something that I can't predict right now. It's going to be a matter of great importance to me and to our country and to this hemisphere, and I think a failure to ratify the treat), would have very, serious consequences.;Q. The Hill leaders are saying it won't be 'til next year. Do you accept that that's probably what will happen?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, that is, I think, a guess at this point that would be good. But I've talked to the leaders on the Democratic and Republican sides, and if it seems apparent that we have enough votes to ratify the treaty during this session of Congress, they've all assured me that that would be their desire.;Q. Don't bring it up if you don't have the vote.;THE PRESIDENT. That's right.;Q. What do you mean by "serious consequences"? You've said that several times now. Do you mean war?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, no, I wouldn't want to predict war. But I think it would be a serious disappointment on behalf of all the nations of this hemisphere in the refusal to ratify the treaty by our country. I don't, obviously, predict war. But there would be a deterioration of the relationships between our country and almost every nation south of here.;Q. Do you see your own relationship to other foreign policy questions tied to your success or failure on this particular one?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, to some degree, yes, because it tests the character and the will of the American people to do what's fair, what's right, what's decent, and to treat other nations with respect, and at the same time to enhance the security and well-being of our own people. And I think it would be a reflection on our judgment and our fairness if the treaty was not ratified.;Q. And if it is ratified, do you then have a better hand in the Mideast, on SALT, on other questions?;THE PRESIDENT. I think my own position would be enhanced in that it would be a show of support for my administration by the Congress and the people, yes.</td></tr>

Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you very much for coming to the White House to see us. Bill [William Shipp, Atlanta Constitution], how are you doing? How are things in Atlanta?;What I'd like to do just for a very brief period of time is to outline a few of the items that are involved in my duties, both in the Congress and internationally, and then answer your questions.;ADMINISTRATION POLICIES;We've lately been trying to deal satisfactorily, and within the complete bounds of the law, with the question of Zaire and the invasion of Zaire by Katanganese who came in from Angola.;We have a very limited role to play there. We are involved in providing some logistical support for removing, because of humanitarian reasons, some of the nationalists-nationals who are located in the Kolwezi area. The French and Belgians, with the support and participation of the Mobuto Zairian Government, are attempting to evacuate those nationals whose lives are endangered. We are providing support only in the noncombat zone. The nearest approach, I think, to Kolwezi by our airplanes is about 200 kilometers.;This would be a limited involvement. We've consulted very closely with the Members of Congress, and I'm sure that it will be successful.;We've also been approaching the Congress on some other foreign policy matters this year. Two major ones that have already been resolved are the Panama Canal treaties and the sale to the Mideast countries of arms.;We've also decided to ask Congress to terminate the Turkey arms embargo, which I consider to be a crucial decision for the strengthening of ties between Greece and NATO—between Turkey and NATO, between Greece and Turkey, and to help us resolve the Cyprus issue.;We will be preparing—I've spent a lot of time preparing for a NATO conference here, the last days of this month. It will be much broader in scope than previous NATO conferences. The heads of the nations will be here with me, around this very table at times, and will analyze the long-range thrust of the NATO defense agreements and resolve some issues that have arisen among us and which ordinarily are addressed through bilateral conversations between me and other NATO government heads of state.;Congress is dealing with the budget and with the energy question. We hope that we'll have an early resolution of the natural gas pricing and deregulation proposal which has been the most difficult issue of all. That will still leave the question of the crude oil equalization tax, which is to be decided by a separate committee, at least from the Senate point of view.;We have civil service reform proposals now in the House and Senate. As far as legislation goes, I consider this to be the most important issue in reorganization effort. We're trying to make the bureaucracy and the Federal Government more responsive and more manageable.;As I've said several times, it's much worse than I thought it was before I got here. [Laughter] And I think that to give very dedicated career civil servants an opportunity to do a better job and to be rewarded when they do a good job, and also to encourage those who aren't performing well to perform better, to give our managers authority among the personnel, civil service, will be a major step in the right direction. This is in the Post Office and Civil Service Committee in the House, and the Government Operations Committee in the Senate. And we are spending a lot of time getting ready for this vote, which I hope and expect to be favorable.;We've got many other issues at stake. I think in order to save time, since I came in here a little bit late, I'll answer your questions, and then address more directly those questions that are very important to you.;I might say, before I take the first question, that I have enjoyed being President. [Laughter] It's a full-time job, I've discovered. But there are pleasant working conditions, as you can see. I don't have to ride very far to get to work. I think it's kind of brought our family together. Rosalynn has been an equal partner with me in many ways. And she's presently involved to a major degree in building up volunteer work in the improvement of the quality of life in our communities, around the country, of all sizes. She's studying Spanish and has made two or three trips to Spanish-speaking countries to the south with great effectiveness, I think.;And I've got a superb Cabinet. There's not a single member of my Cabinet that I would want to change. And my hope is all of them will stay here as long as I'm in the White House. I've got a good staff, solid.;So, I've enjoyed the job, and I never got up out of bed yet that I didn't look forward to the day. Sometimes I've been disappointed after I got up. [Laughter];QUESTIONS;YURI ORLOV;Q. Mr. President, may we have your personal reaction to the trial of Yuri Orlov in the Soviet Union?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. The State Department, with my approval, has issued a statement on this subject. We are deeply disturbed about this action by the Soviet Union, which in my opinion subverts the spirit of the Helsinki agreement concerning human rights. Orlov was a Soviet citizen who organized a group to monitor compliance with the so-called third basket in the Helsinki agreement, which was signed not only voluntarily but with a good bit of publicity on the part of the Soviet Union.;We are concerned about the severity of the sentence, the secrecy of the trial, and the apparent abuse that Mrs. Orlov suffered during the conduct of the trial. We've expressed our concern in clear terms to the Soviet Government.;NUCLEAR POWER;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I haven't paign, you said that nuclear power should be America's last energy resort. When and why have you changed your position?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I haven't changed my position. I always made it clear when I said that, that our first emphasis ought to be on conservation. Our second emphasis ought to be on saving oil and natural gas, which are getting very rapidly depleted and the production of which in our country has been going down steadily and inexorably, I think, that we should increase our production of coal and renew an effort to encourage additional use of solar power, cut down on imports, and to the extent that all those efforts are not successful, we ought to make up the difference with atomic power.;But I always made it clear and still feel that there is a significant role to be played by nuclear power.;I was involved to some degree in evolution of peaceful nuclear power uses, and I know that in some parts of the country, like around Chicago, about 50 percent of the total power comes from nuclear plants. I'm very interested in TVA. I'm going to be down in TVA, the national headquarters, on Monday.;Six plants are being prepared for construction in the TVA program. I support this. We've tried to expedite the licensing procedure, but at the same time do all these other matters which I think would minimize the need for nuclear power.;Q. Isn't more of the research money still going into nuclear power than such things as solar and geothermal?;THE PRESIDENT. No. Compared to what the Congress has authorized previously, we've had a substantial increase in other forms of energy, as far as the budget is concerned, on research and development. I think for the first time now, we've gotten nuclear power research and development down to less than half of the energy budget.;But I think, as you probably have noticed, there's a much more fervent commitment to some very wasteful projects, like the Clinch River Breeder Reactor, in the Congress than I have. I would like to terminate the Clinch River Breeder Reactor and have tried to, and the Congress has so far overridden my objections to it.;I do think we ought to continue to keep open the option of breeder reactors. And we have a very heavy allotment of funds available for research and development in that field. But to tie down a specific design and start constructing an operating plant now when we do not need it, I think, is a very large and unnecessary waste of money.;EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT;Q. Mr. President, Congress is currently struggling with the difficult issue of, if the equal rights amendment is fair, is the extension of ratification fair. What's your opinion?;THE PRESIDENT. I strongly favor the passage of the equal rights amendment—;Q. What about the extension of ratification?;THE PRESIDENT. —-and I hope that it passes. If it becomes obvious that it wouldn't pass, then I would favor the extension of the law.;Q. Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, Bill.;CUBAN AND SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN AFRICA;Q. Is the United States responding in any way to the continued Soviet-Cuban adventures in Africa? Are we doing anything to discourage that specifically?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think you probably know that the Congress placed very tight constraints on the President and any initiatives that can be taken, in the aftermath of the Vietnam war and the aborted effort to move into Angola after they got their independence from the Portuguese.;I favor a lot of those constraints. The War Powers Act suits me fine, where the President cannot initiate military action without consultation with the Congress. I think this is good.;But within the bounds of the present law, which we are honoring rigidly, we are doing all we can. One of the real needs is to have more public support for foreign aid programs. I don't know of any issue that has less political support than that program itself, foreign aid in all its forms.;The Soviets and the Cubans are quite eager to provide military weapons to any group in a country where they might see a foothold there opening for them in the future for increased influence. And the Soviets are very eager to send Cuban troops, actually to be involved in the fighting. And the Cubans respond without reticence.;In order to meet that challenge, we depend upon our own voice to express our concern to the Soviets through my own public statements, through private correspondence between me and Brezhnev, through diplomatic channels, through the voices and influence of our allies around the world who want to see an absence of military action and outside interference.;We try to strengthen the Organization of African Unity and prevail upon the black leaders of Africa that the issues in that continent can be best resolved by leaders who live in Africa. We have tried, since I've been in office, I think in an innovative way, to increase our own routine involvement in Africa, not just go in there at the last stages after a crisis has occurred.;I received overwhelming welcome, for instance, in Nigeria, whereas a few years ago—3 years ago, I think—the Nigerians refused to let Secretary Kissinger come into their country. And I think whereas Kaunda, who's here now from Zambia, has been highly critical of our Government and our policies in the past, now he's very supportive and very constructive.;We are trying to honor the legitimate demand of black Africans for their own voice, on an equal basis with other citizens in the shaping of government policy and the election of their own leaders and in the determination of their own future, their own destiny.;Majority rule, one person, one vote principles that we espouse so fervently here in our country, we are trying to espouse those same rights in Africa. To the extent that we fail to do that, it opens up an avenue for enhanced intrusion by the Soviets and the Cubans on a default basis.;We are working much more closely in harmony now with European leaders. For instance, in settling the Namibia question, we have a five-person committee working under the aegis of the United Nations-ourselves, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany—who are dealing directly with the South Africans and directly with the SWAPO organization. We have combined our efforts with the British in trying to resolve the Rhodesian question fairly, with open elections, free, so that any person can participate who chooses, and where the same basic form of elections can be held as are held here and in Great Britain.;We work with others who are interested in peace in Africa. The Saudi Arabians have been very helpful in providing some nonmilitary aid when countries get in bad economic circumstances. We are trying to help nations that have a one-commodity export dependence, like the Zambians with copper, and so forth, to have a much more stable market, better reserves.;So, in every possible way, on a peaceful basis, we cooperate with nations in need so they don't have to turn to the East, to the Soviets and through their surrogates, the Cubans, for help.;We are watching with great interest and concern now the degree of Soviet involvement in the internal matter in Ethiopia concerning the Eritreans. The Cubans, for instance, claim to be a nonaligned country. It's obvious that they are not nonaligned. They are the most heavily dependent and subservient countries that the Soviet Union, which I am aware of, certainly outside the Eastern Bloc itself. And we point this out frequently when we have visitors here from, say, Romania, or from Yugoslavia. We point out that military presence of the Cubans in Africa is inimicable to peaceful progress and is an unwarranted intrusion.;So, through all these matters we try to meet that challenge on a nonmilitary basis. We have a limited ability to supply defensive weapons to those countries, under very tight constraint from laws that control my actions, and we take advantage of that. So, those are some of the things we are doing, Bill, that I think are adequate.;I might make one other point that I made in Spokane the other day, and that is that in the long run we have an advantage, because I think we have a much more natural affinity for and compatibility with the black people of Africa than do the Soviets. They know that in the long run their economic well-being, democratic principles, basic human rights can be better guaranteed through a relationship with the Western democracies than with the Eastern totalitarian countries. And in many instances those leaders in Africa are deeply religious people, and they have some reluctance about affiliating themselves with the atheistic governments of Cuba and the Soviet Union. Those are some of the distinctions that are drawn between us and them.;NATURAL GAS DEREGULATION;Q. Mr. President, I'm from an oil- and gas-producing county in Texas. I wonder what the outlook is for the energy policy and deregulation of natural gas?;THE PRESIDENT. I think at this point it looks much better than it has in months. We've seen the two committees, two conference committees, the House and Senate, being almost exactly equally divided. As you know, the Senate committee, when it began to confer, was divided 9 to 9. And the unfortunate death of one of the committee members is the only thing that relieved the tie.;We've had the House committee conferees recently divided, I think, 13 to 13. And I know we've needed 13 votes to prevail. We see a prospect of step-by-step deregulation of natural gas at a rate of the inflation plus 4 percent, to be completed in early 1985 with, I think, adequate protection for consumers. And this would round out the fourth major element among the five in our comprehensive energy package. The one remaining, as I said, would deal with oil pricing.;So, I think at this time the prospect for success in the conference committee is very good. It's the first time I've been able to say that in 13 months.;DOMINICAN REPUBLIC;Q. Mr. President, what, if anything, has been a new development in the Dominican Republic vote?;THE PRESIDENT. There have been three very distinguished citizens there who were invited in to monitor the outcome of the election and the proper procedures used, headed by Galo Plaza, who's a former executive secretary of the OAS—Secretary General. I understand that they are now on the way back to OAS headquarters.;We have expressed, through diplomatic channels and publicly, our deep concern about the interference in the electoral process by the Dominican Republic military. We've been assured repeatedly by Balaguer, the incumbent President, that the votes would be counted and counted honestly and that he would abide by the result of the election. Our impression is that the military does not want Guzman to be elected President. They want Balaguer to stay in office. And the military are the ones who have interfered.;If it becomes obvious to us, after we analyze the procedures used in the election, that the will of the Dominican people has been subverted by illegalities or unwarranted interference in the democratic election process, this would have a major effect on the support that we would give to the future Dominican Government, and my guess is that we would turn then, also, to the Organization of American States for a thorough investigation of what did occur there.;We are quite concerned about this-we, the Venezuelans, the Colombians, the Costa Ricans, and others—because we believe so deeply that democracy must-be improved among the nations of Latin America on their own initiative. We're not trying to interfere in the internal affairs of another country. But there are four other nations who presently are committed to democratic elections in the future, who now have military governments in varying forms. And I think if we should have a demonstration in the Dominican Republic, which is a very good democracy up until now, that those principles don't prevail, it would have an adverse effect on the entire Southern Hemisphere.;So, we are deeply concerned about it. We'll do all we can without interfering directly in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic to let our concern be felt in a beneficial way.;PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA;Q. Is this country about to establish full diplomatic relations with Mainland China?;THE PRESIDENT. We don't know yet. Ever since President Nixon's highly publicized visit to the People's Republic, we have lived under the so-called Shanghai Communique commitments. I have reconfirmed my approval of those agreements, which do call for a normalization of relationships with the People's Republic of China.;Dr. Brzezinski is not going to Peking to negotiate normalization. He's going there to exchange ideas, to try to build up a better relationship between ourselves and the People's Republic, to enhance trade, to search out mutual interests that we have around the globe, and to let there be a better understanding between us and the people of Mainland China.;We recognize under the Shanghai Communique that there is one China. We insist that any differences between Taiwan and the Mainland be resolved peacefully, and we don't know yet with what degree of success the move toward normalization can be expedited. We just don't know yet.;RELATIONS WITH THE CONGRESS;Q. You mentioned earlier that reforming the civil service had been more than you anticipated.;THE PRESIDENT. No, I said that the problems in the bureaucracy had been more than I anticipated.;Q. Has your education in dealing with the Congress been similar?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I've had a good relationship with the Congress. I think when this term is concluded, for instance, and an inventory is made of what achievements we've realized, there will be a recognition that my relationship with the Congress has been very good. We've had some very difficult issues that we've addressed, some highly controversial matters and some hot debates, and some failures, of course.;But, for instance, the natural gas deregulation question has been one of the most controversial ever addressed by the Congress. I think the first natural gas deregulation bill was vetoed by Harry Truman, I think, in 1950 or so. For 30, 35 years, this has been a difficult matter to resolve.;I'm not saying flatly that this one will be resolved this year. My anticipation is that it will. But I think that if you look back a year ago on what were the most controversial questions, it was whether or not I would have the authority to reorganize the Government, whether or not we could form an Energy Department, whether or not we could have success in a comprehensive energy policy evolution hi our country, or whether or not we could deal with the most crucial issue then, which was unemployment.;Since then, because of the action of the Congress in concert with me and my administration, we've added a net increase of 5.5 million jobs in this country, an unprecedented achievement, and the unemployment rate has dropped 2 percent.;Now the Congress and I, because of changing economic circumstances, because of an unanticipated success in the employment field, are much more deeply concerned now with controlling inflation than we were before. The inflation rate this year has built up more rapidly.;But I have an excellent relationship with the Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate. We have meetings here over in the White House, every 2 weeks at least, with a complete group of Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. This past Tuesday morning, we had the Republicans and Democrats together. And so, I have been pleasantly surprised at the relationship that I have had with the Congress.;MR. WURFEL. Thank you, sir.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you all very much. I'll answer one more question, and then I'll go.;SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION;Q. As I understand it, you proposed to reduce the number of soil conservationists in the Nation and cut funds for certain programs. In my State of Iowa, I understand it could be possibly 50. Are you going ahead with those cuts?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. With the Soil Conservation offices, is that what you said?;Q. Conservationists.;THE PRESIDENT. Conservationists, oh. I don't know. We are trying to evolve now, approaching a final decision on basic water policy. And as Governor of Georgia, I've seen some very serious abuses in the Soil and Water Conservation Service. I understand that in the Midwest and the West, the same conditions don't prevail.;In Georgia, for instance, the abuses that I tried to correct, I think successfully while I was in office, was the unwarranted draining of freshwater wetland areas, which is highly costly, utilizes channelization, destroys the environmental protection for wildlife and game. I won't outline all the advantages there, but primarily the result is to reward financially the landowners who bought the property, knowing that it was a wetland and who want to have it changed into productive farmland at government expense when we have an adequate supply of farmland in Georgia.;Another problem in some of our mountain regions was in the design of dam structures in some of our smaller mountain streams, where the type of discharge raised the temperature of those mountain streams 10 to 15 degrees sometimes and therefore destroyed all the wildlife below the dam which had formerly been indigenous to that area.;So, I think the establishment of a good water policy will help to resolve those questions. But specifics on how many persons would be discharged, I'm not familiar with that at all and don't know of any plans to do that.;Let me say, again, that I appreciate you being here. And I would like, if you don't mind, for you to come by and let me have a photograph made with each one of you. It would be a pleasure for me.</td></tr>

These treaties symbolize a fundamental respect for sovereignty and a cooperative spirit which can motivate all countries to address the difficult problems which affect all the world.;They believe that the Panama Canal treaties demonstrate how all of us can work together in a new spirit of cooperation to shape the future in accordance with our ideals and to resolve all areas of friction in the region by peaceful means. They are determined to build on this example so that attention can be focused on economic cooperation and integration in order to promote socioeconomic development and thereby strengthen solidarity among the peoples of the Americas.;Accordingly, they pledge to work actively and in cooperation with each other and with other states.;To promote world peace, they pledge;—To work to bring into effect the Treaty of Tlatelolco banning nuclear weapons from Latin America and the Caribbean.;—To strengthen the peacekeeping machinery of the Organization of American States and the United Nations.;—To work toward an effective regional limitation of conventional armaments based on cooperation among suppliers and purchasers to put an end to their acquisition for offensive purposes. They are deeply concerned about the waste of resources to purchase arms and are therefore encouraged by the decision of the countries which signed the Ayacucho Declaration to renew their determination to find a new agreement to limit purchases of weapons. They also hope that the Ayacucho example will be expanded to include all Latin American countries, and perhaps to other regions as well.;—To use their good offices and cooperation to encourage the solution of international disputes and to reduce areas of tension in the hemisphere. They hope that the patience and mutual respect which led to the successful negotiation of the canal treaties will help countries to resolve such problems and points of controversy in a mutually helpful way.;—To consult on a regular and continuous basis on a wide range of international issues in order to reduce the differences between national policies and increase the likelihood of reaching mutual agreement.;To promote greater respect for human rights and to widen the scope of international action in the defense of human dignity, they pledge;—To strengthen the autonomy and capabilities of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.;—To work to bring the American Convention on Human Rights into effect in this year, the 30th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The leaders viewed with sympathy the offer made by Costa Rica for San Jose to be the site of a proposed Inter-American Court on Human Rights, conscious of the advantages of this site.;—To speak out for human rights and fundamental freedoms everywhere and to work to eliminate repression.;—To facilitate the development of conditions that would promote democracy with popular and effective participation. In particular, they express gratification that the will of the people of the Dominican Republic was freely expressed in elections last month, and they reiterate their hope and understanding that the electoral commission in the Dominican Republic will adhere faithfully to the integrity of the democratic process.;—To work through international organizations to strengthen the juridical foundations of political, social, and economic rights.;To move forward toward a more just and equitable international economic system and to insure that ongoing multilateral negotiations, including those on the Common Fund and debt, are pursued expeditiously with the goal of bringing concrete and significant results for the benefit of all countries, particularly for the developing countries, and to help raise the living standards of the world's poor, they pledge;—To help alleviate hunger and poverty by emphasizing food production and studying the implications of rapid population growth.;—To complete the work of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations in Geneva and thereby reduce trade barriers and increase the participation of developing countries in an improved world trading system.;—To seek ways to improve the efficiency, growth, equity, and stability of commodity markets, and to seek to bring into effect the International Sugar Agreement, the International Coffee Agreement, and other commodity agreements which will have the purpose of establishing fair prices for the products of developing countries.

By Proclamation 4334 of November 16, 1974, the President modified Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202, hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS") to establish, effective January 1, 1975, following expiration of the Sugar Act of 1948, rates of duty and a quota applicable to sugars, sirups and molasses described in items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS. The President subsequently modified the rates of duty by Proclamation 4463 of September 21, 1976, Proclamation 44-66 of October 4, 1976, and Proclamation 4539 of November 11, 1977.;2. the President took these actions pursuant to authority vested in him by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including section 201 (a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2)), and in conformity with Headnote 2 of Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, hereinafter referred to as the "Headnote." The Headnote was part of a trade agreement which embodied the results of the "Kennedy Round" of international trade negotiations. That agreement is known formally as the 1967 Geneva Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the agreement includes, as an Annex, "Schedule XX," a schedule of United States trade concessions made during those negotiations. This agreement was concluded pursuant to section 201 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a)), and was implemented by Proclamation No. 3822, of December 16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455) which, inter alia, added the Headnote to the TSUS.;3. The Headnote provides, in relevant part, as follows;(i)... if the President finds that a particular rate not lower than such January 1, 1968, rate, limited by a particular quota, may be established for any articles provided for in item 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall proclaim such particular rate and such quota limitation,...;(ii)... any rate and quota limitation so established shall be modified if the President finds and proclaims that such modification is required or appropriate to give effect to the above considerations,...;4. Section 201 (a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act authorizes the President to proclaim the modification or continuance of any existing duty or other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of that Act, except that pursuant to section 201 (b) (2) of the Act, the President may not by proclamation increase a rate of duty to a rate more than 50 percent above the rate existing on July 1, 1934.;5. I find that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of the quota applicable to items 155.20 and 155.30 of the TSUS are appropriate to carry out the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, and that portion of the Kennedy Round Trade agreement set forth in the Headnote, and as provided for in the Headnote, give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.;Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America. acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and in conformity with Headnote 2, Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1, of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until otherwise superseded by law;A. Headnote 3 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the TSUS is modified to provide as follows;(3) The total amount of sugars, sirups, and molasses described in items 155.20 and 155.30, the products of all foreign countries, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any calendar year shall not exceed, in the aggregate, 6,900,000 short tons, raw value. Of this quantity, not more than 210,987 short tons, raw value, the product of the Republic of China, and not more than 150,544 short tons, raw value, in the aggregate, the products of all foreign countries other than Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Republic of China, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Fiji, Finland, German Democratic Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, Swaziland, Sweden, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia, may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption in the period between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 1979, inclusive. For the purposes of this headnote, the term "raw value" means the equivalent of such articles in terms of ordinary commercial raw sugar testing 96 degrees by the polariscope as determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. The principal grades and types of sugar shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner;(i) For articles described in item 155.20, by multiplying the number of pounds thereof by the greater of 0.93, or 1.07 less 0.0175 for each degree of polarization under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion).;(ii) For articles described in item 155.30, by multiplying the number of pounds of the total sugars thereof (the sum of the sucrose and reducing or invert sugars) by 1.07.;(iii) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish methods for translating sugar into terms of raw value for any special grade or type of sugar for which he determines that the raw value cannot be measured adequately under the above provisions.;B. The provisions of this proclamation shall become effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after the date of publication of this Proclamation in the FEDERAL REGISTER, except that articles which were released under the provisions of section 448(b) of Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)) prior to such date shall not be denied entry.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.;JIMMY CARTER</td></tr>

First of all, let me say that I'm very glad that you could come and meet with me this morning. I think we've probably delayed this kind of breakfast excessively, and if it works out well, I'd like to do it on not a schedule, but a basis as determined by you and Jody.;PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO GUADELOUPE;I will be going to Guadeloupe on the 5th and 6th of December [January], taking only one staff person, meeting with the President of France, the Chancellor of Germany, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. We'll be there for 2 days, we presently plan. And I think all four of us will be taking our wives. It'll be somewhat of a social affair, but we'll be discussing substantive issues.;I don't think there'll be any press conferences during that time. I think we'll just meet privately and discuss the broadest gamut of questions that affect us all.;This is a group that has met periodically, even before I became President, during the economic and other summit conferences, because we are directly related in the administration of Berlin and we have found the private meetings to be very helpful. And at the last meeting, when we were at Bonn, we all decided to explore this possibility, sometime during the late winter, to meet.;So, we will be going there on the 5th and 6th of December.;Q. Of January?;THE PRESIDENT. The 5th and 6th of January, I'm sorry.;Q. Will there be press briefings, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know yet. I think that they will be minimal, if any, John [John Osborne, The New Republic]. We'll only be there 2 days. I think we'd like just to go and have a chance to meet in an unstructured way. There will not be any agenda prepared ahead of time, and we'll take one staff person. We have got a lot going on in Washing- ton, and I've tried to think about the staff person that could easiest be spared. If you have any suggestions for me [laughter] -;Q. You can take Jody?;THE PRESIDENT.—-I'd appreciate it. That sounds like a good suggestion.;QUESTIONS IRAN;Q. Mr. President, we appreciate this breakfast, and I'd like to ask a question that I might not pose at a broader meeting. As a former Democratic Member of the House who voted for you and who spent 2 years at our embassy in Iran, I find it a little difficult to reconcile your statements about the Shah's concern for human rights, democracy, and liberalization with the pretty well documented record of his regime.;I think that those of us who have been there—and I'm going back tonight could accept your policy a little better if you were to postulate it on the broader strategic and energy considerations. I'm wondering if you could enlighten us on that, both points, and anything else on the issue.;THE PRESIDENT. I'll try.;There are several basic premises on which our relationship with Iran is postulated. First of all, our bilateral relationships with Iran have been constructive for both countries. We consider the Iranian people's relationship with the West to be very important. Iran has been a stabilizing factor around the Persian Gulf. This stability is valuable in the region. It's valuable in the surrounding territory, reaching certainly as far as Israel and the Mediterranean, and it's important for world peace. Iran has been very helpful to us in economic matters concerning OPEC, and we have a good and longstanding relationship between Presidents—myself and my predecessors—and the Shah himself.;The Shah has attempted, in my opinion, while maintaining order in a very difficult period, to move toward social liberalization, sometimes directly in conflict with the desires of the more traditional religious leaders, and has on several occasions, increasingly, lately, offered to form coalition governments encompassing his political opponents there. These offers have been rejected.;I don't have any apology to offer for the difference in human rights values that our own Nation espouses and those that have been accomplished by the Shah in Iran. There have been abuses. There have been incarceration of people without formal charge and trial under the Shah's government that would not be acceptable in our own country.;But I think the trend has been, under the Shah, toward democratic principles and social liberalization. Some have thought he moved too fast, some have thought he has moved not long enough-not strongly and rapidly enough, rather. And, of course, there have been instances when human rights violations have occurred as measured by any objective standard. But I might hasten to add that we have those kinds of violations in our own country as well.;Q. Mr. President, I was going to ask you about the Shah. Do you think he could survive now, and how?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. I hope so. This is something that is in the hands of the people of Iran. We have never had any intention and don't have any intention of trying to intercede in the internal political affairs of Iran.;We primarily want an absence of violence and bloodshed, and stability. We personally prefer that the Shah maintain a major role in the government, but that's a decision for the Iranian people to make.;Q. Do you think there's still any chance that he'll form a civilian coalition government?;THE PRESIDENT. I think he has offered that publicly. And as you know, yesterday, I believe, he released two of his top political opponents. And I think, I would guess, surmise, that one of the reasons for those political leaders being released was to encourage them and their followers to join in some form of coalition government. That's the Shah's desire that's expressed to me personally by him and through his own Ambassador here, and I take him at his word.;EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI PEACE NEGOTIATIONS;Q. Mr. President, how important is it, do you feel, for Israel to accept a definite target date—by the end of next year, for example—for the transfer to Palestinian autonomy, how important to accept a target date, as opposed to a more general commitment that we will try to bring autonomy as soon as possible, how important in terms of bringing Palestinians into the process, bringing King Hussein of Jordan into the process? How critical do you feel is the issue of persuading the Israelis to accept a definite target date for transfer to autonomy?;THE PRESIDENT. I should make clear that the United States does not have a unilateral position that we try to force or even encourage the Egyptians and Israelis to adopt. Any mutually acceptable agreement which could be concluded between the Egyptians and the Israelis would be satisfactory to us.;My concern, however, is that we would like to see the Camp David accords carried out, first of all, completely. I think any violation of the Camp David accords would set a very serious precedent which would cast doubt upon the present treaty which is being negotiated.;We would also like to see the Camp 1)avid accords carried out, not grudgingly, but enthusiastically, in the same spirit that we saw exemplified in the White House when the accords were signed. This has not been the case during the negotiations. There have been unwarranted delays, quibbling over what seems to us to be insignificant language differences, and excessive public statements on both sides that have made the negotiating process excessively difficult.;We have made a proposal to the Israelis and Egyptians of a peace treaty text plus a separate letter which would endorse a definite timetable on the establishment of the self-government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Israelis adopted the peace treaty text after they had previously rejected some of its component parts, and did not adopt the crucial and integral additional letter with few features in it, the most significant being the timetable. The Egyptians consider that the timetable is a mandatory element of a future;Success.;I'd like to add one other thing: If the Egyptians and Israelis violate the 3-month limit on negotiating this treaty, it will be a very serious matter to us and, I think, to them. That's why I am sending Cy Vance to Egypt, and perhaps then to Israel. If, because of mutual lack of agreement, we go past December 17, it would cast doubt on whether the Egyptians and Israelis would carry out the difficult terms of the upcoming peace treaty, and it would set a precedent that would have far-reaching, adverse effect.;So, we consider the December 17th date to be very, very important, perhaps at this point more important than Prime Minister Begin or President Sadat. I'm going to make that clear to both leaders during Secretary Vance's trip.;But, to summarize by repeating my first statement, we don't have an independent position. Any mutual agreement between the two nations that leads to peace and a peace treaty would be satisfactory to us;Q. May I just follow that up, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. Would you consider the establishment of four new settlements on the West Bank to be a violation of the Camp David agreements?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I would.;My interpretation of the Camp David agreements—and, as you know, Prime Minister Begin disagrees with this interpretation-is that there was a moratorium on the establishment of new settlements until the agreements had been reached on how to establish the autonomous government in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. I had never connected in my own mind or in my conversations with either leader the cessation of settlement construction as it related to an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty concerning the Sinai. It was always connected in my mind and in the original versions and text of the proposals to be connected with the conclusion of discussions on how to establish the modalities and procedures of establishing the elections, self-government in West Bank, Gaza.;I might say I don't want that to be an obstacle to the Egyptian and Israeli progress. But that's my own personal opinion, and that's my recollection of what occurred at Camp David. It's the only extant difference, and it's already been explored in the press.;APPOINTMENTS OF FEDERAL JUDGES;Q. Senator Harry Byrd of Virginia sent you the names of white males for the judgeships there, and when he set up his commissions, he had several white males, one white female, and one black. The blacks did present some names, but the commissions rejected them.;Since that time, the civil rights organizations of Virginia have considered some black names to fill the judgeships. Are you going to consider those black names, or are you going to acquiesce to Virginia's all-time historical policy of never even considering a black for Federal judgeship?;THE PRESIDENT. I have, practically speaking, a great deal of influence on the selection of circuit judges, those above the district judges. And I've established Merit Selection Commissions to recommend to me a balanced list of well-qualified people when every vacancy occurs, and those are, in effect, under my control.;Because of the ability of any Senator to prevent the appointment of a district judge in his or, now, her State, the district judgeships have to be a partnership agreement between the Senators and the President. Either the Senator or I can, in effect, veto the appointment of a judge.;As we have received lists of judges, judge nominees, from the Senators—and they don't come to me, they come to the Attorney General—if they don't encompass women and minority groups, the Attorney General is asking the Senators to reassess their procedures and to broaden the list to encompass women and minority nominees, so that I can have that opportunity for my own selection.;We are proceeding with that aggressively. In some instances, there have been, since this legislation has been pending for so long, there have already been some commitments made by the Senators themselves. I think there have been 18 or 20—I've forgotten, I don't keep up with the list, but it's been growing—of the Senators who have established district or State selection commissions. And I hope that this will continue.;I'm not prepared to comment on an individual State. I have not seen the list, have not been involved in that at all in, you said, Virginia. But my influence will be used to the maximum degree practical in encouraging Senators to cooperate with me in appointing both and recommending both women and blacks, other minority groups, for those district judgeships.;Q. Could I follow that question up, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. I wanted to follow up on that a minute.;Senator Byrd has said that he is not going to reconsider anything but what the commission has passed to him—and I do want to congratulate you on setting up these commissions that are formed at the State level—but he has said he's not going to consider any other names.;THE PRESIDENT. I understand.;Well, I might say that if something of that kind cannot be resolved, then there would be no appointment in Virginia, because the way the Senate operates—and this is not my preference—Senator Byrd could tell the Judiciary Committee that any Senate nominee was unacceptable to him, and the Senate Judiciary Committee would not act. That's the present prospect.;But we hope that as the process is demonstrated to be feasible, that—I'm not commenting specifically on Senator Byrd, I'm not familiar with his recommendations yet—but we hope that there will be a growing inclination on the part of the Senators to act in good faith and to accommodate my policy of broadening the appointments.;Q. Mr. President, would it be unfair to have you comment on any number, any specific number of minority or women Federal judges you expect to appoint in that 152 number? You know, that was the figure that was publicized as being the number of slots that you intend to fill, and, of course, you specified that you want minorities and women. But have you formulated in your own mind any estimate as to how many of that 152 would half be adequate in your estimation, less than half?;THE PRESIDENT. I'm not prepared to answer that question. I don't know. It's not a question of fairness, I just haven't made those decisions yet. The only thing I can say is that I think one of the recent legal journals—I don't know the name of it, I think I sent a copy of it to Jody-assesses what I have done already in that respect. You are welcome to look it over. And, of course, whenever I make a decision on judicial appointments or on the Federal budget or anything else, my action is subject to public scrutiny and public condemnation if I don't perform well. I do the best I can. Sometimes my authority is limited.;If I didn't have to get Senate confirmation of appointees, I could just tell you flatly that 12 percent of all my judicial appointments would be blacks and 3 percent would be Spanish-speaking and 40 percent would be women and so forth. But that's not a matter that's entirely in my hands. I'll do the best I can. And if I fail to satisfy you or others, then I'm certainly a good target for criticism or condemnation. I'll try to avoid that prospect.;WAGE INCREASES FOR PUBLIC OFFICIALS;Q. Mr. President, the first big challenge to your wage and price guideline program seems to be coming not from the Teamsters or one of the other big unions, but from some public officials of Illinois and Ohio at the State and local level. I'm wondering how important you consider that these pay increases be rolled back to the future of your program—in other words, whether smaller people down the line can be expected to adhere to the guidelines if the public officials don't adhere to them?;THE PRESIDENT. Certainly they're important symbolically. I think it's also important that I express myself very clearly through Alfred Kahn 1 or personally when I believe these salary increases violate the standards.;1 Advisor to the President on Inflation.;There are extenuating circumstances in some instances. For instance, the city of Chicago has a constitution which prevents any change in a city administrator's salary, elected official's salary, for a 4-year period, and any change in the salary has to be made before the next election so that the public can, in effect, approve the salary increase. Mayor Bilandic called me yesterday afternoon, very concerned about the altercation, and he is sending his city budget officer, I think today, to meet with Alfred Kahn or his people to work out a reasonable resolution of this question.;I think obviously some of the increases proposed have been excessive, but if they can justify the reason for it, if it's an increase that encompasses, say, an 8-year mandatory period of time, and if the change is made prior to an election, where the people that make the change can be condemned or removed from office by the populace, that certainly is an extenuating circumstance.;I'm not trying to comment on percentages or numbers. I'm not familiar with them. But I think it's a very serious challenge.;I might add one thing—not even parenthetically-that we don't have any authority over a city government or a State legislature. There's a limited amount of action that we can take even indirectly. We can't cut off humanitarian funds to a city or to a State, for instance, or cut off highway funds simply because the legislature votes to raise its own salary. But within the bounds of my authority, or practicalities of it, we consider this to be a serious challenge, and we are trying to meet it. I think my own statements last Friday and Fred Kahn's statements since then demonstrate that that's a fact.;MIG—23'S IN CUBA;Q. Mr. President, I was looking over the transcript of your answer at the last press conference on the presence of MIG23's in Cuba, and I'm not quite clear what exactly our intelligence does show with regard to those warplanes. And I wonder if you could answer whether or not we have any indication that there is even one nuclear-capable MIG down there? I'm not talking about whether or not there are any nuclear weapons down there, but whether or not there is a MIG that is capable of carrying nuclear weapons.;And secondly, your answer also seems to imply, the remarks about assessing the quantity and quality of such systems, that if there were perhaps only one or two, that that in itself might not constitute a violation of the '62 understanding we have with the Soviets. And I wonder if you could also comment on that, whether or not just one or two might be okay, but more than that might not be?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think it's obvious that there are planes in Cuba that can carry an atomic weapon if they are outfitted to do so, designed specifically to do so, and if the crew is trained to do so. There are many relatively small, commercial-type jets that have a physical capability of carrying a nuclear weapon, which in this modern technological age can be relatively small in weight. But I think that's as far as I want to go with my answer.;You know, the physical capability of picking up that much weight, carrying it to the shores of the United States and dropping it, is certainly there. But whether the planes are outfitted to do it, designed to do it, crews are trained to do it, is an entirely different matter, and we don't have any indication that this is the case. But we are continuing to monitor that circumstance, and act accordingly.;Q. Is there some sort of numerical mix or some sort of formula that we have worked out in our minds beyond which we would consider it a violation of the '62 agreement and under which we wouldn't consider it? In other words, if they just had half a squadron or only a couple of planes, well, you know, it's perhaps trouble, but it's not something we're going to call them on?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, there would certainly be a numerical mix that I can't describe and don't have in my mind now that we would consider in violation of the 1962 agreement. And the 1962 agreement was certainly very unclear on this. The technology and the capability of airplanes, almost all the extant airplanes then, have been modified or replaced, and there would be a mix of quality and quantity. Even if I knew, I wouldn't broadcast it publicly. There might be at that time of crisis, which does not presently exist, a difference between ourselves and the Soviet Union, but I don't think I could define it any more clearly.;The Soviets have assured us that they still stand behind the 1962 agreement, have not violated it, and I think my answer at the press conference was carefully worded. And I think it's adequate.;NICARAGUA AND SOUTHERN AFRICA;Q. Mr. President, I was going to ask you about the MIG's also, but I'll switch my question around to South Africa and Nicaragua— [laughter] —both places where the United States has had deadlines in concert with other countries to try and bring about some sort of settlement. In both places the deadlines have come and gone, and in both places you are working behind the scenes to try and bring about some kind of peaceful settlement.;Could you start with Nicaragua, and tell us what progress you're making with [President] Somoza?;THE PRESIDENT. We've got a little time. Let me tell you something in generic terms, general terms, that apply to all these efforts.;We don't have to be involved in trying to bring peace to Nicaragua, to Nigeria, to Rhodesia, to Cyprus, to the Mideast, but it's a voluntary responsibility assumed by us. It's in the best interests of the American people. It's certainly in the best interests of those people who are faced with expanded conflict. It's in the best interests of world peace.;The prospects for resolution of all these very difficult questions are sometimes quite undetectable or remote. They're certainly not a sure thing. We have been persistent and, as a nation, sometimes courageous in injecting ourselves into a thankless responsibility to try to induce reluctant adversaries to cooperate and to maintain or to enhance peace, sometimes even to conclude a final agreement that might be permanent in nature.;We're making some progress, I think, in Nicaragua. When we entered the Nicaraguan conflict, blood was being shed, massive violence existed. We tried to induce and were successful up until now in getting other American nations to join in with us, the Dominican Republic, and Guatemala, to get Somoza for the first time even to agree to an outside arbitration group to resolve the differences between himself and his political adversaries in Nicaragua, to stop the violence, to restrain the shipment of arms into Nicaragua to both sides, and to provide peace between Nicaragua and her immediate neighbors.;At that moment several months ago, I think the prospect of Somoza accepting any sort of plebiscite would have been very remote. He has agreed to a plebiscite under certain restraints. My understanding the last few hours is that his opponents have now tentatively agreed at least to those plebiscite terms. A lot of negotiation still needs to be done, but we are making progress.;And in the meantime, we have shifted-I don't say we've done it alone, but we have helped to shift the Nicaraguan circumstance from active and massive bloodshed and violence into a negotiation on the details of a democratic plebiscite, that would be monitored by the United Nations or by the OAS, that would decide on the future government of Nicaragua. We don't know that we'll be successful, but I think that in itself is progress.;The same thing applies in Rhodesia and certainly to a greater and perhaps better extent in Namibia.;Q. Have you been getting positive feedback on the Namibia situation in the last day or so?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. I think the prospects for Namibian progress were dismal 2 weeks ago. With the Namibian election plan, which is now under way—I think the final results of it, it takes about 4 days to hold an election, first one they've had in a long time—the Secretary General had asked the Prime Minister of South Africa to take full steps—which I don't know have been revealed publicly, and I'm not going to reveal them this morning. The South Africans were very reluctant to accede to the Secretary General's request.;I invited Pik Botha, the Foreign Minister, to come and meet with me privately. I urged him to accept the importunities of the Secretary General. He went back to South Africa, talked to Prime Minister Botha, Pieter Botha, and they agreed to accept the Secretary General's request.;Q. They did?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. This has been a kind of a one-sided proposition. Now, of course, the next step is to go to SWAPO and see if they will accept the present terms. There's nothing certain about it.;Our hope is that this elected body in Namibia will be looked upon as an interim step, and that South Africa will retain responsibility for dealing with the United Nations, that United Nations force will be put into Namibia to supervise future elections that would probably take place over, after 5 or 6, maybe 7 months, that the United Nations force will be patently fair and objective, and that the free expression of all the people who live in Namibia be felt in the establishment of a new government, with SWAPO and the Turnhalle group represented in accordance with a majority vote and one-person-one-vote, majority rule. These are the things that we hope for.;We've had less success in Rhodesia. Although the bloodshed has been more than we would want, it's been much less than could have been the case. ! think the British retain primary responsibility there from an outside point of view. We've joined in with the British at their request.;Now there's another effort being made more exclusively by the British. We are participating in this. They're exploring the possibility or getting the four powers together under some framework, and we don't know what the outcome will be. In the meantime, we're trying to encourage all of them to minimize bloodshed and violence and move toward, again, majority rule, one person-one vote, free expression for the will of the people in Zimbabwe, as it will be named, and let anyone who wants to run as a candidate do so. These are the kinds of things we want to do with the United Nations, retaining peace there.;But we can't guarantee success in any of these instances, including the Middle East or Cyprus. But we're doing the best we can, and I think to some degree just stabilizing the situation and continuing the negotiations is constructive.;I'll try to keep my other answers briefer.;BILLY GARTER Q. Could I shift gears, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Please.;Q. About 6 weeks ago your brother appeared before an Atlanta grand jury that was investigating the Lance affair. And he later told reporters he'd invoked the fifth amendment two or three times and said—I don't know what his—there are various interpretations of his mood at the time—but he called it a Republican, Yankee-inspired investigation. Have you any general reaction to this, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. Not that I would like to express. [Laughter] I might say that I promised the American people that I would stay completely aloof from my own business and so forth. I have never discussed this with Billy, although I talk to him frequently about other things, but he understands my commitment. And any dealing with Carter's Warehouse, from my point of view, is done by Mr. Kirbo, and he'll make any statement that's appropriate. But I don't care to comment on it.;Q. Could you comment on his taking the fifth, sir?;THE PRESIDENT. No, I don't care to do that, either.;I've read the news reports, and Billy's explanation was that he was asked by the grand jury to bring the records for a certain date, a period of time, and that when questions were asked of him about financial details outside that period of time, he refused to answer because he did not have the documents with him. But I've only gotten that from the press. I've never asked either Kirbo or Billy about that.;U.S.-MEXICAN RELATIONS;Q. Mr. President, could I ask you about the Mexican policy that you have under development now? I understand you want to discuss immigration and some other things that have to do with our dealings with the Mexican Government. Can you tell us a little bit about how that's progressing and what you hope to accomplish?;THE PRESIDENT. Yes. In preparation for my visit to Mexico in February, the National Security Council has been assessing all the facets of our Mexican policy-political, economic, and so forth. We began this during the visit of President Lopez Portillo to our country. He was the first foreign visitor that I ever had. And we set up kind of a task force from the Commerce Department, the Treasury Department, the Attorney General's office, and Defense and Agriculture and so forth, and they have met at the sub-Cabinet level, at the Assistant Secretary level on several occasions to explore potential progress between ourselves and Mexico.;I consider our relationship with Mexico to be as important as any other that we have, and my relationship with President Lopez Portillo has been very good.;We've also had negotiations with them earlier this year on the purchase or pricing of natural gas and, perhaps, eventually oil, as those fields are developed. Because of the uncertainty of congressional action on the energy legislation, they were postponed, with agreement on both sides, until after the Congress adjourned. Those will be recommenced, and I would guess we'll do some background work on that before I arrive in Mexico to conclude, hopefully, these continuing negotiations.;I think that pretty well encompasses what we are doing at this point on Mexico. It's of very great importance to us. There'll be a great deal of staff work and Cabinet-level work between now and February in both nations, and I hope that my own visit with Lopez Portillo can conclude successfully these negotiations on a wide range of subjects.;STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION;Q. Could you tell us, Mr. President, about what progress is being made and what the prospects now are towards a SALT agreement? And I wonder if, without attempting to hang you up on any more predictions, you will have one to discuss at Guadeloupe in January?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know—I doubt if we will have a final agreement to go over with the other European leaders in Guadeloupe, but we will have the SALT proposals that we have in almost final-our proposals, probably, in final form, when we get to Guadeloupe, and an accurate description to the other leaders of the remaining differences, if any, at that time.;I might say that we keep other leaders, certainly including Schmidt, Callaghan, Giscard d'Estaing, briefed very well on the progress of SALT negotiations on a continuing basis, either with direct secret messages from me to them, sometimes on a nonclassified basis in private telephone calls between me and them, and so forth. As you know, many facets of the SALT II agreement apply directly to the European theater, and, as we prepare for SALT III, this has a much more direct effect on the European theater.;I have been pleased recently with the progress being made on SALT. The remaining differences are minor, compared to what they were a year ago, and in my own mind I can see a way to resolve them. If the Soviets are adequately forthcoming, I would guess that any further delay would be minimal.;Q. What steps, say between now and then, can you anticipate in the way of contacts, meetings, and discussion between ourselves and the Soviets?;THE PRESIDENT. I think an almost inevitable progress would be to continue to define the narrowing differences. And there's been steady progress, there never has been a time when we retrogressed on SALT. Then I think there would be a preparation period for a summit meeting, certainly at the Foreign Minister level, between Secretary Vance and Gromyko, and possibly others, and then a summit meeting between myself and Brezhnev, whenever he and I agree there would be a reasonable opportunity for success.;I think because of their attitude, which I have assessed over the last—almost 2 years, President Brezhnev's inclination is not to have a summit meeting unless there is a sure conclusion of SALT in prospect. But I would like to have, if he should come over here, a 4- or 5-day period where we might discuss a broad range of agenda items and not narrowly focus it just on military items. And of course, that would require very careful preparation.;I can't give you any further information. I don't know anything about dates. It's still just a general outline of how it might go about. But that's my present thinking.;PRESS SECRETARY POWELL. About one more question here.;THE PRESIDENT. One more question? All right.;TAX-EXEMPT STATUS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS;Q. Mr. President, the IRS has a plan to penalize schools that desegregate by taking away their tax-exempt status. I wonder if you could comment on whether you favor that plan, or if you do not, what alternative do you think the IRS has, or anyone has, to get these Christian schools and other schools to desegregate?;THE PRESIDENT. I'm not familiar with a new IRS plan. You may know that I come from Georgia— [laughter] —and at the time of the civil tights legislation, a lot of schools were set up with the real purpose of circumventing the civil rights laws, which accepted students on a racial basis. At that time, the IRS passed some very restrictive rulings or interpretations of congressional acts or laws that prevented contributions to those schools from being included for tax benefits.;So far as I know, those rulings still apply, and they are very restrictive on the schools in my own area.;Q. They're holding 4 days of hearings right now on a plan that would require schools that are under court order to desegregate, i.e., private schools under court order to desegregate, or schools that have already—how do I phrase it?—that have already—I can't think of the other part of it, I'm sorry. Anyway, the schools that-Oh, I know, schools that set up around 1970, or when court orders in their area, public schools to desegregate, those schools would have to prove that they are having financial arrangements for minority students, and things like that.;THE PRESIDENT. I see. I don't know how to answer that question-;MR. POWELL. Mr. President, I think that that matter is in Treasury. It has not come to the White House at all, even at the staff level, I don't believe. I think I know what you're talking about, but it is at this point completely within the operation of the Treasury Department.;THE PRESIDENT. That probably—since I'm not familiar with it, it'd probably be better for Jody to look it up, talk to me, and then give you an answer. I don't know.;ANTI-INFLATION PROGRAM;MR. POWELL. Let's take one more here from Mr. Deakin [James Deakin, St. Louis Post-Dispatch]. I know you want to talk about inflation a little bit.;Q. You haven't really been asked a question about inflation—I mean, here we are—walk out of here without it. I was struck by something you said at your last press conference.;You were asked whether it wasn't really the case that if we are going to have a real attack on inflation in this country, really do something about it, the American people weren't going to make up their minds to pause in this expansion of expectations, this ever-rising standard of living. And your answer, as I heard it, was pretty much, no, we didn't have to pause like that, we can have our cake and eat it, too. That's what came across to me.;THE PRESIDENT. I might say I don't remember that question, or that answer. But go ahead. [Laughter];Q. It was at your last press conference.;THE PRESIDENT. I remember the press conference. [Laughter];Q. You were there, that's right. So was I.;I'm just wondering whether you really think that. I was struck, for instance, by what seemed to me to be a conflict between that and your whole approach to the energy problem at the beginning, when you were saying, in effect, this country had to cut back on its greed for energy and its sort of wild consumption of energy.;Do you really think, that we can have our cake and eat it, too? I'm talking about the question of sacrifice. Do you think you can sell the American people and have them believe in your inflation program without a major sacrifice?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't think so. I've said many times that the American people are going to have to sacrifice, and my responsibility, within the limited authority that I have, is to balance that sacrifice among the various groups.;No one here can imagine how difficult the last 2 or 3 weeks have been for me in the preparation of the 1980 fiscal year budget. It is a traumatic experience to try to reach the goal that I very carefully set for myself of reducing the deficit, imposing restraints from the Federal Government level as a needed step and also as a guide or example for others to emulate.;I will be judged, when the budget is revealed, as to whether I've done it fairly and objectively and have met my commitments. I intend to do so. But it is a tight budget, and there are going to be inevitable outcries from those who expect to continue things as they have been going in the last few years.;So, I think that the public is fairly well attuned to, as you say, a pause. At the same time, I don't believe we're going to have a recession or a depression. The rate of growth will certainly be much less than it has been in the last few years, when we've had 6 or 7 percent growth rate.;We have some demonstrations of what I say. I think anyone who reads the speech that I made to the National League of Cities would say that it was a very disappointing-type speech from the perspective of mayors expecting increased handouts or generous Federal Government policies in economics. But the response among the mayors, I think, was very supportive of me, both at the time I was there and their subsequent comments to the press.;So, I think that the sacrifice is inevitable. It ought to be reasonably shared. I'm going to persist in setting an example from the point of view of the Federal Government to control the deficit. And when the budget's revealed I think there's going to be a general conviction among the American people that the sacrifice will be imposed as I've described.;Q. Specifically, what you were asked at that press conference, Mr. President, was whether or not the American standard of living was going to have to—the level was going to have to pause.;THE PRESIDENT. I think the answer to the question was whether it was going to;Q. You said no, that the standard of living would continue to go up. Can we really have a successful campaign against inflation if the American standard of living-we are, after all, victims of our own standard of living—continues to go up?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, you know, I don't want to predict exactly what's going to happen. My belief is that the American standard of living can continue to go up, that the standard of living, however, is not measured simply by the rate of growth of our national product. I think the standard of living is determined by many things: the assurance of peace, stability, the strength of families, the quality of education, the enhancement of basic human rights, harmony among dissident groups.;This will certainly continue to improve. I think that we will not have a recession. We will have a rate of increase of growth in the national product that will even include additional economic benefits, but how fast the GNP grows will be less than it has been in the past.;But I don't think the American people are looking toward a life that's more dismal or with less hope, nor with less quality. But if you measure quality only by how fast someone's income goes up, then I think there is going to be a difference in the future, compared to what it has been in the past.;I haven't given you a very good answer, but it's the best I can do.;Well, let me say I appreciate a chance to meet with you and discuss subjects in more depth. I've taken more time to answer your questions this morning than I would at a press conference. But if you all think that these kind of sessions are beneficial, talk to Jody about it, and I'd be glad to do it additionally in the future.;I thank you all very much.;REPORTER. Thank you, Mr. President.;MR. POWELL. Let me ask, before everyone gets away, if you would, we're making this announcement on the Guadeloupe trip right away. If you didn't mind just holding onto that, particularly the wires, for just a few minutes, let me walk in there and make that announcement. We did it here so you'd have a chance to explore it in a little more depth. I was glad to see that you availed yourselves of that gracious opportunity. [Laughter] If you don't mind doing that, I'd appreciate it.</td></tr>

I had thought our administration had done a good job up until now. But when Cabinet officers still get applause after 2 years, something's wrong. [Laughter] The ones that got the most applause are in trouble with me. [Laughter];As a matter of fact, I think that this conference, which I personally did not approve when it was decided in 1976, is turning out to be a very constructive and very productive meeting. It's good for Democratic delegates throughout the Nation to be interested enough to seek a chance to come here and meet with others, some of them at a substantial sacrifice, financially. And ! think the enthusiasm that has already been exhibited, the intense interest in issues has certainly been constructive and instructive to me.;The press and others had anticipated sharp divisions, schisms, debates that were not harmonious at all and not constructive. But that has not been the case. I think the more that our own administration has been assessed, the productivity and leadership of the Congress has been assessed, the more the potential opposition and intense criticism has gone away. It's good for us to be observed with a microscope and for every tiny facet of leadership in our Federal Government to be carefully judged and for us to have advice and counsel and criticism when it is deserved.;I know that the approach of this conference has made me much more aware of a need to inventory what we have done and to analyze our own accomplishments and mistakes and to make plans to present, in a factual but in a positive light, what the Democratic administration has brought to our country.;I'm proud of what we've done. I think the best accomplishment that we can observe is the harmony that exists between me and the Congress, between my entire administration and the State and local officials. It's kind of a new era in American politics, the reestablishment of the sense and the system of federalism which was really totally absent the 8 years before I became President.;I was Governor for 4 of those years, and a very active and enthusiastic and eager Governor. And there was no access from me, representing 5 million people in Georgia, to the core of leadership in Washington, even at the sub-Cabinet level, it was almost impossible for me to get an appointment or to discuss issues that were being contemplated for implementation by the Nixon and Ford administrations. But that's been changed. And I think we've seen a building of a foundation, not only for greater accomplishments in the future but also for greater political achievements in the future.;Although we lost some crucial and disappointing campaign efforts last month, the overall outcome of the election showed a massive approbation and confidence among the American people in Democrats. We have more than 60 percent of the Members of the House who are Democrats, more than 60 percent of the Governors and Senators—just about 60 percent, a very heavy majority. And I think that this has been a notable contribution made by John White, a tremendous chairman who has helped to bring us all together.;We've got a long way to go, both politically and in an administrative and leadership capacity. I'm now involved in the most unpleasant portion of my year-it was the same a year ago—the preparation of the Federal budget. But I'm determined to meet the goals that I've set for myself, and I am reassured in those long, tedious sessions by a firm knowledge that you support those goals and that the average American also supports those goals.;I'm perfectly willing, as I see the evolution of the budget toward a final conclusion, to be judged personally on whether it is fair to the American people, whether our obligations overseas are met, our defense commitments are adequate, the social programs are also designed in a proper priority and at a proper level to meet the legitimate needs of our people. And these are not incompatible with the commitment that I have made to control inflation.;We inherited a mess in bureaucratic terms, in budget terms, in the administration of existing social programs, and in the relationships that did exist between the White House and the people of our country, and the White House and the Congress. Any thoughts that go back to 2 or more years ago would prove that what I've just said is true. Two years is not a long time in the historical evolution of a nation. But we've not only achieved things already of which we can be legitimately proud, but we've laid a groundwork or basis for even more progress in the future.;In international affairs, I'm very pleased with what we have done. We have not been afraid to become involved in highly controversial, sometimes hopeless, apparently hopeless efforts to bring peace to others throughout the world. We didn't have to attempt to bring majority rule and democratic government to Namibia and Rhodesia. This has been an intransigent problem for years, even generations. But we've been willing to put my own reputation on the line to risk disappointments and defeats, castigations from all sides, to join in with our Western Allies and try to bring those goals into fruition.;Andy Young in the United Nations has raised a new image of our country to more than a hundred newly formed or small or weak or black or yellow or brown nations. Whereas formerly we were considered to be their prime opponent, we were the target of their attacks, now they look upon us as an ally, as a representative of the finer and decent aspects of life. This is an accomplishment in itself.;And peace generally pervades in southern Africa, even though the threat of violence still exists. We are making some progress in Cyprus. We've got remarkably good progress in Nicaragua. And instead of violence and thousands of people losing their lives in Nicaragua, we joined in, as you know, with the Dominican Republic and Guatemala in what seemed to be an absolutely hopeless case.;And now last night the FAO, representing the Sandinistas, and the Somoza government has decided to sit down and begin negotiating today, not on how to stop massive bloodshed, but on the terms of a plebiscite to determine the government of Nicaragua in the future. We can't say that we've reached complete success, but we were willing to get in and use the tremendous influence of the United States in a beneficial way.;I won't repeat what I said last night about the Middle East. Cy Vance is arriving in Egypt today. He'll be negotiating with President Sadat. He'll go from there to Israel. We hope and pray we'll be successful. We don't have control over that, obviously, because those are two independent and proud nations. But we've used our influence in a beneficial way, and sometimes, as you know, I've been severely criticized by Americans who felt that I was going too far, not going far enough, or taking a biased position. But I think it's accurate to say that both those governments trust us to do our best.;We're trying to reach agreement with the Soviet Union on a SALT II treaty, and we're making good progress. My anticipation is that we will have, soon, a success. This obviously can't be guaranteed, because we don't ever know what the Soviet Government will do. But the differences that still divide us are very tiny compared to the differences that we've already resolved. But we've not been afraid to stand firm. I have never let a time deadline put me in a vulnerable position. We've not been hasty. And I can assure you that when the SALT agreement is presented to the American people, that it will meet the standards that we set forth.;I think we've strengthened alliances that were damaged severely, and we've raised high the banner of human rights.;These are the kinds of things that we have done so far that bring me gratification. But the main thing is the future. And that's where I would like to thank you for what you've done to keep the Democratic Party viable, to keep the Democratic Party together, and to keep the Democratic Party in the forefront of the domestic and foreign commitments that exemplify the greatness of our Nation. In times of extreme need, under John White, under Bob Strauss, both of whom are here, Ken Curtis, you helped financially, and this has been one of the most gratifying aspects of my own relatively brief political life.;When we were in deep distress, you came through with no thought or expectation of benefiting personally. It's the kind of generosity that too often goes unrecognized, but I recognize it, and I thank you for it. You'll never be thanked adequately, but the financial stability of our party is extremely important.;As you know, there again, we inherited a $9 million debt, left over from ancient past campaigns. [Laughter] And we've not only tried to keep our party viable financially by tight management and the elimination of waste, but we've also had to pay off those back debts. And I feel deeply indebted to you.;The last thing I want to say is this: We are partners in every sense of the word. If and when we do have success in controlling inflation, or putting our American people back to work, or building homes, or providing better education, or bringing peace to the Mideast, or a good SALT agreement, or better relations with the developing nations of the world, it's not the President who's done it, it's not even the Congress who has done it, it's you, who represent the families and the communities and the towns and cities and counties and States throughout our Nation, that never yield, in spite of disappointing news—sometimes, even embarrassments-coming out of Washington, in your commitment to a finer and greater America.;And I feel a personal sense of gratification to each one of you. And I feel the assurance of future success, because that partnership is sound and because your hopes, your commitments, your unselfishness, your understanding is unvarying.;And as President of the United States, as the titular head of the Democratic Party, I thank you, one and all, from the bottom of my heart.;Thank you.</td></tr>

And the friends, power, and influence are all growing every day, and I'm thankful for it. I'm sure it's because the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have hearts that are pure, and they certainly have a cause that is just.;Mrs. Royhal just told me that Ed 1 is feeling very well. His message was one of great encouragement to us, and I am looking forward to continuing my work with him as soon as he is released from the hospital, perhaps tomorrow.;1 Representative Edward R. Roybal of California.;Tonight we are enjoying' good food, good hospitality, good friendship, good company, and good plans for the future and good memories of the past. But as we gather together in a spirit of celebration and good fellowship, we must never forget that we are here because of something that's larger and much more important.;Everyone in this room is a part of three great struggles, struggles that have defined the history of our time. I'm talking about the struggle for human rights at home and abroad. I'm talking about the struggle for basic social and economic justice, and I'm talking' about the struggle for a peaceful Earth.;The actions that I take as President of the United States of America are aimed at advancing, with you, these three great causes. The lives of many in this room have literally been dedicated to these causes. And in these battles, the members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have been, as you know, just where they belong, always in the front lines of the struggle. I've been proud to stand with you for the last 2 1/2 years, and I'm proud that we've stood together in a common cause.;Ed Royhal and his colleagues—Bob Garcia, Baltasar Corrada, and Kika de la Garza, and others who have joined the Spanish Caucus—have made their voices heard far beyond their own districts. They've fought for the rights of all Hispanic Americans, whether their background is Mexican or Cuban Puerto Rican, Central American, or South American. They've fought for jobs, for political participation, for better education, and for an end to prejudice, discrimination, and bigotry.;All Americans, not just those who happen to speak Spanish, have benefited from their efforts. And on behalf of all Americans, I thank them, and I thank you.;The road we travel together is long and it is hard, but we are moving. And we are going to keep on moving and keep on pushing until the magnificent ideals of this Nation are a reality for all who live within its borders.;Tonight, I want to report to you very briefly on the progress we have made together within this Government and within this Nation in the cause of liberty, of justice, and of peace.;This Nation was founded on a passionate commitment to basic human rights, but for too many years our Government, our Nation, has seemed to have lost touch with this basic source of strength. It's been said often, and said rightly, human rights begin at home. And I'm determined that the provisions of the United States Constitution and the laws of our land shall apply to all who live within the borders of our country, whether they are citizens or not.;Months ago I urged all the Governors of our country, and I have now signed an order to all of the heads of the departments and agencies in our own Government, directing them to see that undocumented aliens are treated fairly and humanely in every instance. And I'm directing Federal officials to give full cooperation to officials of other nations who seek their help in investigating any allegation of discrimination or deprivation of those basic human rights which we hold so dear.;We have not yet stamped out all the vestiges of bigotry and brutality in our country, but we must do so. These have been the goals of Leonel Castillo as Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Leonel has made the INS more efficient and more responsive, so that suffering people, trying to obey the law, would not have to wait years for a simple answer to a basic question. He took on one of the toughest, most thankless jobs there is in the United States, and he did it well. And all of us ought to thank him for it.;I know that Leonel is disappointed at some things which have not yet been done in the not much more than 2 years that he has served so well, but I am very proud of his accomplishments.;For too long both the legislative and the executive branches of Government have ignored our immigration policies and the problems that were building up throughout our land. Undocumented aliens have feared that any solution attempted would be at their expense, and a great many other people have just found it easier not to think about this problem as long as it was others who suffered and not themselves.;Together in the last few months, we have tried to face up to these difficult problems and to seek real solutions. We are making some progress. We've not yet gone far enough. And we are consulting closely with the Mexican Government officials for the first time, and other countries who are involved. And I promise you that this effort which has been initiated so well by Leonel Castillo, by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, will not terminate with his departure. He will continue to help us, and the progress that he started will continue as well.;Some parts of our policy are very controversial-human rights at home also means justice, tempered with mercy.;Last week, I commuted the sentences of the last four Puerto Rican nationalists who attacked President Truman and wounded five Members of Congress more than 25 years ago. I did this for humane reasons.;AUDIENCE MEMBER. Why?;THE PRESIDENT. I'll tell you why. I did this for humane reasons and because I agreed with Congressmen Garcia and Corrada and with Franklin Lopez and others here tonight, that the time that they had served, more than 25 years, was long enough.;I'd like to make it clear that an important principle was involved. These nationalists were imprisoned for criminal conduct, not for their political views. Like other Americans, they're entitled to the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution. And I can say to you that our country is strong enough so that we can honor the principle of freedom of speech, and we need not fear those who speak out with ideas with which we may disagree.;On the important issue of the future status of Puerto Rico, I will support whatever decision is made by the people of Puerto Rico because I believe— [applause] —because I feel that Puerto Ricans have enough judgment to make a decision about their own future for themselves, and I will honor their judgment.;We must look now to the present and its needs, and to a better future for all Puerto Rican citizens, whether they live on the island or whether they live here on the mainland. And we seek to fulfill human rights here at home, and we will continue to speak out for human rights abroad.;From the day that I took office, I have sought to place at the top of my agenda and to awaken the conscience of the world and to bring that conscience about human rights to bear on the world's leaders. We have created an atmosphere that I believe has made significant progress on human rights throughout our hemisphere. Many prison doors have swung open, repression of the poor and the weak and the helpless has been eased in many countries. Democratic government or civilian government has been rescued and has replaced military governments and autocratic governments, where people had little voice.;The struggle for human rights is basic and so is the struggle for the economic and the social justice which permits human beings to enjoy those rights once they have been obtained with dignity. That struggle cannot be won unless the Government of this country, which we love, is peopled with men and women of courage, ability, sensitivity, and the knowledge of the special problems which many of you in this room know so well.;I will have two superb new leaders to help me in the near future. One of them is Abelardo Valdez, who is now administering our AID program and who will soon be the United States Chief of Protocol. The other is a fine man, one of the most competent men I know in government, who happened to have been born in Mexico City, has practiced law there for 19 years, who served our Nation well, and who will now be the Secretary of the Navy of the United States of America, Edward Hidalgo. I think Abelardo and Edward are here. Are they here? Stand up if you will, new Secretary of Navy. He was not only my first choice, he was first choice of the former Secretary of Navy, now the Deputy Secretary of Defense. And I am very proud of you, Edward, and what you've already done for our country.;As you know, in order to advise me on personnel and other important affairs, Esteban Torres, who came here with me tonight, has joined my White House staff. Ambassador Torres has distinguished himself both in government and also as a labor leader.;As United States Ambassador to UNESCO, his ability to make friends was demonstrated by his election to the UNESCO Executive Board. Our country is not always unanimously popular in the United Nations. But when Esteban ran for the Executive Board of UNESCO, out of 130 countries voting, he got 127 votes.;He's going to be giving me advice on many things, one of which is how to get votes. [Laughter];Ambassador Torres is working closely with me, also. on the upcoming visit of President Lopez Portillo of Mexico. And he will make sure that your voice is heard every day when policy is made within the White House. Assisting him will be Gilbert Colon.;All of those that I've named, and many others, are working very closely with our new Attorney General to root out any element of racism or discrimination in our system of criminal justice. And a special advisory committee is being set up, with Esteban's help and the help of the Attorney General, of Hispanic Americans to make sure that this goal, which has not been accomplished in the past, will be accomplished in the future.;We also know that accurate information about our country is a. fundamental weapon in the struggle for social justice. In this connection, the 1980 census is a major opportunity and a personal challenge to me and to everyone in this room. If Hispanic Americans are to be full partners in all aspects of American life and to share in its full benefits. we must have an accurate count of how many Hispanic Americans live in the United States of America.;I have for the first time directed the Census Bureau to hire bilingual census takers, to print questionnaires in Spanish, and to work with community groups and leaders who understand their own community, to encourage cooperation. It's important, because of the sensitivity of some people's lives who live here, that the confidentiality of individual census information will be protected. And I have directed, without equivocation, that this be done.;I cannot look at the individual information, your Congressman cannot look at it, and no other Government agency can look at this individual confidential information that will give us accurate information. An accurate count will mean better Government funding for areas that have a high population of Hispanic Americans and better political representation. And a much larger Congressional Hispanic Caucus will result from better counts of those who live in our country. That in turn will put much more muscle behind the efforts that all of you tonight in this room will espouse for the benefit of those in our country who speak Spanish.;With your help, we've increased funds for bilingual education already, in just a little over 2 years by 50 percent. And I've requested funds for a special program for bilingual vocational education. And I strongly support, by the way, the legislation which has already passed the Senate to give the Southwest Border Commission authority to award construction grants to ease severe overcrowding in schools in the Southwest, in heavily Hispanic areas.;Just as we carry on the struggle for human rights and social justice, we're struggling to build peace and security in this hemisphere and throughout the world.;In the Western Hemisphere, among our American neighbors, we believe in peace. We believe in a policy of nonintervention. We respect the other American states as equals and as individuals. We work closely with our friends in political and diplomatic matters. We consult closely with them, because we know that their advice, their counsel, their cooperation is crucial to us to make the right decision on the policy and the motivations and the actions of our own Government that affect those who live in the Caribbean, in Central and South America.;We're promoting economic development and building stronger trade relationships. We are committed, along with the other free countries and free peoples of this hemisphere, to minimize the spread of totalitarian and atheistic Communist influence among the free people of this hemisphere.;I'm very proud that we are rebuilding the world's faith in all these and other American commitments.;Together, with a sense of wisdom and of fairness, we fought and we won a victory for peace and for human rights—that was not politically popular with the Panama Canal treaties. The Senate of the United States took courageous action, and you and I, as full partners, were able to do what was right, because we stood together. I believe that this will be recognized in history as an action that spared this half of the world of possible conflict between peoples that have always in the past been friends, but which would have shattered this friendly relationship forever.;The Congress still must take action on the Panama Canal treaties. And I plead with all of you to use your influence for favorable consideration of the implementation legislation for the Panama Canal treaties, so that we will not be embarrassed by violating the word of honor of our Nation and mistreating the heroic and the generous and the good friends that we have who live in Panama and throughout the southern part of this hemisphere.;In the tragic: wake of the recent Hurricane David, the American people responded immediately and with open hearts to the needs of the people of Dominica and the Dominican Republic. Governor Romero and the people of Puerto Rico have been especially helpful. And the people of Miami, trader Mayor Ferre's leadership, also deserve our congratulations for their donations of food and medicines for the people of the Dominican Republic.;This month, here in Washington, I will meet with President Lopez Portillo of Mexico, and I expect this meeting to further the balanced relationship that I seek with our near neighbor and our friend.;There are many issues of great importance to both nations that we can only manage—because they have been so long ignored—through continual, careful, and close consultation between the United States and Mexico. We'll be discussing energy and trade and border issues, as well as other matters on which we are now negotiating with the Mexican Government. These negotiations are now and will continue to be frank, fair, and mature. They are conducted within a framework of mutual respect and with a conviction that both nations will benefit from them. That's how it should be, and with your continued support, that's how it always will be.;Our relations with Mexico are among the most important that we have in the entire world. And I will never let the inevitable problems and differences of opinion that may arise, deflect us from the mutual respect, friendship, cooperation, and sensitive attention to our proper duties which we share with President Lopez Portillo and the Mexican people.;In closing let me say this: These are just a few items on a big agenda, but I know that we can do this together. Our goals are the same—to bring all Americans, no matter in which country we live, into full partnership in every aspect of our lives, with full justice, economic opportunity, and political participation. If that day is to come down, and come down to us soon, we must work together to bring it about. It will not come automatically. I cannot do it alone, no President could. Government cannot do it alone. You cannot do it alone. But together, if we have a common goal, mutual respect, courage, and respect for one another and for the principles that bind us together, we can make it happen.;To close my remarks I would like to use for a few seconds our Nation's second language.;Tenemos que trabajar juntos para garantizar la participacion total en todos aspectos de la sociedad americana para todos miembros dr: la comunidad hispana, para el futuro de nuestros hi, os, para el Jutufo de la comunidad hispana, y para el futuro de nuestra nacion. Muchas gracias a todos. [We have to work together to guarantee the total participation in all aspects of the American society for all members of the Hispanic community, for the future of our children, for the future of the Hispanic community, and for the future of our Nation. Thank you very much.]</td></tr>

Senator Pat Moynihan, Mayor Ed Koch, Lieutenant Governor Mario Cuomo, President Don Manes, President Saul Cohen, and my friends from Queens and from New York City;I am very glad to be back with you.;First of all, I want to thank the Queens Symphony Orchestra for a tremendous reception.;I was going to make an opening statement or speech. I've decided that since so many people are here, and I know you have a lot of questions, that I will not do so. So, if you will not be timid with your questions, I will not be timid with my answers. Let's get on with the question-and-answer period.;PRESIDENT'S JOGGING HABITS;Q. Mr. President, this is a great honor. My name is Nicholas Gray. I live in Manhattan, and I own a store there called Gray's Papaya. [Laughter] We're famous for our better filet mignon frankfurters.;THE PRESIDENT. My name is Jimmy Carter. I'm President of the United States. [Laughter];Q. I am a fan of yours, and I was told to tell you this.;THE PRESIDENT. I know. Great.;Q. Mr. President, welcome to New York City.;THE PRESIDENT. And I grow peanuts, you know, so eat peanut butter. [Laughter];Q. Welcome to New York City, Mr. President. You look great. There are many millions here who stand firmly behind you and who look forward to your reelection.;My question is friendly and personal. I wonder if you'd take a couple of minutes to tell us about your jogging habits and how you are feeling in general since;your race in Maryland last week?;[Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. I'd like to answer all the questions, including this one. Thank you, Mr. Gray, for your welcome.;I've been running in college. I've been running for the State Senate, and then for Governor, and then for President- [laughter] —still have running on my mind.;I run about 3 or 4 miles a day on the average—sometimes as much as 12 miles, sometimes as little as 2 miles, and enjoy it very much. My wife runs from 2 to 5 miles with me each day. It helps me to be by myself, enjoy a conversation with my wife, and I look forward to it very much. And I stay in good shape, ready for running in the future.;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You look great.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;PRESIDENT'S 1976 CAMPAIGN PROMISES;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. My name is Stewart Weinberg. I'm 22 years old, from Bayside, Queens, and I'd sure like to thank you for making me feel almost as if I'm in touch with my Government. I think it's great. I really do.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;Q. I want you to know that in 1976 I worked very hard for your election campaign. [Laughter] Just cool it people, just cool it. I worked very hard, and I'd like you to take that into consideration when I ask you this question. [Laughter];Consider your 1976 election campaign promises, and consider how those ideas and programs have progressed. Consider that the American dollar has been plummeting. Consider the rise in inflation, the oil crisis, the gas lines, the tremendous cost of home heating oil. Consider the tumultuous nature of your ever-changing Cabinet. Consider how we have added more destruction to our ecosystem with nuclear energy. and oil spills. Consider that we really don't have a comprehensive national energy or health program. And consider that I am a college-educated young man who has been unemployed for 3 months, and I'm very unhappy about that.;Evaluating what I've pointed out, please explain why I should support you for your reelection. What makes you think your first term merits a reelection? I want to know if I should work for you a second time, and why.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you, Mr. Weinberg.;I've now been President for a little more than 2 1/2 years. We've had some notable achievements and we've had some disappointments. I think in trying to go down the list of things that you described—and I'll confine myself to that and not talk about the good things, okay?—to be fair to you.;Employment—when I was elected President and inaugurated, the unemployment rate was 8 percent. Now it's 6 percent. We've had a net increase in jobs in this country of 8 million, a net increase in jobs. This record has mirrored itself in New York City, where the unemployment rate has dropped about 2 percent.;I would like for every college graduate, like you, and also for every person in our country who hasn't had the advantages of college, to have a job. It's not possible to give a job to everyone. I think we've made reasonable progress.;On inflation—we've had inflation with us for about 10 years, 11 years. It's been as high as 12 or 13 percent in 1973 and '74, when OPEC raised their prices. It's up to that level now because OPEC has raised their prices.;In the last 3 months, for instance, the inflation rate, not counting energy, has gone up one-fourth of 1 percent. In that same time, because of action taken by OPEC, over which I have no control, the inflation rate in energy is going up 100 percent per year. And obviously, when that's mixed in with the other costs, the inflation rate is high, it's too high. I wish I could get it down.;You point out that we have no energy policy. We are hammering out a comprehensive, excellent energy policy which I believe and predict flatly will be on the law books by the time this year is over.;We have not ever had before any semblance of an energy policy. And in spite of my efforts for the last 2 1/2 years, the Congress has yet not passed one word relating to oil.;In the past, the oil lobbies have permeated the influence on the Hill in Washington, because consumers had no strong voice. And I have to admit, at that time that oil prices were relatively low. Now it's just about an even thing. But I still predict to you that we will add on to a very good legislative program last year, a complete energy policy this year. It's long overdue, but there's only so much that you can do in 2 1/2 years.;The second thing I'd like to say is that so far we've already saved, because of actions taken within the last 12 months, about 4 million barrels of imported oil that we will not have to import by 1990. My additional proposals, which will pass this year, will save an additional 4 1/2 million barrels of oil.;I know how serious the problem is. I don't know how you reacted in April of '77 when I went to the people on evening television and said this is the moral equivalent of war. Very few citizens, perhaps even including you, rallied to my side and said, "I agree with you, Mr. President. We will fight for an energy policy." But I fought for it, and a lot of people in this country thought it was a ridiculous thing to say. And now we are seeing that we have a serious energy problem that really endangers the security of our Nation.;You mentioned the Cabinet changes. I went 30 months and did not make a single change in my Cabinet. And then I decided that that level of the Cabinet had done some extraordinary things. They had initiated good programs—like Jim Schlesinger, for instance, and put through a major part of the energy program and also set up a Department of Energy, and his time had expired. He wanted to step down.;So, I've now got Charlie Duncan in there—highly qualified, administrator, manager—who can take over an existing department and make sure it functions smoothly.;I've appointed a man as head of HUD, Housing and Urban Development, Moon Landrieu, an accomplished mayor, a mayor of New Orleans. And those of you who keep up with the history of New York City know that just a few years ago, not too long ago, when New York City was on the verge of bankruptcy and despair, there was one mayor in this country who left his city and traveled all over the Nation with 11 other mayors to tell everybody in Georgia, in Washington, in Oregon, in Iowa, "We have got to save New York City." You know who that was? Moon Landrieu, who's now the Secretary of HUD.;And we've got another good man named Neil Goldschmidt, who's taken over now the Transportation Department, an experienced man.;I have no apology for keeping my original Cabinet 30 months, and I have absolutely no apology for making a change when I see fit. It's a prerogative and a responsibility of a President to have his own Cabinet.;I'll say one more thing. This is a long answer, but I think it covers a lot of questions that might have been asked later.;You mentioned national health insurance. I am for national health insurance. We have not had legislation passed through the Congress to improve our health system in any degree for the last 30 years. We need to have it passed. President Truman called for a comprehensive, nationwide health insurance program, we don't have it. Senator Kennedy has been in Congress now for 16 years. His major premise, his major goal has been to establish a comprehensive, national health insurance policy for our country. He's the chairman of the Health Committee in the Senate. He has never gotten a comprehensive national health bill out of his subcommittee. It is not easy.;But I'm determined to get a national health insurance program for our country, and I believe that I now have enough support in the Congress to do it before this term is over. So, we are making some progress, we're making some progress.;Q. I would just like to say one thing.;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. That is, you might just get me to work for you a second time.;THE PRESIDENT. That's a deal. Thank you.;UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION;Q. Mr. President, my name is Barbara Miles, and I'm glad to hear you say you want the hard questions, because I have one for you.;THE PRESIDENT. Great.;Q. I represent a new coalition of religious and community organizations called the Crusade for Work. And I think you can infer from the name what our major interest is.;I think you also will realize that unemployment is dehumanizing and life-threatening, and I'm very glad to hear you say that you've been able to bring the unemployment rate down by 2 percent. But I want to dwell on that a little bit, because we're very disturbed now by your new monetary policies, as articulated by G. William Miller and by Paul Volcker, because those policies, as I understand them, threaten to raise the unemployment rate back up to 8 percent again, while there's no evidence as far as I can ascertain that you will be successful in curbing inflation. So, in view of the risk and the painfulness of this process, then why are you willing to take such a large gamble?;THE PRESIDENT. I have the same feeling you do about unemployment. This is very important.;[At this point, there was an interruption from the audience.];THE PRESIDENT. Now, it's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's a free country. [The interruption continued.];THE PRESIDENT. If you all can hear me, I'll go ahead with my answer. [Applause];Miss Miles, I'm as concerned as you are about the high rate of inflation. But one of the things that we have to remember is that inflation at a high level and unemployment at a high level are directly related. And one of the reasons that we have the prospect of higher unemployment in the future is because we have not been able to control the inflation rate. Most of the cause of that has been because of uncontrollable OPEC prices. But there has to be some dealing with inflation and its root causes.;Every poor person, whether employed or not, is robbed much more severely by inflation even than those who are more wealthy and more able to accommodate their basic needs and may have to do away with some of the luxuries because inflation strikes their family.;We are trying to maintain employment levels high, to target programs. We now have two programs before the Congress: one that would provide additional aid to a locality, perhaps where you live, if the unemployment rate gets above 6 1/2 percent. There's another triggering device, separate program, that would give.jobs, above and beyond the ones we have now, on a nationwide basis, if the unemployment rate gets above 6 1/2 percent. That's a kind of an insurance policy for the future. But in the meantime, I'm determined that we will not waste money.;I have been able, since I've been in office, to cut the Federal deficit more than 50 percent. I think this is important. We've increased services. For instance, since I've been in office, we've increased the amount of money given to education, primarily for the poor, by 60 percent. We've never had that increase before. We've given aid to New York City, $700 million increase, since I've been in office. We've still cut the budget deficit down by 60 percent. At the end of next year, we'll have 20,000 fewer Federal employees, doing a much better job, I think, of administering what we've got.;So, there has to be a combination of restraint on inflation, and it has to be consistent, at the same time more narrowly focusing job opportunities on those who need them most. And I gather from what you say that you represent those who are poor, perhaps minority groups, perhaps even the young, who are most heavily afflicted by unemployment.;We are not ignoring them, and we've made some progress. We still have a long way to go. I will not ever use inflation as a means to wring out our economy and make the poor or the unemployed suffer.;LEADERSHIP QUALITIES;Q. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to ask you this question. My name is Elizabeth Howie. I'm a social studies teacher in Jamaica, Queens, Dominican Commercial High School.;My question is, I believe both you and Senator Kennedy are in essential agreement on most of the basic issues confronting our country today. Many believe the nomination and election will be decided on the question of leadership. And in view of our apparent, as you call it, crisis of confidence, how do you intend to lead, how do you define leadership, how do you intend to inspire us?;THE PRESIDENT. Okay. First of all, I want to say that neither Senator Kennedy nor I are announced candidates. We will have— [laughter] —I will have plans to announce later on this fall. I think on October 13, there will be a preliminary political skirmish between myself and Senator Kennedy in Florida, and we look forward with great anticipation to that encounter. I have no way to know how it's going to come out.;On the subject of leadership, I think the records have to be examined. Let me just not refer to him, because he can speak for himself. But I've never been afraid, since I've been in office, to tackle a difficult issue, even if I knew it was going to cost me votes. I'll give you just two or three quick examples.;I think this is one example of leadership: In the Panama Canal treaties, this had been negotiated for 14 years, and when we ran a public opinion poll—I didn't run it, Gallup Poll did it independently of me—only 8 percent of the American people were in favor of it. But I felt that it was in the interest of our country to go ahead and consummate the treaty and to have it ratified, which has now been done. I could have ignored it.;When I made my speech to the Nation in April of 1977 on the evening television, I said that when I go to the country with an energy policy the consumers are going to be dissatisfied, the producers are going to be dissatisfied, there is no way to win politically—I'll probably lose 15 percent in the public opinion polls. I grossly underestimated my loss in the public opinion polls, but I think this needed to be done.;And I won't go down the list of things. We have had a country at peace. We've not had a single person wounded or killed in combat since I've been in office. That's a sign. In addition, we've had some crises where it required a steady hand and a careful and deliberative decision to be made. I don't think I panic in a crisis.;I'm willing to fight for what I believe in. I was willing to challenge the Republican incumbents in 1975 and 1976 and prevailed. I'm an incumbent President. I think that my record has got to be examined very closely, what we've achieved and what we haven't achieved.;We've made good progress in finally getting a SALT treaty. It must be ratified. It's in the best interest of our country to control nuclear weapons. There has been a 7-year effort to get the treaty completed, unsuccessfully, I was fortunate enough to get it done. I've already mentioned some of the things that we've done on unemployment;The Mideast is an area where the hearts and the minds and the souls of Americans went out to an area tortured by constant war, not just the last 30 or so years when four wars have been fought and thousands of people have been killed, but literally for hundreds of years. And I think it required some degree of leadership, against the advice of all my diplomats, against the advice of all my political advisers—"Do not go to Camp David," "Do not go to the Far East—to the Mideast, because you are doomed to failure." But I had confidence in Prime Minister Begin and President Sadat, and we made some progress.;That's the kind of thing that I've tried to do. But we've had some disappointments. And I will have to face the music for those disappointments and try to point out to the American people what might be accomplished in the next 4 years if my announcement later on this fall is as a candidate.;Q. I wish you luck. Thank you, Mr. President.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;ISRAELI SECURITY AND DEFENSE;Q. Good evening, Mr. President.;THE PRESIDENT. Good evening.;Q. My name is Zahava Teitelbaum, and I'm a housewife and I work for a program for new immigrants. I just came back last week from a trip to Jerusalem, the beautiful and divided capital of the Israeli Government.;My question is, I know the United States would never tolerate terrorist attacks from Cuba, and I wanted to know why the President opposes Israel's right to defend itself on its northern borders against the PLO terrorist incursions into Israel.;THE PRESIDENT. I don't. I think any nation has a right to defend itself, obviously, including Israel. Let me recapitulate just for a moment what has happened.;Two years ago, I met with Prime Minister Rabin and then with Prime Minister Begin and also with President Sadat and others. There was a conviction in their minds that never in their lifetime would they have direct communication with one another and no chance to negotiate a peace treaty between them.;A year ago, almost exactly, we went to Camp David and came down with the Camp David accords, which set out not only a basis for peace between Israel and Egypt but also a basis for a comprehensive peace settlement for the entire Middle East, including all of Israel's neighbors.;Six months ago, we concluded the Mideast peace treaty. And a lot of people say, you know, "What have you done lately?" Well, the fact is that now we are looking to President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to negotiate directly. They have developed a very good respect for one another. And it was a thrilling thing for me to see Sadat sail into the Haifa Harbor recently in an Egyptian yacht, escorted by American and Israeli warships and American and Israeli airplanes, and see him received so well in Haifa.;A basis of the Camp David accords was the right of Israel to defend itself, a right of Israel to be secure. And along with that was a commitment made by President Sadat and myself and Prime Minister Begin that the Palestinian question in all its aspects would be resolved, that the Palestinian people have a right to a voice in the determination of their own future. But, at the same time, Sadat agreed on behalf of many Arabs that Israel would have a right to defend itself. And I have never questioned Israel's right to defend herself against terrorism from the north or against her neighbors from the east or from the south.;The second thing I'd like to say is that we give Israel—as a good investment for our own security, because we derive great benefits from Israel being strong and free and at peace—great aid, the most aid we give any other nation on Earth, because we believe in Israel having the ability to defend itself. In addition to that, as a result of the Camp David accords and the Mideast peace treaty, I advocated to the Congress, and the Congress agreed to increase that aid by $3 billion. And we're now working out with Defense Minister Weizman, who was in Washington in my office last week, how to spend that money to give Israel the means by which they can defend themselves.;But this Government and this President will never abandon Israel. We will always support Israel, and we will always make sure that Israel has the means by which to defend themselves.;I want to say one more thing, and then I'll close this answer. Israel's got one sure friend, and that's the United States of America. And I look with great concern and disgust at a growing clamor around the world, even making the ridiculous charge that Zionism is the same as racism. That's an outrage and a disgrace to human beings.;And I'm not asking you—Miss Teitelbaum, right?—I'm not asking you to give me your support or to approve everything I do. But let me say this: It's important for Israel, for a President like me, to have your support in carrying out the agreements made at Camp David and with the treaty. I need your help and I need your support.;God knows that politics is secondary to me when it comes to the defense and the strengthening and the peace and the security of Israel. But I think that our Government, which has already done so much—working with Sadat and Begin and others to make this major move toward peace—really needs the unity and the support and the understanding of making further progress. Condemnations and criticisms during these transient times, I don't believe help Israel. I don't want you to approve everything I do, but I need your support and your prayers that my future efforts, along with those of the Israelis and Egyptians, will be as successful as they have been in the last 12 months.;NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SAFETY;Q. Mr. President, my name is Barbara Glick. I live in Forest Hills, and I just graduated from York College as of June and, at the moment, am an aspiring, unemployed journalist. And my question centers around a concern that a lot of New Yorkers feel is quite relevant to them.;It has been reported that if a nuclear accident were to occur at Indian Point, depending on the direction of the wind, radiation could spread over a 30-mile radius, causing thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of eventual deaths resulting from cancer, with hundreds of thousands becoming ill.;My questions are these: What requirements are you going to enact, as President, to see that the Three Mile Island syndrome doesn't occur at populous plants such as Indian Point? And B, can you force these plants to come up with adequate emergency plans concerning proper evacuation procedures, which are lacking at the present time?;THE PRESIDENT. Are you referring to the plant in Virginia, where we had the little incident today?;Q. No. I was referring to Indian Point.;THE PRESIDENT. Indian Point, okay. We have by the way, there was an incident today in Virginia, and I've gotten a report from it just a few minutes ago. I don't know the name of the plant. But it is under control, and they are shutting it down. And I understand there are no-there's no danger to it.;Now, we will have a report from the Kemeny Commission on the Three Mile Island accident, I think, within the next month. Until that time, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is acting with extreme caution, waiting for Kemeny and his committee and the NRC and others to decide what was the cause of that accident, whether it was a design failure or an installation failure or an absence of training or improper operating techniques.;When that report is made, I will examine it very thoroughly to see what can be done to ensure in the future that nuclear powerplants are safe. If they aren't, then I would certainly not approve them. There is no guarantee, obviously, of what the Kemeny report will advocate.;We now have in this country about 13 percent of all our energy coming from nuclear powerplants—in Connecticut, I think, 60 percent, in Chicago, maybe 50 percent. And to require those plants to shut down would be ill-advised, and I am not going to do it. But we will do what we can in the future to enhance the security of the plants that might be operating in years to come.;Q. What about as far as evacuation procedures regarding Indian Point? There are none.;THE PRESIDENT. I think that will probably be part of the Kemeny report. And on that basis, we will do what we can.;As you know, the States have a right to decide whether or not a nuclear Power plant can be located within its borders. Some of the States have forbidden, through referenda and through action by the State legislatures, the installation of nuclear powerplants in their State. There is one plant in Georgia that was built while I was Governor. And we have taken action to encourage States to evolve evacuation plans.;And I think that what you have asked and what the people of New York decide is a very important consideration. For the Federal Government to mandate, however, that the nuclear powerplants in New York should be shut down under present circumstances, I think, is an unwarranted encroachment on the local prerogatives. And I would not favor that;and neither would the Congress do it.;Q. Thank you very much.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;Q. And by the way, I love you.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;SOVIET TROOPS IN CUBA;Q. Mr. Carter, my name is Fred Feingold. I'm from Hollis Hills, here in Queens, and I'm a sales representative. I was going to ask you a question about inflation, but that subject has been gone over a bit. I then was going to ask you a question about national health care, but that question, I think, was pretty well done. [Laughter] I was then going to speak about Israel, and that question— [laughter] —was covered. Therefore, to avoid repetitious questions, I'm going to ask you about the Russian troops in Cuba.;In the event that all diplomacy fails, we do everything we can diplomatically—which I'm sure you're doing now—do you foresee another Russian missile crisis if nothing works and the troops just stay there?;THE PRESIDENT. First of all, let me say that this is not the same thing as the 1962 missile crisis. At that time, the Soviets had within Cuba missiles, that could reach our own Nation, that had nuclear warheads. There was a direct threat to our country, and millions of people could have been killed from those launching pads. Our country was threatened with an offensive attack.;The present brigade of Soviet troops in Cuba is not a threat to the security of our country. There are about 2,500 troops there. They do have 40 tanks and a few field pieces, they have no offensive weapons that can reach our shores. They have no capability for a seaborne invasion, they have no capability for an airborne invasion. So, it's not a threat to our security.;The thing that concerns us, however-and this is a serious matter, and the status quo is not acceptable to us—is that it's a combat unit. The Soviets deny it has combat status. But it is a combat unit located in a country in this hemisphere, in a country that is totally dependent on the Soviet Union.;Cuba, in effect, is a puppet of the Soviet Union, and they act completely in accordance with Soviet foreign policy. A hundred percent of all their weapons are given to them by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union gives Cuba about $8 million every day to sustain it economically. They pay five times the world price, for instance, for all Cuba's sugar. They provide them with all their oil. And in response to that or in trade for that, Cuba acts, in effect, as a Soviet surrogate in many nations around the world.;In 1975, as you know, they moved thousands of troops into Angola. Since I've been President, they've moved thousands of troops into Ethiopia. They have troops in many other countries in Africa. So, because of the combination of Soviet support and Cuba acting as a Soviet puppet, this does create a great concern for us. There is, however, no threat to our Nation's security.;We are now trying, through diplomacy, to get the Soviets to eliminate the combat nature of this unit, and I don't know yet whether we will succeed. If we do not succeed, we will take appropriate action to change the status quo.;Q. Thank you, Mr. President.;PRESIDENT'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN;Q. My name is Anthony Cerami. I'm a senior in St. John's University in New York.;THE PRESIDENT. What was your name?;Q. Anthony Cerami. I was a 1976 Carter supporter. Off the record of your administration, I totally expect to support you again in 1980 if you decide to run. I think you've made some tough, sometimes unpopular decisions for the good and the great and long-range good for the American people.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much, Anthony.;Q. My question is—-;THE PRESIDENT. I was hoping you wouldn't ask a question. [Laughter];Q. —if you run again, do you intend to emulate your 1976 strategy of running in every Presidential primary? Because there has been talk that if you lose—in some of the newspapers—that if you lose some of the early Northeastern primaries, you will drop out. Will you run in every primary? Because there's a lot of people out here who want to support you.;THE PRESIDENT. I have never backed down in the face of adversity. I won some primaries and lost some primaries in 1976. And if I become a candidate later on this year, I would intend to run in every primary.;Q. Thank you very much. Good luck.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you.;UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY;Q. Good evening, Mr.. President. Welcome to the Borough of Queens. My name is Noel Casey. I am a resident of Woodside, Queens. I'm an active member of the Carpenters Union, Local 608.;I would like to know what your administration is going to do about the high unemployment in the construction industry in New York City, in projects such as the South Bronx, Westway, Battery Park, and the convention center. Now that we're going to have the 1980 Democratic convention in New York, we don't even have a convention center. That's my question, Mr. President.;THE PRESIDENT. I see. Well, Mr. Casey, it's hard to answer your question specifically, but in the construction industry, we have seen employment increase about 25 percent in the last 2 1/2 years. I don't claim credit for all of that, but I think we have had a massive program for public works, for local public works, and as you know, we've had an average of more than 1.8 million homes built each year since I've been in office.;What we would do in the future is hard now to ascertain. We have a broad range of things that can be done. If we see the unemployment rate begin to go up dramatically in the construction industry or others, I'm not predicting that we'll do any of these things, but we could obviously repeat the great success we had in 1977 with local public works programs.;The first 2 years I was in office, we reduced taxes about $28 billion, which did stimulate the economy to some degree. We have the focused countercyclical bills for jobs under the Government, CETA jobs and otherwise, which provide several hundred thousand jobs in communities that are most highly impacted because of unemployment.;But I think so far we've got a fairly good record. We'll monitor it very closely and decide in the future what to act on, but I would guess that our future actions would be based on the successes that we've had in 1977 with that stimulus program. That's the best answer I can give.;Q. Last year you came to the South Bronx.;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. And you promised Federal money for the South Bronx, and,vet today the South Bronx is still the same way.;THE PRESIDENT. I didn't promise to rebuild the South Bronx in 6 months. I promised to work with the local and State officials and start the rejuvenation of South Bronx.;We've spent an awful lot of time and effort and, so far, allocated substantial financial resources in the South Bronx. I don't remember the exact amount of money that we put in there extra to try to start making progress, but it's been substantial. And I don't claim, standing here before all of you, that we have cleaned up the South Bronx or put the South Bronx back in a profitable or a successful state. I can't claim that, but we've made good progress.;And I think, as you know, your own local officials, on one major proposal for the South Bronx, decided not to go ahead with it. I don't believe in a philosophy of government that lets the Federal Government come in and take over and run things in contradiction to your locally elected officials. And I'll ask my good friend Ed Koch to be responsible to you for the rejuvenation of the South Bronx in the future.;SOVIET TROOPS IN CUBA;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. My name is Pete Reilly, from Syosset, Long Island. I'm a student at C. W. Post College. I'm studying economics and acting. [Laughter] I want to be a politician.;I would like to challenge you on your answer about the Soviet troops in Cuba.;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know which is worse right now, to be an economist or a politician. [Laughter] Go ahead and challenge.;Q. You said that the status quo is unacceptable—;THE PRESIDENT. That's right.;Q.—and you'll take appropriate measures to alter it.;THE PRESIDENT. That's correct.;Q. What are "appropriate measures?;THE PRESIDENT. I would rather not spell out at this point what we will do.;There are two ways to change the status quo. One is by the action of the Soviet Union. If the Soviets fail to act, then the other way to change the status quo is by action on the part of the United States. And I will report to the Nation, probably within the next week, after we get through with our negotiations with the Soviet Union, what action I will take. But it would not be appropriate tonight for me to give you the details of what we might do.;Q. I understand that.;THE PRESIDENT. Okay, go ahead, Pete.;Q. What I wanted to say was, you know, you're trying to separate the SALT II issue from the Cuban issue.;THE PRESIDENT. Yes, they ought to be separated. There ought not to be any connection.;Q. Okay. But I want to tell you, the assumption of the SALT II treaty is that—we're laying the groundwork for peace between the Soviet Union and America. Why do they have troops in Cuba? For that matter, why do the Soviets back troops if they want peace? Why are they eating up Southeast Asia? Why are they in Africa? Why do they denounce peace in the Middle East? Where are we going to draw the line? Our measures have got to be effective.;THE PRESIDENT. You put me in the position of defending the Soviet Union, which I have no inclination to do. [Laughter] But let me say this: There have been troops in Cuba for a long time.;Q. I understand.;THE PRESIDENT. In 1962 there were 22,000 troops in Cuba. Evidence is that ever since that time, there have been substantial numbers of Soviet troops in Cuba.;We, this year, began to monitor that situation much more closely. In the past Cuba was not a high priority for us to monitor with our surveillance systems on a concentrated basis. We were looking at the Soviet Union to make sure they complied with the provisions of SALT I, we were monitoring Vietnam during that war, and we, this year, earlier, focused our attention more on Cuba to monitor what the Soviet troops were doing. My judgment is that the number of Soviet troops is less now than it was in 1963, for instance, months after all the missiles had been moved out of Cuba in October, I believe, of 1962.;The question is whether this is a combat unit—we're convinced it is—and whether that combat status should change. I might point out to you that the United States:has troops in several countries around the world, some of them very close to the borders of the Soviet Union. This is part of a normal interrelationship between major powers, like ours, and the Soviet Union. We have troops in South Korea, we have troops in Japan, we have a few troops in Turkey, we have had some troops in Iran, and so forth. And so, this is not a new thing.;But we want the Soviets to understand that the American people are exceptionally sensitive about Soviet combat troops in this hemisphere, particularly in a country like Cuba, which acts, in effect, as an arm of the Soviets in adventurism and intervention in other countries.;How to deal with this successfully is not an easy task, but we'll do the best we can. And I believe that you will be satisfied when I make my report to the country within the next week.;Q. One departing remark. Thanks a lot. That's the first time I ever spoke to a President. [Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. This is your last question. [Laughter];Q. Yes. I just want to say a departing remark. I'm just worried about the principle of the matter, not the threat of invasion. Thanks, President Carter.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you very much.;OIL PRICES;Q. My name is Lori Kober, and I'm a student at Saint Mathias School, and I'm 11 years old. This is my question. There are four kids in my family, and my parents just bought a house. This house is to use oil heat, and my more says that oil is very expensive. Is there anything you will do to help about these high prices?;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. Your first name is Laura?;Q. No. Lori.;THE PRESIDENT. Lori, okay. It's very difficult for me to answer your question, because there's a limit to what I can do.;Throughout the entire world, Lori, the price of oil is going up. It's increased 65 or 70 percent, almost doubled, in the last 8 months. In the last 5 years, the price of oil has gone from $2 a barrel to almost $30 a barrel. It costs 15 times as much as it did in 1973. And as the price of oil goes up, which everybody has to pay, then the price of gasoline and diesel oil and home heating oil and kerosene also go up.;What we are trying to do now is to cut down or reduce the amount of oil that we buy from overseas. We buy about half our oil from foreign countries. This is what we are trying to correct with our new energy policy.;Next year we'll send about 70 billion American dollars overseas to pay for foreign oil. And we import, with the oil, high inflation—which is what bothers your mother—and also unemployment.;We have made some progress. Earlier this year, we thought that there would be a shortage of home heating oil this winter. I think we've now got the oil companies to produce enough oil to take care of the needs of people who live in New York and the States further north.;One thing that you and your family can do is—since the oil companies now have enough oil for the winter—is to cut down on the amount that you use. The less oil people use, the more we save, the less we waste, then the cheaper the price is going to be, because you have a certain amount of oil, and if people don't buy as much as you have in the past, then there will be more competition and people will have to sell their oil at a lower price.;We've also gotten a few of the oil companies-Texaco and seven or eight more—to agree not to raise their prices any more in the next number of weeks, as the winter comes on us. The prices have already gone up too much. We want to make sure they don't go up any more.;And the other thing that we are doing is providing help for poor families, who are the first ones to suffer when the price of energy goes up, particularly oil. We will have the Congress pass this year $400 million worth of aid for families that are poor to help them pay their heating bills. And we've asked, in the windfall profits tax, which I hope the Congress will pass without delay, a tax on the oil companies, another $1.6 billion to take care of tax credits for poor families as well.;So, we're trying to get the oil companies to hold down the price. We're asking people to save oil and not waste it, to hold down the price. And we're going to provide financial help, direct grants, that the Governor will administer, for families that are poor and who cannot afford to pay for oil.;But I don't think there's any need to—I don't want to mislead you, Lori—the price of oil is going to continue to go up in the future no matter what I do or what anybody else does, because all over the world it's getting scarcer and people are demanding more. We're going to move toward solar energy. We're going to move toward a greater use of coal, and we're going to move toward a greater development of our own energy supplies. And I think that will help us a great deal in the future.;But our country waited too long to start acting to get an energy policy. Now we are moving. And as I predicted earlier, by the end of this year we will have a good energy policy passed into law by our Congress, which will help you and your family in the future.;That's a great question and I thank you for it.;I can take one more question, I understand.;TAX REDUCTIONS;Q. Mr. President, I'm Kathleen McGilloway. I'm a housewife, and this is also the first time I've ever spoken to a President.;THE PRESIDENT. I'm glad to talk to you, Kathleen.;Q. But it has generally been acknowledged that our present tax structure is grossly unbalanced, penalizing married working couples and middle-income families. They pay high taxes while many large corporations pay little or none. Do you plan to rectify this situation?;THE PRESIDENT. I could hear you, Kathleen.;That's one of the failures that we've experienced since I've been in office. When I was here in New York in August of 1976 and made my acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, I pointed out then that the tax system in this country is a disgrace to the human race. It still is. It's not fair.;We've made some changes in it, very minor changes, because the pressure groups and the lobbyists in Washington are almost beyond comprehension. And when you start trying to make corrections to the tax laws, quite often the Congress goes in the opposite direction and opens up more loopholes for those who are powerful enough and influential enough to have active lobbyists there.;We have had some reduction in taxes since I've been in office, about $28 billion. We may have to have some more in the future. But I cannot tell you that we have made any substantial progress in that respect. And it's only going to be when an aroused public demands action by individual Members of the House and the U.S. Senate that we will ever have substantive tax reform. I wouldn't say it's hopeless, but it hasn't happened so far.;Two years ago we could not get the public to demand an energy policy. It looked hopeless. And now we see progress. And I think the same thing applies to the Middle East, and the same thing applies to SALT, and so forth. You just have to take one thing at a time until the public is genuinely interested, and then you can make progress.;But I hope and pray that in the future we will change the tax structure to make it fairer to the average citizen and take away the gross loopholes that reward the powerful and the rich, who can pay lobbyists to protect their interests in Washington. I'm with you. I have not been able to do anything yet.;Let me say one other thing in closing. I think your questions have been very good, and I've enjoyed them and enjoyed the chance to answer them. I learn a lot from you, by knowing what is of interest to you and having a chance to explain what I have done and what I have not done, the successes we've achieved and the failures that we've achieved so far.;We're in it together. If I'm successful as a President, then you have a 'better country. When I fail in my duties, because of obstacles that I just cannot overcome, it hurts you as well. But I think we all ought to remember this: No matter what your political affiliation or no matter what your special interest might be, we tend to dwell in this country on the transient inconveniences and disappointments, and we remember very vividly the things that divide us one from another and the intense debates and the times when we've failed to overcome a challenge the first try. But what we forget is the manifold blessings that we have in this country and bow many things bind us together and the principles of freedom in a democracy, which make us able, in the future, to achieve success where we haven't yet done it.;And I would like to remind you in closing that not only is this a nation that believes in free speech, but we are also the greatest nation on Earth. And if you help me, we'll keep it that way.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

We ourselves are part of the Caribbean community, and we know that development and democracy are key to realizing the strength of the region and meeting its challenges.;The Caribbean today is passing through a time of rapid change, and our mutual challenge is to steer a course economically, socially, and politically that will lead to a better life for all our people.;Twenty years ago only three island nations in the Caribbean were independent. Today there are 13 such sovereign nations, and that number is likely to increase by as many as 5 in the next few years. Behind these numbers is a stirring history. Its beginning was an unpleasant story, marked by lonely struggles against slavery, colonialism, and, too often, indifference by the outside world. But the drive of the Caribbean peoples toward freedom and modern development is primarily a proud story, one of courage, imagination, and determination in the face of hardship.;Today, however, with independence largely won, the Caribbean still faces many problems. Perhaps the most serious problems are economic. Spiraling oil prices, unstable commodity markets, uneven growth, inflation, and unemployment are certainly not unique to the Caribbean. But these global trends have struck the small countries of the Caribbean with special severity. They add a major burden to the always imposing challenge of the building and development of independent nations. And economic deprivation creates vulnerabilities to extremism and to foreign intervention.;In facing these problems, the Caribbean has some significant advantages. In addition to its beauty and climate, vigorous political institutions and talented human resources provide special opportunities. From the resurgent social democracy of the Dominican Republic to the established parliamentary traditions of some English-speaking peoples, free institutions have fostered development within a stable framework.;The awarding of this year's Nobel Prize to the distinguished development economist, W. Arthur Lewis from Trinidad, 1 exemplifies the achievements and contributions of the island's peoples.;1 Sir Arthur is a native of Saint Lucia.;Citizens of the United States and the Caribbean stand together with a common pride in our achievement. We stand for the rights of people to be free of oppression, free from arbitrary abuse, and free to participate in a nation's political life.;These rights of freedom are precious. Whatever the claimed justification, we will not be silent when these rights are abused. We stand with those who are genuinely committed to economic development. We stand with those who espouse social justice and human rights and who work to translate them from abstract goals into real programs. We stand with those who are genuinely committed to international relations based on mutual respect.;As President, I've sought consistently to implement these principles and to strengthen relations in the nation and in the region. We negotiated canal treaties with Panama, in keeping with our determination to forge new and better relationships with developing countries. We've worked with 30 countries and 15 international institutions to establish a Caribbean group which has expanded and coordinated the flow of aid to the region and will support efforts in the future to design, fund, and implement regionally integrated development activities.;My administration has increased direct economic assistance to the Caribbean, nearly doubling bilateral aid obligations over the past 2 years. As actual disbursements reflect these increases, we will be contributing more than ever before to generate employment and to help basic human needs. This is particularly true for the newly independent countries of the eastern Caribbean.;We've come rapidly to the assistance of countries like the Dominican Republic and Dominica, friends in need of emergency aid to rebound from natural disasters. We've repeatedly shown our eagerness to support political freedom and democratic processes. But such governmental action, no matter how important, is still not enough. And that's why your meeting is so important.;The United States has vast untapped resources of technology, skills, and good will. I will use my office and my influence to help mobilize the people of the United States to work with the people of the Caribbean for common goals, social and economic development, and democracy.;In the United States, our universities, our agricultural and labor organizations, business and industry, churches and other benevolent institutions, State and local governments, and individual private citizens can all play a vital role in establishing mutually advantageous relationships with our friends in the Caribbean. We can all benefit from improvements in education, agriculture, tourism, industry, trade, health, transportation, employment opportunities, and personal friendships among our people.;The answers for the future are in the Caribbean's own talents and traditions, not in the false promises of foreign models. Solutions will not emerge by blaming our problems on our own friends. To seek freedom, justice, independence, and a better life, one needs to work closely with those who genuinely share the goals of development and democracy. I hope that all the other basin States of Venezuela and Colombia, Mexico and Central America, will play a vigorous role in this effort.;The Caribbean group is an excellent example of the benefits of a multilateral effort. Closer cooperation between the Caribbean community and the Central American Common Market and, perhaps also, the Andcan Pact could be another step toward greater progress. Like the Caribbean, Central America is experiencing a period of profound change. Unlike the Caribbean, where nations are struggling to defend democratic institutions while they modernize, many of the nations of Central America are seeking to develop democratic institutions which had not previously existed. Nevertheless, both regions have much in common and also much to learn from each other.;Few societies can more genuinely speak of a common destiny than ours, for the United States and the Caribbean, the ties of history and geography are continuously renewed by what can only be described as one of the most intense people-to-people relationships in the world today. It's a relationship filled with exciting possibilities that are waiting to be explored. As leaders and molders of opinion, we have a special responsibility to build understanding, to defend the region's democratic institutions, and to promote development of social and economic justice.;On behalf of the United States, I pledge our continuing respect and support for all these efforts.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Well, first of all, let me welcome you all to the White House. I hope you have had an interesting and a fruitful morning, not only with your answers that you've received here but with the questions that you've asked. It's very helpful to us to hear from all of you from around the Nation.;THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAN;I'd like to open by saying that I believe that we are now facing one of the most serious threats to peace since the Second World War, with the invasion by the Soviet Union and the brutal attempt to repress the independent people of Afghanistan in this last, very most serious crisis that our Nation faces and has observed. The world has condemned the Soviet Union in an almost unprecedented way, with 104 nations in the United Nations voting to condemn the presence of the Soviet troops and demanding that they be withdrawn from Afghanistan. Only 18 nations supported the Soviets' position, and those were nations that were either completely dominated by the Soviet Union or heavily dependent upon the Soviet Union for their existence in an economic and viable way.;This expression of condemnation and abhorrence was indeed very widespread, not only the nations adjacent to the Soviet Union, which are under threat, but also among the Islamic countries located throughout the world and, of course, among nations which are industrialized and/or developing themselves at this time.;This threat to peace is one that deeply concerns our own country, and we have taken action which has been forceful and, I believe, punitive to the Soviet Union, to convince them that the consequences of their invasion will not be light. We've forbidden their fishing rights in our waters. We have interrupted the delivery of large quantities of grain. We've interrupted high technology sales to the Soviet Union. And we are now consulting with our allies, in Europe and other places throughout the world, to see what other steps might be advisable.;This is only one of the two major questions that our Nation must resolve—the other, of course, being the illegal kidnaping of the innocent American hostages, and their being held with the support of the Iranian officials themselves. Again, we are taking action in accordance with our own Nation's best interests. We're being consistent, and I hope effective. We're protecting not only the lives of the hostages, but also maintaining a strong, supportive role among a majority of the nations of the world.;No one can predict the outcome of these two threats against peace, one involving an invasion, a military attempt to take over the independent country, another one an act of international terrorism. But we are doing the best we can. And I've been very pleased at the resolve and the courage and the unity of the American people.;We are preparing now for the return of the Congress. I'll be making a State of the Union speech on the 23d. The Congress has a heavy agenda before it. Some major items carried over from this previous year, particularly the three energy bills. And of course we'll be presenting a budget for fiscal year 1981 at approximately the same time.;I think it might be good for me to answer your questions now. Go ahead.;QUESTIONS;SOUTHWEST WATER PROJECTS;Q. Water is a critical issue to those of us living in Arizona—Nina Trasoff, KGUNTV [Tucson]. The Central Arizona Project was a water project that your administration cut out and then reinstated. And what I'd like to know now is what the level of support you have for that water project, which is so vital to our cities, Southwest. Are you still strongly in support of it, just helping us get the water that we need so desperately?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know the latest status of it. As you know, the Congress has acted on the Central Arizona Project, a major water project for Arizona. And I presume that the published plans of the Corps of Engineers and the Interior Department, one or the other, is being carried out. I've not been involved in the latest exact schedule for financing, but so far as I know the Congress has acted. As you know, I didn't approve the project as it was originally conceived, and I have no idea that it's been changed in recent weeks.;Q. No, there have been no changes since it was reinstated. I was mostly questioning your continuing support for the varying ways to get water resources to the Southwest.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I don't know of any interruption in the project. And I am in favor of getting adequate water. I just don't want to waste money.;Q. One water question is your decision to implement a very old bill, Federal water being supplied to farms, and that the farmer would have to live within 50 miles of that farm in order to qualify for the Federal water—;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know about that.;Q. It had to do with—I think it was trying to keep large corporations from taking over small family farms.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, as you know, we've had major legislation in the Congress to deal with Federal lands, lands for which Federal water is supplied, in California, primarily, and a few other States. But the limit there is one in compliance with the 1903 law that limits, I think, 160 acres to a family. We have modified that, I think, to 320 acres. And the Congress is now considering what to do. That bill has not been passed by both Houses of Congress.;Q. Is there any consideration of perhaps letting a person living farther than 50 miles from their farm, that they might still get the Federal water?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it's varied by river basins. But the Secretary of the Interior's proposal is the one that I support.;PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE PRESIDENT;Q. Mr. President, a few months ago you seemed to have a crisis of confidence, in that the polls showed that the people of America had little confidence in your ability to run the Government. And now the public seems to be giving you a vote of confidence, if you believe the polls. Why do you think the change took place?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, I think the public opinion polls go up and down. I've been at peaks.and I've been in valleys. As far as political considerations are concerned, the only poll that counts is on election day in a particular State or in the Nation next November.;I really don't know how to answer the question adequately. I think that my administration has deserved the support of the people from the beginning. We've obviously not been perfect, but I think we've had a good, constructive, solid, consistent approach to America's domestic and foreign problems.;Some have been very difficult, and the slow action of the Congress, for instance, has created frustration, not only here in my own administration but among the people. Energy, for instance, is a crucial issue. We've been wrestling with the energy question since April of 1977, when I presented a comprehensive policy to the Congress.;We've had good success at times: with the Mideast peace treaty, for instance, a highly publicized, partial success—we are still working on it. And we've had times when inflation was considered to be the utmost issue, and we have not been successful in dealing with inflation. The overdependence on foreign oil is one reason. We've had good success with unemployment. So, I think it's been a mixed bag as far as people's impression of whether I was being successful at a particular time. We have been persistent.;Another thing is that our Nation has faced in recent months, the last 2 months, a little more, a threat to world peace. And I think at a time like this the President's voice is heard very clearly. I've had a chance to speak and let the American people understand the considerations that I've had to face, and understand the decisions that I've made. I think basically we've taken the right steps to meet the threat to our hostages in Iran, more recently the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.;And the last point is that as long as I didn't have any clearly identifiable political opponents, there is obviously an inclination to compare me with some perfect image of what a President ought to be: a tall, distinguished, handsome, gray-haired— [laughter] —articulate, and so forth—and all religions, depending on what religion the voter might happen to be, and so forth. But I think once it got down to a matter of me versus specific human beings who also sought the Presidency, that factor was minimized.;But I anticipate the polls to change in the future. Right now they seem to be fairly good. But we'll be watching with interest to see how the primary elections come out.;PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN PLANS;Q. Mr. President, you're supposed to be in California campaigning next month. Campaign Chairman Strauss was at Fresno last Friday, and he said that campaign planning has to be done on about a 30-day basis and that he could not guarantee that the plans might not have to be changed due to circumstances, particularly in view of the Iran hostage situation and the Russian presence in Afghanistan. Can you explain when you feel that the exigencies of the political campaign, the American election process, will require you to give a higher priority to the reelection campaign itself?;THE PRESIDENT. It's hard for me to set a date. What I have tried to forgo—and on some stretches of days what I have had to forgo—is the involvement of myself as a clearly identifiable, partisan campaigner, as a substitute for the President of our country. There have been times when I could not have left here had I wanted to, and there have been other times when I have felt that I needed to have a nonpartisan support for me as President.;I think if I should change into a highly partisan campaigner, there would be a sense of belief among the American people that the intense interest in the American hostages, for instance, had been decreased. And obviously, as long as the United Nations is voting, as each vote is important, as I need to call foreign leaders, as I need to consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State on a continuing basis, have frequent meetings all during the day with key leaders of our country, you and others—there's a meeting going on in the White House now that Secretary Vance is briefing—to acquaint the Nation with what our problems are and what our possible solutions to those problems are, it's better for me not to assume the role of a partisan political campaigner.;I have left open the option of going from Washington when my presence here could be spared. But even then I would not want to go to a fundraising event for myself, or to participate in a strictly partisan event, until I consider the alleviation of these crises to be adequate.;Q. It's your intention now to go to California, though, in February?;THE PRESIDENT. That's my present intention, but I cannot assert that I will be there.;RELATIONS WITH ALLIED NATIONS;Q. Mr. President, you mentioned in your opening remarks the talks underway in Europe with our allies on other steps in the Afghanistan crisis. Could you, without getting into too much detail, give us some of the options that might be available here? What are some of the other possibilities?;THE PRESIDENT. The consultations in Europe are more broad-ranging than just Afghanistan. They involve Iran, and they involve other things as well. It's hard to single out any particular item, but this is not a late-developing commitment of our country. Let me just very quickly go down a list of things, without going into detail on any.;Since I've been in office we have seen the need for a stronger national defense. And every one of the years that I've been in office, all 3 years—I've just prepared the fourth budget—we've had a real increase in the commitment to the defense capability of our Nation, above and beyond inflationary trends.;Secondly, we've tried to revitalize NATO which was somewhat dispirited 3 years ago—with an increase in defense commitment there, with long-range 15-year planning, with the sharing of weapons systems, more recently with the theater nuclear force. We've tried to open up friendships with people who were previously adversaries of ours, or at least not friendly—with China, for instance, without destroying the trade relationships and the friendships that exist between ourselves and Taiwan.;We've strengthened our military presence in the North Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea. And we are now exploring the possibility of establishing military facilities there to serve our airplanes and our ships in the Persian Gulf region. We've recommitted ourselves to the capability of Pakistan to successfully defend itself.;We've had, I think, a major step forward in the Mideast peace negotiations, to remove the animosity that previously debilitated to some degree Israel and Egypt, as they look upon each other as enemies rather than friends. And these kinds of things will continue in the future.;We are consulting very closely with our allies. When our hostages were seized, when the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, the first step I took was to consult with other like-minded nations to deal with these threats to peace and with international terrorism.;But it would be ill-advised, I think, for me to specify particular things that we are talking to them about now. We are trying to carry out the United Nations desire, as expressed by overwhelming votes, in dealing with both these matters, and to strengthen countries that might be threatened, and to alleviate tensions that exist because of the Soviet invasion and the capture of our hostages. But as far as specific commitments, it would be better not to speak about them until we can permit the other allies to speak for themselves.;Q. Could I just follow that up briefly? Do you think the Soviet Union has been surprised by the reaction to their;THE PRESIDENT. My opinion is that they have been surprised not only by the trade restraints that I have imposed but also by 'the overwhelming condemnation voted by the U.N. I think the Soviets felt that they could take this action with just a minimal adverse reaction. I consider it to be more serious than their suppression of the uprising, for instance, in Czechoslovakia 10 or 11 years ago, in 1969, because this was an independent country, a nonaligned country, a deeply religious country that the Soviets went into with invading forces and subjugated. This is quite a radical departure from what they had done in the years since the Second World War.;And it has much greater strategic implications for us, with its threat to Pakistan, with its threat to Iran, with its threat to 90 percent of the exportable oil supplies in the world. And my belief is, based on evidence, that the Soviets have been somewhat chastened and surprised by the strong reaction in the other nations in the world, as exemplified by the U.N. vote, and also that other countries have rallied along with us to lead action that would restrain the Soviets repeating this in the future.;I don't know what the future holds, but I'm resolved not to back off on our commitment to hold the Soviets responsible for what they've done.;GRAIN SALES EMBARGO;Q. Mr. President, I'm from Iowa, Sioux City—27 miles from Lemars. Secretary Bergland—;THE PRESIDENT. Would you like to take my seat at the head of the table? [Laughter];Q. Secretary Bergland just returned from a rather extensive trip into Iowa, talking about the grain embargo. What type of report did he give to you upon his return to Washington?;THE PRESIDENT. To simplify an answer I'd say two things: one, the evident interest of the Iowa farmers in my administration's commitment not to let them suffer because of the interruption of grain sales to the Soviet Union—and Bergland's belief is that he adequately reassured them, as evidenced by the stability of the present grain market, secondly, the high degree of patriotism and support that was evident among the Iowa people for the action that we took against the Soviet Union.;ENERGY POLICY;Q. You and other people seem to have had a tough time persuading the American people that there really is an energy crisis and that they really ought to do something about it in terms of conservation. It seemed that immediately after the hostages were taken in Iran that there would have been support to take really drastic conservation methods, in cutting back our imports of petroleum. Why wasn't such an effort undertaken at that time?;THE PRESIDENT. Well, the effort is ongoing. I can only take action commensurate with my authority. The Congress now has three major bills that are being considered that will conclude the major portion of a comprehensive energy policy that I think will be almost adequate. All three of those bills have passed the House and the Senate. All three of those bills are in separate conference committees for final resolution, and I anticipate that they will be adequate enough for my signature.;There is one unmet need, and that is authority that I must have for the imposition of gasoline rationing. The present bill does authorize the Secretary of Energy to prepare a rationing plan, and he's working on that fervently. But the law as presently passed, which I signed this past year, requires that there be a 20-percent shortage of gasoline before rationing is imposed. A 20-percent shortage of gasoline in our country would be quite damaging to our economy, so I would like to remove that 20-percent requirement..;We have had the first evidence that the new energy policy is being effective. Now, for instance, gasoline consumption in our Nation is about 7 or 8 percent less than it was a year ago. There's been an almost radical turning away of American motorists from the very large, wasteful automobiles toward more efficient automobiles, as you know. And in fact, in 1979 we imported 5 percent less oil than the previous year—that's the total crude oil imported-which was contrary to a spiraling increase which had been evident in years before that.;With the decontrol of natural gas being assured over a long, carefully phased period of time, we've had much more plentiful supplies of natural gas throughout the Nation, more production and more plentiful supplies. And the phased decontrol of oil, in my opinion, will enhance the production of domestic oil. We now have more oil drilling rigs, natural gas drilling rigs combined, in operation than we've had in the last 21 years. And I think there's a new sense of urgency extant in the Nation, which will be mirrored in the Congress, because of the Iranian and Afghanistan threats.;So, I believe that we are now doing about as much as can be done. But Congress must act expeditiously and give me additional authority to ration gas if I consider it to be necessary.;1980 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN;Q. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has been quoted in Iowa, after the Des Moines Register-Tribune came out with 57 percent in favor of you, as saying you would have to win by 57 or it would be a bad defeat. [Laughter] Closer to home, in New Hampshire, he said a winner is the person who wins.;THE PRESIDENT. Yes.;Q. Now, I'm from Massachusetts, and I'd just like to know how much do you think he's going to have to win by in Massachusetts to show he's a winner close to home. [Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. I think he made the more accurate analysis closer to home.;I don't know. To me the election results have always been an indication of who won: the one who gets the most delegates or the most votes ordinarily is considered to be the one who wins. I don't know how to comment any further than that.;I don't know what's going to happen in Iowa. I don't know what's going to happen in Massachusetts or New Hampshire. We'll just have to judge each one as it comes.;Q. Are you hopeful, Mr. President?;THE PRESIDENT. Oh, yes. I've always been confident. [Laughter];CUBAN TROOP ACTIVITY;Q. I'm Bill Bayer from Miami. A number of us in south Florida keep looking just a hundred-odd miles away, and there's Castro still exporting his troops for the Russians. And there—in fact, what triggered my question was a cartoon in the Miami News, from the Dayton Daily News, that shows you calling Brezhnev. And you ask Brezhnev on the phone, "Why are Russian troops invading Afghanistan?" And Brezhnev says, "All the Cubans were busy." [Laughter];THE PRESIDENT. Yes, I saw that.;Q. But the point is that Castro is still exporting his revolution to Grenada. That was one of the votes against us in the U.N., right, and Cuba? And he's got his cherished squads in Jamaica, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Nicaragua, Jamaica, as far as we know, Panama, all over. The thought keeps occurring to a number of us who live down there next to Castro: why can't we blockade Cuba until the Russians, say, they can't get in, they can't get out until Castro brings his troops home. And then the Russians will have to send their own troops in place of Castro's troops—and are wondering about why we can't.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, a blockade is really—I think it would be considered the same as a declaration of war against Cuba. As you know, we imposed a blockade temporarily, began to impose one, when the Russian missiles were there, early in the 1960's. And then we withdrew the blockade when the Russian missiles designed to.attack our own country were removed, retaining thereafter an embargo of trade with Cuba.;I'm also concerned about Cuba's adventurism, not only in Latin America but in Africa, in Angola, and also, as you know, in the northeastern corner of Africa, in the Horn, particularly in Ethiopia. But I don't believe it would be advisable for us to try to establish a blockade around Cuba. This, I think, would be unwarranted at the present time.;My own sense about Cuba is not one of fear, but one of deep concern, and the arousing of public opinion against Cuba. Cuba had a very severe setback, in my opinion, when they failed to get even the full support of the nonaligned countries in their effort to be a member of the Security Council. And we have, I think, the right attitude toward Cuba and the Soviet Union. One is a deep concern about Cuba's effort to intrude in other countries, an awareness of their limited success in this hemisphere, because people know them by their stripes, and third, a decision which I have perpetuated from previous Presidents, that we not go to war with Cuba by trying to impose a blockade around them.;Q. In following up on that, do you think then that Cuba will ever bring its troops home?;THE PRESIDENT. I don't know. Angola, for instance, the leaders of Angola, both the present President and the previous one, Neto, who died, said that when Namibia was given its independence, and South African troops got away from their southern border, then the need for Cuban troops would no longer be extant. You can take that or leave it. I'm not convinced that that's an accurate analysis, but I think that the likelihood of Cuba as to having an early withdrawal of their troops and bringing them home is unlikely.;My hope is that the countries that have welcomed into their borders Cuban troops and have signed the so-called peace and friendship agreements with the Soviet Union have seen in the Afghanistan situation the threat to their own independence. I don't think that it's accurate to say that Angola is an independent country as long as they've got thirty or forty thousand Cuban troops there. And I don't think that Ethiopia has any sure belief any longer that if they wanted Russian and Cuban troops to leave that they would indeed leave.;My belief is and my hope is that many of the nonaligned countries that previously did give support to Castro and quite often voted, almost always, with the Soviet Union and against the Western democratic nations have now reversed themselves, because they see that the real threat to them is not democracy, it's not freedom, but it's the totalitarian influence of Cuba and the Soviet Union.;I believe the other nations of the world are learning their lesson—the hard way, in the case of Afghanistan. But it has been a very vivid lesson that I think will lessen in the future the willingness of those countries to have Cuban troops within their borders.;Ms. BARIO. Thank you, sir.;THE PRESIDENT. Thank you. We have just a moment. As you all leave I'd like to stand by the door and shake hands and thank everyone for coming, and maybe get a photograph.</td></tr>

Governor Graham and members of the board of trustees of the Caribbean/Central American Action, ladies and gentlemen;It's a great opportunity for us to be together, and it's a pleasure for me to welcome you here to the White House.;We have before us an exciting and extremely important new enterprise. I know you've spent time today discussing what might be accomplished in the future and some of the elements that comprise the circumstances under which we will be working together, not only among ourselves but with literally thousands of other Americans who share our interest in the Caribbean region, including the islands and the countries of Central America.;Tonight marks what I think will be a significant new effort to forge bonds of friendship between the people of the United States of America and our neighbors to the south. Bob Graham has named this group Caribbean/Central American Action, and the emphasis, as you well know, is on the word "action." This is important to us, because what we do will go far beyond good intentions or even good speeches or public statements. We're looking for results, exemplified by lasting friendships both between nations and between people.;This action group represents a coming together of two concerns: first, our shared concern about the vital importance of the entire Caribbean region—that concern and interest has been growing lately—and secondly, a recognition that the friendship on a people-to-people basis must be the foundation for any progress that we envision taking place.;Let me say just a few words about each one of these aspects of our interest. The United States is one of a large number of nations and peoples who are washed by the waters of the Caribbean. We are a Caribbean nation just as surely as we are an Atlantic nation or a Pacific nation. Geographically, it's not only the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, but it's also other States as well, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas are Caribbean States.;The cultures of our regions enrich one another—language, shared music, a common interest in sports, a common historical background, a common realization of the opportunities for the future. The ties of blood kinship are very strong, and this can be a basis on which we predicate future progress. Members of the same immediate family share citizenship and residence here in our country and citizenship and residence in every other one of the nations in the Caribbean region.;We recognize the extreme strategic importance of the region. This is not of importance only to the United States, but every one of the nations in whom we are interested also must share that common strategic interest and importance. Our security is related one to another.;The waters of the Caribbean touch more than 20 independent nations and more than a half-dozen dependencies. And as you know, the formation of new nations has been an almost explosive and a very exciting event in the last few years, and in the next few years as well. Except for us and Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia, the other nations are relatively small, but each one is important in its own right.;The economies of this area are quite vulnerable to international or global price structures and actions taken on a multinational basis outside the region. Many of these countries are heavily dependent on one or two or very few commodities. And when the prices for their products are set outside the borders of their own country, there is a tendency to blame all domestic problems on outside forces. This causes people to want to lash out or to distrust outsiders. It creates instability, and it also makes possible the intrusion of alien forces into a country who do not have the best interests of the people as a prime consideration.;The exploitation of dissatisfaction and the desire for change is a recognized fact. These factors have created an open avenue for Cuban adventurism—a Cuba supported by and encouraged by, financed by the Soviet Union. We tend to misunderstand the threat of Cuba. Certainly they contribute to violence and instability in the Caribbean region, but the real threat of Cuba is that they claim to offer a model to be emulated by people who are dissatisfied with their own lot or who are struggling to change things for the better. Cuba's promise, as you well know, is an empty one, just as Cuba's claimed independence is a myth. The inability of Cuban leaders to breathe one critical word of Soviet imperialism, even refraining from criticizing the Soviets' actual invasion of Afghanistan, shows a total absence of independence on the part of Cuba.;As you know, the Soviets prop up Cuba's bankrupt economy with an infusion of several millions of dollars every day. Moreover, Cuba is the only nation on Earth, I believe, that is more dependent on one major commodity now than it was 20 years ago. The stagnation there is debilitating indeed. And we see the hunger of many people on that island to escape political deprivation of freedom and also economic adversity. Our heart goes out to the almost 10,000 freedom-loving Cubans who entered a temporarily opened gate at the Peruvian Embassy just within this week.;We have a concern, yes, about Cuba's threatening role in the Caribbean, but our overriding interest is not to respond to threats of this kind. Our overriding interest must be the well-being, the unselfish relationship between Americans of all kinds and the people who live in that troubled region, but important region.;They're not the only ones who are troubled. Our country, as you well know, shares the same problems, the same troubles of excessive dependence on outside energy, on excessive inflation rates, on relatively high unemployment rates, on a common desire for security, on a struggle to exemplify in our own lives the principles and ideals which we hold so precious. We're not a big brother setting a perfect example in a perfect society for others who are less fortunate than we. We share with our neighbors to the south the same basic problems and also, most importantly, the same basic opportunities.;This is a time when people who suffer under dictatorships of the left and the right want a free voice to express their displeasure and their urging for change, and we are concerned when they're deprived of a right to speak or to act in their own best interest.;Democracy is a vital force in the Caribbean region. We want to encourage that vital force. We've seen tangible evidence in the Caribbean and the South American region of an improvement in the turning toward democracy by many peoples there, in the Dominican Republic, for instance, in the 1978 election-first time in the history of that country when there had been a peaceful change of administration brought about by open and free elections. In Saint Vincent and Saint Kitts/Nevis, the recent elections have also demonstrated that democracy works. In some, there've been temporary setbacks—in Suriname and in Grenada, for instance—but we hope that that interruption will be temporary.;I'd like to say that Central America, as contrasted with the Caribbean, is going through an even more turbulent time right now, when political polarization increases. The advocates of peaceful and democratic change become the targets of both extremes from the right and the left. This is happening in El Salvador. We're deeply concerned about occurrences there. It could happen other places. The Government of El Salvador is struggling with some very significant reforms in land ownership—one of the most sweeping land reform efforts that I have ever witnessed. And of course we know that this is an effort that both extremes of the right and left would like to see fail.;The challenge to us is to refrain from unwarranted intervention in the internal affairs of any other country, but in a completely proper and open way to help those who want to improve their own lifestyle, their own freedom, and their own economic well-being.;We ourselves are undergoing very rapid change. We're trying to reverse our dependence on imported oil. We are one of the players on the international scene, along with other countries. We're seeking to alter our ideas and develop better relationships with countries in the developing world. Throughout my own Presidency, we have increased our interest in democratic principles, human rights, and the individuality and the recognition of the importance of each particular country in this troubled region.;Since I was inaugurated, we have more than doubled aid to the Caribbean region. When the Congress completes action on the present aid program, which I think will pass, we will have nearly quadrupled our aid to Central America. And as you all know, this is a time of extraordinary budgetary restraint.;In addition to these bilateral efforts, we have encouraged the formation and worked very closely with 30 other nations and 15 international institutions to provide additional economic help for the Caribbean region—working with the World Bank and others. Multilateral assistance has increased fourfold between 1976 and 1980, from $110 million to more than $400 million in that brief period of time.;In short, we have put a high priority on a better aid program for the Caribbean • region and for Central America. Our values and our concerns require that we play an active role in this region. We've done a lot as a government. I need not go down any more details, but I would like to say that the relationship between our countries is shaped very slightly by actual, tangible, definite government action.;In many nations of the south, the "U.S. Government" itself is at least partially suspect—likely without good reason, on occasion with reason. And that's what makes it so important for us to expand what the Government can do in a limited way at the Federal level and encompass other elements of American life who can act more definitively and more effectively to magnify the beneficial influence of our great country among the nations and the peoples in the Caribbean region.;The talent, the scientific knowledge, the educational ability, the wealth, the technology of our country is not focused in the Federal Government. It's focused in farmers and workers and businesses and universities, in local governments, it's focused in churches, it's focused among civic groups who have a benevolent character. This is where the real strength of our country lies, and this is an opportunity for tapping the treasure of what the United States is to reach the goals that you are defining in this new entity. That's why we're here today.;I might say that we don't want to supplant the outstanding groups already devoted to similar purposes. We are not going to create a new bureaucracy. We're going to try to coordinate, as best we can, those groups already doing such a wonderful job, build on them, and bring in other thousands of Americans to help us with this common purpose. We're interested in dignity, development, and democracy.;Dignity, to be derived in the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of our neighbors who know for a fact, because we are sincere, that we value them, that we want them to have a better life, that we want them to trust us with good reason, not because we have any selfish intent to exploit them as a customer or even as a political ally, but because we know for certain that they and we share common opportunities and common purposes.;Development, not in the form of huge projects perhaps, but community-type interrelationships that can be derived only with a clear understanding of their opportunities and their needs—here again, there is no way to separate the mutuality of benefit to be derived.;And democracy, not trying to foist on others an exact replica of our own government, but to demonstrate by how we act and what we do that our way of life, based on freedom, based on the value of the individual, is worthy of free adoption by others through their own exercise of their own judgment.;Many of you have spent a good part of the day discussing these issues, I know that. But we ought not to forget that everyone here ought to be the core of an enlarging group to encourage diversity of ideas and actions. Each one of you can very quickly think of 10 different organizations or 100 different people that might very well be interested in a particular aspect of people-to-people relationships that would build on friendship, or a business or other relationship that would give us mutually a better life. And I hope that the universities and the churches and the professional groups and others will search diligently for new opportunities for the future.;I happen to be particularly interested in the Friendship Force, because Rosalynn and I organized it while I was Governor of Georgia. We had a sister state in Latin America, and we would send back and forth every year two or three hundred Georgians to live in private homes, and that same state would send two or three hundred of their people to live in the private homes in Georgia. It never got a nickel of any government money, and it provided an exciting new dimension of knowledge of one another. And we've tried to bring that now to the Federal level.;Obviously, there are many other ideas that can be built upon or created. The Partners of the Americas have tremendous experience that can permeate this entire organization, all aspects of what we do, for the better. And of course, the Sister Cities program is another that can be expanded rapidly to encompass the people who live in the Caribbean region. A mission on agriculture is now underway, with Dr. E. T. York heading it up. And I hope that all these groups and many others will make a beneficial impact among our people and to the south.;The last point I want to make is this: We ought always to remember and let our thoughts and our actions exemplify the fact that the benefits to be derived are reciprocal. We're not embarking on this effort to do other people a favor as a handout from a more rich and more powerful neighbor. We should remember that this is a two-way street or a three-way street. We could get many people involved in these kinds of programs. It's a mutual exchange. If we are to speak to others, then we must be equally eager to listen. If we are to teach, we must be equally eager to learn. And if we are to deliver, then we must also be willing to receive, which may perhaps be the most difficult of all.;I've written every one of the heads of state in this region. I've met with several groups here at the White House and over in the Cabinet Room. The response has been very enthusiastic. I think the Caribbean, including us and other nations, are ready for accomplishment of these goals. We want to reach out and make sure that we don't fail.;This is a time when we can let this effort exemplify the finest aspects of American life. And if and when our effort is successful, then it can serve as a pattern, modified considerably or slightly, for the beneficial extension of American hands of warmth and hearts of friendship to other people throughout the world. It's kind of a test case. With your leadership and your support, with full participation by me when you request and the entire administration here, I have no doubt that we will succeed.;This is not a government program, it is your program. And I hope that each one of you will feel equally as responsible for leadership and for inspiration and for innovation as I myself feel or as your leader, Bob Graham, feels. There is no limit to what we can achieve together, and I stand ready and eager to help in any way possible.;Thank you very much.;GOVERNOR GRAHAM. Mr. President, those words captured the spirit of the challenge that is before us. This is a classic example of an idea and time meeting at the present moment. The enthusiasm which has been demonstrated by the trustees, the citizens, those who have indicated a desire to support this effort today, is illustrative of that American spirit that we hope to capture and mobilize and direct towards the common good of the peoples of this great section of our planet.;We are going to be looking to the men and women who are here today and many others to provide the tangible and the intangible resources that will make this project successful. We have talked previously with some of you about the kinds of concerns that we have and the needs that we have. We hope that you will be attentive and generous in your response.</td></tr>

After having complied with Section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112), and having made the required determinations, I notified Congress of my intention to enter into the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (a copy of which is annexed to this proclamation as Part 1 of Annex I), and an implementing bill, approving the agreement and the proposed administrative action, has been enacted into law (Section 2(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147)).;5. (a) Pursuant to Section 2(b) (3) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147), I determine (1) that each major industrial country, as defined therein, with the exception of Canada, is accepting the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, (2) that the acceptance of this Agreement by Canada is not essential to the effective operation of the Agreement, (3) that a significant portion of United States trade will benefit from the Agreement, notwithstanding such nonacceptance, and (4) that it is in the national interest of the United States to accept the Agreement (and have so reported to the Congress);(b) Pursuant to Section 204(a) (2) (A) and (B) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 203), I determine that the European Communities (including the European Economic Community) have accepted the obligations of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with respect to the United States and each of the member states of the European Communities has implemented the Agreement under its laws (effective July 1, 1980);(c) Pursuant to Section 503(a)(1) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251), I determine, after interested parties were provided an opportunity to comment, that the articles classifiable in the following new items of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), added thereto by Annex II to this proclamation, were not imported into the United States before January 1, 1978, and were not produced in the United States before May 1, 1978;402.54 405.70 409.76 411.74;402.82 405.82 409.84 411.86;403.14 406.09 409.92 411.96;403.59 406.42 410.02 412.04;403.66 406.58 410.10 412.12;404.30 406.63 410.18 412.36;404.38 407.07 410.22 412.40;404.47 408.23 410.34 412.50;404.90 408.29 411.10 412.66;405.09 408.38 411.42 412.70;405.34 409.28 411.50 413.30;405.62 409.68 411.58;(d) Pursuant to Section 503(a)(2) (A) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251), I determine, after providing interested parties an opportunity to comment, that each article identified in Annex IV to this proclamation is not import sensitive.;6. Each modification of existing duty proclaimed herein which provides with respect to an article for a decrease in duty below the limitation specified in Sections 101 (b) (1) or 109(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(b)(1) or 2119 (a)), and each modification of any other import restriction or tariff provision so proclaimed is authorized by one or more of the following provisions or statutes;(a) Section 101(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.G. 2111(b) (2)), by virtue of the fact that the rate of duty existing on January 1, 1975, applicable to the article was not more than 5 percent ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent);(b) Section 109(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2119 (b)), by virtue of the fact that I have determined, pursuant to that section, that the decrease authorized by that section will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to the article, and;(c) The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 144 et seq.) including, but not limited to, Sections 503(a)(1), (2)(A) and (6) (93 Stat. 251 and 252) by virtue of the fact that they permit departures from the staging provisions of Section 109(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2119(a)).;7. In the case of each decrease in duty, including those of the type specified in clause (a) or (b) of the sixth recital of this proclamation, which involves the determination of the ad valorem equivalent of a specific or compound rate of duty, and in the case of each modification in the form of an import duty, the United States International Trade Commission has determined, pursuant to Section 601(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2481 (4)), in accordance with Section 4(e) of Executive Order No. 11846 of March 27, 1975 (3 CFR 1971-1975 Comp. 973), and at my direction, the ad valorem equivalent of the specific or compound rate, on the basis of the value of imports of the article concerned during a period determined by it to be representative, utilizing, to the extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in Sections 402 and 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a and 1402) applicable to the article during such representative period.;8. Pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974 and the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, I determine that each modification or continuance of existing duties or other import restrictions and each continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment hereinafter proclaimed is required or appropriate to carry out the trade agreements identified in the third recital of this proclamation or the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.;Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including but not limited to Title I and Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, Section 2 and Titles II and V of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, do proclaim that;(1) (a) The valuation standards amendments made by Title II of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 194 et seq.) to Sections 402 and 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a and 1402), and;(b) subject to the provisions of the General Agreement, of the Geneva (1979) Protocol, of other agreements supplemental to the General Agreement, of the other agreements identified in recitals 3 and 4, and of United States law (including but not limited to provisions for more favorable treatment),?;(i) the modification or continuance of existing duties or other import restrictions, and;(ii) the continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment provided for in these agreements and in trade agreements legislation, shall become effective on or after July 1, 1980, as provided for herein.(2) To this end?;(a) The amendments made by Title II of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 194 et seq.), except amendments made by section 223 (b), shall be effective with respect to articles exported to the United States on and after July 1, 1980;(b) The TSUS is modified as provided in Annexes II, III and IV of this proclamation;(c) The modifications to the TSUS made by Sections A and C of Annex II, and Section A of Annex III, of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles exported to the United States on and after the effective dates specified in those annexes;(d) The modifications to the TSUS made by Sections B, D and E of Annex II, Section B of Annex III, and Sections A and B of Annex IV, of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after the effective dates specified in those annexes;(e) The United States Trade Representative shall make the necessary determinations relevant to the designation of the effective dates of the modifications of the TSUS made by Sections F and G of Annex II and Section C of Annex III to this proclamation, and shall publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER the effective date with respect to each of the modifications made by these sections, such modifications shall apply to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after such effective date;(f) With respect to the modifications to the TSUS made by Annex IV to this proclamation and Annex IV to Presidential Proclamation 4707 of December 11, 1979, relating to special treatment for the least developed developing countries (LDDC's), whenever the rate of duty specified in the column numbered 1 for any TSUS item is reduced to the same level as the corresponding rate of duty specified in the column entitled "LDDC" for such item, or to a lower level, the rate of duty in the column entitled "LDDC" shall be deleted from the TSUS;(g) Annexes III and IV of Presidential Proclamation 4707 of December 11, 1979, are superseded to the extent inconsistent with this proclamation.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.;JIMMY CARTER</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c2"><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=42275&st=dominican&st1=" target="blank">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=42275&st=dominican&st1=</a></td><td class="c5">Ronald Reagan: Message to the Congress Transmitting Proposed Caribbean Basin Initiative Legislation</td><td class="c6">March 17, 1982</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;On February 24, before the Organization of American States, I outlined a major new program for economic cooperation for the Caribbean Basin. Today I am transmitting this plan to the Congress for its action.;The economic, political and security challenges in the Caribbean Basin are formidable. Our neighbors need time to develop representative and responsive institutions, which are the guarantors of the democracy and justice that freedom's foes seek to stamp out. They also need the opportunity to achieve economic progress and improve their standard of living. Finally, they need the means to defend themselves against attempts by externally-supported minorities to impose an alien, hostile and unworkable system upon them by force. The alternative is further expansion of political violence from the extreme left and the extreme right, resulting in the imposition of dictatorships and—inevitably—more economic decline, and more human suffering and dislocation.;Today, I seek from the Congress the means to address the economic aspect of the challenge in the Caribbean Basin—the underlying economic crisis which provides the opportunities which extremist and violent minorities exploit.;The crisis facing most of the Basin countries is real and acute. Deteriorating trade opportunities, worldwide recession, mounting debt burdens, growing unemployment and deep-seated structural problems are having a catastrophic impact throughout the region. This economic disaster is consuming our neighbors' money reserves and credit, forcing thousands of people to emigrate, and shaking even the most established democracies.;This is not a crisis we can afford to ignore. The people of the Caribbean Basin are our neighbors. Their well-being and security are in our own vital interest. Events occurring in the Caribbean Basin can affect our lives in profound and dramatic ways. The migrants in our midst are a vivid reminder of the closeness of this problem to all of us.;The program I am presenting to Congress today is integrated and designed to improve the lives of the peoples of the Caribbean Basin by enabling them to earn their own way to a better future. It builds on the principles of integrating aid, self-help and participation in trade and investment which I emphasized at the Cancun Summit last October. It is a different kind of assistance program for developing countries, based on principles and practices which are uniquely American and which we know have worked in the past. It will help revitalize the economies of this strategically critical region by attacking the underlying causes of economic stagnation. Most significantly, it helps expand economic opportunities for the people of the Caribbean Basin to make possible the achievement of a lasting political and social tranquillity based on freedom and justice.;I want to emphasize that this program is not an end in itself. What we seek in the final analysis is to help the people in the Basin build for themselves a better life, not just economically but across the full spectrum of human needs and aspirations. History, and particularly the history of this Hemisphere, has shown that a pluralistic society with strong, free private institutions-churches, free trade unions, businesses, professional and other voluntary associations, and an independent press—is our best hope in moving toward that ultimate goal.;Our development program takes this into account, it will encourage progress in the beneficiary countries toward reasonable workplace conditions and opportunities for workers to associate freely and bargain collectively.;The United States has been developing this program in close consultation with the countries of the region and with other donor countries. Last July, we joined with Canada, Mexico and Venezuela to launch a multilateral action program for the region. It was agreed that each country would develop its own program but within a multilateral consultative framework. Mexico and Venezuela are operating an oil facility for the Caribbean Basin. Canada is more than doubling its aid. The program I am presenting today is our contribution.;We have worked carefully with both government officials and the private sector in the Basin countries to assess their needs and their own priorities. We have also consulted with other potential donors, including Colombia, as well as multilateral development institutions. This program is part of an overall coordinated effort by countries within and outside the region. Its structure will ensure not only that our own actions will be effective, but that their impact will be multiplied by the efforts of many others.;The program is based on integrated and mutually-reinforcing measures in the fields of trade, investment and financial assistance;—Its centerpiece is the offer of one-way free trade. I am requesting authority to eliminate duties on all imports from the Basin except textiles and apparel items subject to textile agreements. The only other limitation will be for sugar, as long as a sugar price support program is in effect, duty-free imports of sugar will be permitted only up to specified ceilings. Safeguards will be available to U.S. industries seriously injured by increased Basin imports. Rules of origin will be liberal to encourage investment but will require a minimum amount of local content (25 percent). I will designate beneficiary countries taking into account such factors as the countries' self-help policies.;—I am proposing an extension of the 10 percent tax credit that now applies only to domestic investment to new equity investments in qualifying Caribbean Basin countries. A country would qualify for the benefit for a period of five years by entering into a bilateral executive agreement with the U.S. to exchange information for tax administration purposes.;—I am requesting a supplemental appropriation for the FY 1982 foreign assistance program in the amount of $350 million in emergency economic assistance. This assistance will help make possible financing of critical imports for the private sector in Basin countries experiencing a severe credit crunch. I expect to allocate the emergency supplemental in the region as follows;El Salvador: $128 million. El Salvador's economy is in desperate straits. The insurgents have used every tactic of terrorism to try to destroy it. El Salvador desperately needs as much assistance to stimulate production and employment as we can prudently provide while also helping other countries of the region.;Costa Rica: $70 million. Costa Rica has a long tradition of democracy which is now being tested by the turmoil of its economy. Once Costa Rica has embarked on a recovery plan, it will need significant assistance to succeed in restoring investor confidence and credit to its hard-hit private sector.;Honduras: $35 million. The poorest country in the Central American region, Honduras faces severe balance of payments constraints, spawned primarily from falling prices of major exports and rising import costs.;Jamaica: $50 million. Jamaica's recovery is under way but continued success is still heavily dependent on further quick-disbursing assistance to overcome a shortage of foreign exchange for raw materials and spare parts.;Dominican Republic: $40 million. The Dominican Republic is attempting to adjust to drastically-reduced economic activity brought on primarily by falling prices of its major export crop (sugar) and heavy dependence on imported oil. Critical economic reforms must take place in a difficult political climate as elections grow near. Once the free trade provisions go into effect, the Dominican Republic will also receive as a result of the duty-free quota for its sugar exports immediate benefits going beyond the $40 million indicated here.;Eastern Caribbean: $10 million. Economic stagnation has dried up investment and strangled development in these island ministates where unemployment is a particular problem, especially among youths.;Belize: $10 million. Newly-independent Belize faces a perilous economic situation brought on by falling sugar prices and stagnant growth. Belize needs short-term assistance as a bridge to the development of its own considerable natural resources.;Haiti: $5 million. Illegal immigration from Haiti is spurred by stagnant economic activity and a credit-starved private sector in a country already desperately poor.;Latin American Regional/American Institute for Labor Development (AIFLD): $2 million. Free labor movements, assisted by our small AIFLD programs, can be the underpinning of a healthy private sector and its ability to expand and grow, leading the region to stable social and economic progress.;In a separate action I am also requesting action on the economic assistance program for FY 1983. This includes $664 million in economic assistance for the Caribbean Basin. This program will be directed largely into longer-term programs aimed at removing basic impediments to growth. Although not a part of the legislation which I am transmitting today, the FY 1983 aid request is an integral part of our overall program for the Caribbean Basin. We cannot think of this program as a one-time injection of U.S. interest and effort. If it is to succeed it must be a sustained commitment over a number of years. I strongly urge the Congress to approve this request in full.;In addition to these legislative requests, I am directing the following actions, which are within the discretion of the Executive Branch;—We will extend more favorable treatment to Caribbean Basin textile and apparel exports within the context of our overall textile policy.;—We will seek to negotiate bilateral investment treaties with interested countries.;—We will work with multilateral development banks and the private sector to develop insurance facilities to supplement OPIC's political risk insurance coverage for U.S. investors.;—The U.S. Export-Import Bank will expand protection, where its lending criteria allow, for short-term credit from U.S. banks, as well as local commercial banks, to Caribbean Basin private sectors for critical imports.;—With the governments and private sectors of interested countries, we will develop private sector strategies for each country. These strategies will coordinate and focus development efforts of local business, U.S. firms, private voluntary organizations, the U.S. Government, and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The strategies will seek new investment and employment opportunities and will also seek to remove impediments to growth including lack of marketing skills, trained manpower, poor regional transport, and inadequate infrastructure.;Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have a long-standing special relationship with the United States. Their development must be enhanced by our policy toward the rest of the region. We have consulted closely with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands about the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the legislation I am requesting today will reflect Puerto Rican and Virgin Island interests in many important ways.;—The Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) and the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) will be extended to property used by companies operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Similar benefits will be available to other U.S. possessions.;—Excise taxes on all imported rum will be transferred to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.;—Inputs into Caribbean Basin production from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will be considered domestic inputs from Caribbean Basin countries for purposes of the rules of origin.;—Industries in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands will have access to the same safeguards provisions as mainland industries.;In addition, we will support proposed legislation which will permit products from the Virgin Islands whose foreign content does not exceed 70 percent to receive duty-free treatment. At present the maximum foreign content permitted is 50 percent.;To further the integrated agricultural development of the Caribbean Basin, we will make greater use of the agricultural and forestry research, extension and training facilities of the Federal Government and those of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, especially the tropical agricultural research facility at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.;All these elements in the Caribbean Basin program are inextricably linked together, and to the fundamental objective of helping our neighbors help themselves. A key principle of the program is to encourage a more productive, competitive and dynamic private sector, and thereby provide the jobs, goods and services which the people of the Basin need for a better life for themselves and their children. All the elements of this program are designed to help establish the conditions under which a free and competitive private sector can flourish.;Most countries in the Basin already recognize that they must reform many of their economic policies and structures in profound and sometimes painful ways in order to take advantage of the new economic opportunities of this program. We—the United States and other outside donors-can offer assistance and support, but only the people in the Basin themselves can make this program work.;Some of the benefits of this program will take considerable time to mature, others are designed to have an immediate effect. But the challenge is already upon us, the time to begin is now. I urge the Congress to act with maximum speed.;I also urge the Congress to consider very carefully any changes in this program. The actions in trade, aid and investment are inter-related. Each supports the other, so that together they comprise a real spur toward the entrepreneurial dynamism which the area so badly needs. A significant weakening in any of them could undermine the whole program.;In the Caribbean Basin, we seek above all to support those values and principles that shape the proud heritage of this Nation and this Hemisphere. With the help of this Congress, we shall see these values not only survive but triumph in a Caribbean Basin which is a community of peace, freedom and prosperity.;RONALD REAGAN;The White House;March 17, 1982.</td></tr>

The U.S. Trade Representative or his designee may allocate this quantity among supplying countries or areas, and may prescribe further rules, regulations, limitations or prohibitions on the entry of sugar in accordance with the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, and Public Law 96-236. The U.S. Trade Representative or his designee shall inform the Commissioner of Customs of any such action regarding the importation of sugar, and shall publish notice thereof in the Federal Register.;(h) For the purposes of this headnote, the term "raw value" means the equivalent of such articles in terms of ordinary commercial raw sugar testing 96 degrees by the polariscope as determined in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may, among other things, provide: (1) for the entry of such articles pending a final determination of polarity, and (2) that positive or negative adjustments for differences in preliminary and final raw values be made in the same or succeeding quota periods. The principal grades and types of sugar shall be translated into terms of raw value in the following manner;(i) For articles described in item 155.20, by multiplying the number of pounds thereof by the greater of 0.93, or 1.07 less 0.0175 for each degree of polarization under 100 degrees (and fractions of a degree in proportion).;(ii) For articles described in item 155.30, by multiplying the number of pounds of the total sugars thereof (the sum of the sucrose and reducing or invert sugars) by 1.07.;(iii) The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish methods for translating sugar into terms of raw value for any special grade or type of sugar for which he determines that the raw value cannot be measured adequately under the above provisions.;B.

Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome President Monge of Costa Rica.;Costa Rica is an old and valued friend of the United States. Its dramatic tradition has made that country a natural partner of the United States in the Caribbean and, in fact, in the whole hemisphere. Our meeting is in keeping with my policy of working very closely with our democratic friends in this hemisphere. And I most appreciated the President's views on his country's prospects and problems.;I personally pledge my administration's support for Costa Rica's effort at economic recovery. And I'm also deeply appreciative of the President's strong support for the Caribbean Basin Initiative and understand that he's going to make that support known to our Congress.;We discussed the prospects for democracy in the region. We noted that fair and free elections have been held this year in his own country, Costa Rica, and Colombia, where they've long been a tradition, and Honduras, El Salvador, and the Dominican Republic as well. We've also discussed the threat to this welcome development by forces of the extreme right and the extreme left, the latter aided and abetted by Nicaragua and Cuba.;We candidly assessed the inter-American system in light of the recent conflict in the South Atlantic. We agreed that the system and its ability to respond to threats to the peace must be strengthened and that this required our urgent attention.;And, finally, let me say again, it's been my great pleasure in meeting and talking with you, Mr. President. I look forward to our working together in the common problems that face us in this hemisphere, and. it's a pleasure to welcome you to America.;President Monge. I've expressed my deep appreciation to President Reagan for this invitation to come here in representation of the government and the people of Costa Rica. And I pointed out in my words of appreciation to the President that this was a great indication of the sympathy and the support for Costa Rican democracy, that is, the fact that this invitation was extended to me the very day that I took office this past May 8th.;It has been my privilege to come here to reiterate and to ratify an alliance that has existed from the very early days of our country with the United States of America. And so, this small democracy without an army has always been a sincere ally of this great power called the United States of America, because we have always identified with the ideals and the conceptions of freedom of justice and for the good of all of the peoples throughout the Earth.;And so, this alliance has become a matter of great importance for our countries throughout the past, but never more than now. In this dramatic occasion, its importance is of really dramatic significance, because we are caught in a pincer now—that is, the democratic forces—between the extremes of political thinking now more than ever before. I have conveyed to President Reagan the harsh realities of our present economic and social crisis and a true information as to the fact that there is, indeed, a massive offensive on the part of totalitarian Marxism-Leninism in the area of Central America and the Caribbean.;I have repeated to President Reagan our need for solidarity and for assistance in order to enable us to overcome these economic difficulties and social problems that we are undergoing at the present time and in order to preserve in peace this democratic base which is Costa Rica.;And so, I confirm that in order to defend democracy, something that is one of my deep convictions—that in order to defend democracy, the best tool we have in this unceasing struggle is an unceasing struggle against poverty, a struggle in favor of social justice, a struggle for economic growth. And I believe that no matter how harsh or difficult the circumstances may be, that we, as I told President Reagan, feel optimistic. And I think that at the end of the day that the validity of these concepts in the conscience of our peoples will be intact, that is, these shared ideals of freedom, of justice, and of peace that have always been defended by the people of the United States and the people of Costa Rica.;Thank you very much, President Reagan, for having accepted my ratification of this alliance between tiny Costa Rica and the powerful United States for the continuation of the struggle for freedom and justice for the good of our peoples.</td></tr>

It is my hope that the compromise will be supported by a large majority of the members of the committee. The bill will authorize the full amount of our request of $350 million. A total of $100 million would be authorized for El Salvador, with $20 million of this for support of that country's land reform program. While somewhat less than our original request, this $100 million will provide a vital boost to the Salvadoran economy and help to ensure continued progress in the political and economic reform in that country.;Additional amounts of assistance provided under this bill would go to Costa Rica, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, the island countries of the Eastern Caribbean, Haiti, Belize, and Guatemala.;Early action on the Caribbean Basin Initiative is a high priority for my administration. It is my hope the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate will give early and favorable consideration to this legislation. Favorable action in both Houses on the critical trade and investment initiatives of our program is also imperative.</td></tr>

You've come up with a wonderful way for all of us to express our support for strengthening Caribbean Basin economies.;I particularly want to thank the cochairmen, Frank Borman, who was just here, and Lee Kling, David Rockefeller, and Sam Segnar, the host committee, and all the supporters from business and voluntary organizations. And a special thanks to the delegates from the Caribbean and Central America.;Last February, in this same great Hall of the Americas, I spoke of my conviction that this hemisphere was a special place with a special destiny. The Caribbean Basin Initiative was launched to help our neighbors by the sea, some two dozen countries of the Caribbean Basin, to reach their full potential. We're talking about assistance to support a modern economy, but also, trade, investment, and commercial financing to develop the magic of the marketplace, the only hope for eventual escape from dependence to self-sustained growth.;Now, this is the United States part of a larger program that was worked out in cooperation with supporting countries in the region, such as Mexico, Canada, Venezuela, and Colombia, and by the countries represented by so many of you from the nations of the Caribbean. This is not a made-in-America program, it's a made-in-Americas program, as I told some of you this morning.;Our countries are neighbors, linked geographically, politically, economically, culturally, and strategically. We have our differences, as neighbors always do, but we can deal directly with and manage these differences because we're neighbors.;Our friends in the Caribbean now face grave economic problems and the political instability and sometimes subversion which inevitably feed on those problems. There is no quick solution. Recovery in the United States and world economies will help, but we must also think about and build for the longer term. That's why the countries of this region have pulled together to initiate this program.;With the Caribbean Basin Initiative we can open a window onto a different time, a different future—a future in which the creative energies of free individuals lead to prosperity and the freedom to choose their own destiny.;The CBI legislation is now before the Congress. I consider passage of that program a top priority. We need a farsighted act by our people now, a time of great economic trial for us as well, so we can prevent even greater expenditures of energy, time, and treasure in the future.;Our neighbors deserve our cooperation. We share a commitment to freedom and independence. The idea of democracy is strong there. Over two-thirds of the countries in the area are democracies. In Central America democracy has made great strides and inspired enthusiasm, as was clear in the massive vote in El Salvador.;Since I submitted the CBI program to the Congress in April, I've met with a number of leaders from the region—most recently, President Suazo of Honduras, President-elect Jorge Blanco of the Dominican Republic-and I know that the economic crisis in the area has worsened. We must act now, and I want you to know that I'm personally leading the effort to assure passage of this vitally needed legislation before the summer recess.;I welcome all the support that all of you can give us, and I, again, say thank you very much for being here and for your interest. God bless you, and have a wonderful evening.</td></tr>

Well, hello and welcome to all of you. It's wonderful to have you here and to see you joining in this important step forward for America.;Twenty-one months ago this country was in the grip of not one, but five severe problems: runaway government spending, double-digit inflation, record high interest rates—they'd just hit 21 1/2 percent—the worst tax burden in peacetime history, and high unemployment. With support from the American people we put in place a program that was designed to cure this raging economic disease which had been ignored for too many years. Little more than a year's passed since our program went on the books, but already we've made solid progress against four of the five problems that we inherited.;We have cut the growth of spending somewhere around in half, and we've reduced high inflation, high interest rates, and taxation. But let me just say something here about interest rates, which I'll expand on in my speech to the Nation tonight.;The very sharp and heartening decline that we've seen in interest rates brings us one step closer to the dream every American shares, which is lasting recovery. But let's understand that what brought, for example, Government-backed home mortgages down to 12 1/2 percent, the lowest level in 25 months, was not a quick fix, but our progress against inflation. The decline in inflation led directly to the fall in interest rates during the last several months. The Federal Reserve Bank announced last week that it was lowering its discount level to 9 1/2 percent. That's the first time this key interest rate has been a single digit since 1979 and the fifth reduction in the rate in 4 months.;The Fed's lower rate shows its confidence that inflation and market interest rates are continuing to fall. The Federal Reserve has been pursuing a steady policy of trying to reduce inflation, and we've been supporting the Fed in that policy. And the Fed will continue to aim its policy at bringing inflation down further in the future. And that will continue to mean lower and lower interest rates as well.;As I said, we're solving four of the five worst problems that we inherited. But unemployment, always the lagging indicator, remains too high, and clearly, our most urgent priority today is to create lasting, private sector jobs. I'm not going to rest until every American who wants a job can find a job.;Unemployment is a tragedy for all Americans in every region, every city, and every line of work. We need the strength of every back and the power of every mind to lift our nation from the economic swamp to higher ground. We must not waste the energy of one citizen who wants to work.;All of us are moved by the plight of millions of our people who can't find jobs or provide for their families. Perhaps the cruelest trap of all has caught the legions of our youth. As they stand on the threshold of the American dream, far too many find the door of opportunity slammed in their face. Two out of every five people out of work-two out of every five—are between the ages of 16 and 24.;We continue to push for enterprise zones in our inner cities, a program to attract new businesses and jobs to areas of highest unemployment. It's tragic that this enterprise zone proposal has been bottled up in committee by the leadership of the House.;I remember what it was like to be 21 years old and looking for a job in 1932. And I know how it feels when your future has been mortgaged by the generation before you. And that's a tragic mistake we must never allow our leaders to make again. Today's young people must never be held hostage to the mistakes of the past.;The only way to avoid making these mistakes again is to learn from them. It's estimated, for example, that at least 20 million American workers now rely on skills that won't be needed within 20 years. The government has trained thousands more in skills that already aren't needed in their communities. Still others have been steered into make-work government for our young people. And that's why I'm proud today to sign into law the Job Training Partnership Act, a program that looks to the future instead of the past.;This is not another make-work, dead-end, bureaucratic boondoggle. This program will train more than one million Americans every year in skills they can market where they live. It'll make a difference on Main Street. It'll provide help, bring hope, and encourage self-reliance and personal initiative. And here's how it'll work.;State and local government officials, business and labor leaders, and other members of the private sector will plan area programs in private industry councils. Local people will decide at the grass roots level what opportunities are available in their communities, and then match real jobs with needed skills.;And here's something else that makes this program different from many past failures. At least 70 percent of the program funds will go to actual job training. We're eliminating the bureaucratic and administrative waste that has marked so many so-called job bills in the past.;There's another reason for confidence in this measure. It's based on a tried and tested concept. The young people that are with me here today have already benefited from local programs very similar to the one we're about to enact nationwide. And I'm going to give some examples.;Emmanuel Clark—here a high school student from Richmond. He learned clerical skills and found a part-time job in a law firm because of New Horizons, a training program in this area.;Bienvenido Martinez, who came to the United States from the Dominican Republic, received on-the-job training sponsored by the Washington, D.C., Private Industry Council and now works part-time as a computer operator while attending college. A little while ago I told him what a change this was between generations, because I worked my way through college washing dishes in the girls' dormitory. [Laughter];And Paige Davis, who once supported three children on unemployment benefits, enrolled in the Urban League Word-Processing Training Program. She graduated in 1979, began work for the Booker T. Washington Foundation, and did so well that-she told me a little earlier—she's starting a business of her own as a consultant in word processing.;Now, these are just three examples of the opportunity this approach holds for millions of Americans. Long-time workers who've lost their jobs because of new technology, women who can't find work because their home-making skills aren't marketable, young people who aren't hired because they have no experience—all will be helped by this program.;And let me just add a special word of thanks to Senators Hatch and Quayle and Kennedy and Congressmen Jeffords, Erlenborn, and Hawkins for their leadership in getting this legislation passed.;And now, if you young people will just pay attention—or gather around close, I'm going to sign the bill. That's the bill. I only sign the last page.;[At this point, the President signed the bill.];Reporter. Well, you know the Democrats are calling this blatant election-year politics, Mr. President.;The President. That doesn't surprise me a bit. [Laughter] But it doesn't make it any more true.;Q. Is it true, Mr. President?;The President. What?;Q. Is it true?;The President. No.;Q. Why not?;The President. Because this is the type of program that we've been talking about that's really going to accomplish something.;Deputy Press Secretary Speakes. That's enough. It's not a press conference. I'm sorry.;The President. Isn't he mean? [Laughter] I was enjoying it.;Q. But you're free to continue, sir. [Laughter];Q. You're the President.;The President. No, I can't do that. But I want you to know though, as I say, all these young people are an example of what these kind of programs can do, and out there government has a legitimate function. But that legitimate function, I think, in this area means cooperating and working with the private sector, where the jobs with a future really are.;And thank you all for being here.</td></tr>

The power of the democratic idea and economic progress allowed the West to win the battle for the hearts and minds of people almost everywhere and helped them resist totalitarian ideologies. But isn't there an implicit threat to those gains in the present economic crisis and, therefore, to the strategic interests of the United States, even in the hemisphere?;The President. There is no question that today's global economic crisis is a severe challenge to democracies everywhere. During an economic downturn, competition among labor, business, and government becomes more intense, and the relationships can become strained. This, in part, is the reason why I proposed last February, in cooperation with other donor nations in the hemisphere, an ambitious program to increase aid and stimulate trade and investment in the Caribbean Basin. It is also why the U.S. has worked closely with the international community to assist countries which are facing more serious financial difficulties during the current worldwide recession.;The situation in El Salvador is a good example of the tension and instability that can develop. There, leftist guerrilla forces have undermined the economic infrastructure in order to spread dissatisfaction and opposition to the democratically elected government. El Salvador also shows, however, that even in a profoundly divided society, democratic institutions can rise above economic or political crisis to meet the challenge with a national consensus.;Other nations in Central America and South America are finding that the consensus building inherent in a democracy offers a firm foundation for responding to economic and other crises. So although economic difficulties test our democratic ideals, I believe that recent events, such as the elections in Brazil, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Colombia, Honduras, and Mexico, show that our democracies will emerge not only secure but stronger. That Brazil has just conducted a landmark election during a period of severe economic problems is a clear indication that democracy can not only be maintained but advanced, even during times of economic difficulty.;U.S. Development Assistance;Q. The United States is trying to reduce its contributions to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, while refusing to increase the lending resources of the International Monetary Fund in the proportion desired by developing nations. In light of these initiatives, what expectations can Third World countries have in relation to U.S. participation in the North-South dialog?;The President. Your initial statement is inaccurate. We support an adequate increase in IMF quotas and a substantial replenishment of the Inter-American Development Bank. Moreover, I am committed to working with leaders of Third World countries to address their real development problems in a pragmatic, concrete manner.;The world community's most important contribution to growth in developing countries is through trade. Last year, the United States alone provided more than $68 billion to the non-OPEC developing world in payment for goods imported from developing countries. That is twice as much as LDC's received in official development assistance from all sources.;We are committed to fostering an international trade system which will continue to provide a powerful engine of growth. For example, in last week's GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) meeting in Geneva, we proposed a round of North-South trade talks that would help increase trade between developed and developing countries.;We recognize, however, that concessional assistance also plays an important role in development, particularly for least developed countries. In a period when concessional financing is scarce, those limited resources should be concentrated on the world's poorest, least credit-worthy countries.;Caribbean Basin Initiative;Q. What concrete results can we now see from the CBI? What are the possibilities that the Congress will not support the initiative fully? If the access to the North American market contemplated as part of the as yet unapproved CBI is not approved soon, would your government be disposed to establish some kind of bilateral arrangement with the Caribbean Basin countries?;The President. The Caribbean Basin Initiative is an integrated program of emergency financial aid, trade preferences, and investment incentives. It will help revitalize the economies of the Caribbean Basin by stimulating greater investment, production, and exports in the region. That will create jobs and give people tangible hopes for a better economic future within stable democratic institutions. As you know, the U.S. Congress in September approved the emergency aid portion of the initiative, and those funds are now being disbursed. The trade and investment portions of the initiative will be considered by the Congress in the next few days. We have been working closely with the leadership in both Houses to see that the full legislative program of the CBI is completed before Christmas.;We will continue to seek a multilateral and regional approach, rather than isolated bilateral arrangements. I strongly believe that the cooperation of other countries-both as donors and as participants in the program—strengthens and increases the effectiveness of any individual country's efforts.;Inter-American Relations;Q. The Falklands/Malvinas Islands conflict damaged relations between the U.S. and Latin America. How can hemispheric unity be achieved, and how will your trip better inter-American relations?;The President. We in the New World are very important to each other. Our mutual dependence—our interdependence—shows up in almost every statistic concerning hemispheric trade, capital flows, communications, and other forms of human interaction.;Much of the world's growth potential is here in our hemisphere. I know public attention is focused on alleviating the global recession, that is only natural. But we must focus on how to create the conditions for renewed, long-term growth.;Perhaps the most encouraging trend at work in the hemisphere is the movement toward democracy. We firmly support this trend, and through my trip, I hope to make that support clear and widely known.;We must recognize that the inter-American system has served us well. True, it was unable to prevent the tragic outbreak of war earlier this year. But let's not forget that thanks in large measure to the inter-American system, Latin America devotes less than 1.4 percent of its gross national product to military expenditures. What is called for now is not new institutions but a renewed commitment to making the system's emphasis on the rule of law and the peaceful resolution of disputes work better. That calls for political will. The United States is firmly committed to do its part in this endeavor. My visit to your countries will emphasize that commitment.;Latin American Democracies;Q. In recent years, several democracies have been restored in Latin America: Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Honduras. What importance does your government give to these democracies in contrast to military regimes in the hemisphere? What impact do you believe your administration's human rights policy had on these developments?;The President. The United States places great importance on the development of stable democratic institutions in our hemisphere. In addition to the special bond which the shared value of democracy brings to our relationship with another nation, there are certain practical elements in democratic systems which also deepen and strengthen our ties. Democracies tend to be more stable because they represent a broader spectrum of national opinion. Democracies tend to be more peace-loving because they must consult with their citizens regarding major foreign policy questions. Democracies tend to have more policy continuity because of their broad-based support. And lastly, when we deal with a democratic government, we know it speaks for its sovereign people as a whole, not just for an isolated sector.;I believe that U.S. promotion of human rights and support for democracy in the Western Hemisphere reinforce each other. History shows us that the most effective guarantee of human rights lies in the creation and strengthening of open democratic institutions of government.;But we in the United States can only influence, we cannot determine. I believe that the growth of democracy we have seen in recent years shows the power of the democratic idea—from the unity and stability it brings to a nation, to the dignity and legitimacy it bestows on a government.;Cuba;Q. It is evident that Cuba threatens both Central America and the Caribbean. Have you thought of an effective way to eliminate the root of this Cuban subversion?;The President. You are quite right that Cuba, by its support for armed violence and subversion against its neighbors, is indeed a threat to the peace of the Americas. But more importantly, with its economy in a shambles, with tens of thousands of mercenaries in Africa, and with its extreme dependence on Soviet largesse merely to hold its head above water, Cuba has become more and more a Soviet satellite and a willing conduit for advancing aggressive communism. Were it not for the Soviet Union, which gives massive aid in the form of arms and money—$3 to $4 billion this year alone—Cuba could not afford to do what it is doing.;Our response has been threefold. First and foremost, we are working with the other States of the region to help the actual and potential victims of Soviet-abetted, Cuban-inspired attacks in the region. This includes as its most important element help to strengthen their economies through bilateral and multilateral programs, including the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which is key to the success of this joint effort. Where necessary, we also provide security assistance. Second, we hold the Soviet Union ultimately responsible for much of its client's behavior. And third, we maintain and have strengthened economic measures designed to increase greatly the costs to Cuba and its Soviet paymasters of their interventions in other countries.;Arms Reduction and Deterrence;Q. In the past, the United States permitted the Soviet Union to achieve strategic parity. You now appear to believe that only an American threat to regain superiority will cause the Kremlin to accept your plan to mutually reduce nuclear arms. However, this position has not produced results at the negotiating table. In fact, it appears to be exacerbating the arms race, with the resulting waste by the superpowers of resources that would be better utilized in the fight for development. In light of the change of guard in the Kremlin, isn't this the moment to revitalize detente and abandon the rhetoric of confrontation?;The President. The United States is not seeking strategic superiority. I am convinced that the preservation of peace requires that we follow two parallel paths-deterrence and seeking significant arms reductions to equal and verifiable levels. These are the only paths that offer any real hope for enduring peace. I want to stress that the present disparity in forces brought about by the massive Soviet buildup of the 1970's has been very detrimental to international peace and stability.;I believe our strategy for peace will succeed. Although the United States has always led the effort for arms limitations and reductions, never before have we proposed such a comprehensive program of nuclear arms control. What we are saying to the Soviet Union is this: We will modernize our military in order to keep the balance for peace, but wouldn't it be better if we both simply reduced our arsenals to a much lower level?;We have stressed from the outset that we want a constructive relationship with the Soviet Union, based on mutual restraint, responsibility, and reciprocity. Unfortunately, Soviet-backed aggression in recent years-such as Afghanistan, Poland, and Kampuchea-has violated these principles. But we remain ready to respond positively to constructive Soviet actions.;Brazilian Economy;Q. Brazil is experiencing the gravest economic and financial crisis of the last 20 years. Naturally, Brazil looks to the United States, the richest nation in the world, for support. What types of specific assistance can your administration provide Brazil directly, in the terms of credit and loans, and indirectly, in its attempts to restore the confidence of private banks in the country and to increase the resources of multilateral lending institutions?;The President. The United States continues to be a strong supporter and the largest contributor to the World Bank (IBRD), the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). We believe these institutions have key roles to fill in today's world and provide important resources, both financial and technical. While we believe IMF resources are sufficient to handle current problems, we are working with other members of the IMF to ensure that adequate resources will also be available in the future. We hope that agreement on a new quota increase will come soon and that our suggestion for a special borrowing facility to meet possible extraordinary demands will be accepted.;Brazil can be proud of its well-established reputation for meeting its obligations in a responsible manner and for facing problems with skill, energy, and pragmatism. We have every reason to believe Brazil will continue to take whatever measures it finds necessary to deal with its problems, including any economic adjustments that may be needed to assure sound growth and development. This, in turn, gives lenders confidence in Brazil's creditworthiness—confidence that I share. We believe Brazil will have adequate access to private international financial markets.;U.S.-Brazilian Relations;Q. Brazil condemns foreign interference in Central America, sympathizes with Nicaragua (Brazil has given Nicaragua some economic assistance), condemned Zionism as a form of racism in the United Nations, and was the first country to officially recognize Angola in spite of the Soviet and Cuban roles in Angola's independence. Given the self-proclaimed Western inclinations of Brazil, do the fruits of its foreign policy of "non-automatic alliances" surprise you? Is there a risk that Brazil's foreign policy will place both nations on a collision course? During your visit to Brazil will you call for a new alinement between Brazil and the U.S.?;The President. Your question suggests that the foreign policies of Brazil and the United States are in direct conflict. I do not accept that suggestion. In our discussions last May, President Figueiredo and I found that there are many more points of convergence in our foreign policies than there are points of divergence. That is not surprising, since both countries are based on a similar value system and have similar origins and histories and are dedicated to peace, prosperity, freedom, and justice. As for the points of divergence, well, we live in a large and complex world with many difficult problems and situations, and it would be totally unrealistic to expect any two free and independent nations to hold identical views on all of them. You only find that automatic identity of viewpoint within the Soviet bloc, and I certainly would not like to see that replicated anyplace in the world.;In answer to the second part of your question, no, I do not intend to propose a new alinement between Brazil and the United States. I am interested in strengthening the bilateral relationship, in reviewing areas where there have been problems, and in exploring new possibilities for bilateral cooperation. This is important to me, and I think it is important to President Figueiredo—not in the context of a new alinement, but as reaffirmation of the long-standing friendship between Brazil and the United States and our common commitment to the peace and progress of the hemisphere and the world.;Effects of U.S. Economic Policies;Q. President Joao Baptista Figueiredo stated during a recent speech at the United Nations that "The economic policies of the great powers are destroying wealth without replacing it." The American Government, in particular, has been accused of adopting economically repressive policies, ignoring the pernicious effects on the rest of the world. The U.S., according to critics, is exporting recession and unemployment today in the same way that it exported inflation in the past. Was your government somewhat insensitive regarding the negative repercussions of U.S. economic policies abroad?;The President. I know that slow economic growth in the U.S. is having serious impacts on other economies, and I wish we could have avoided this painful transition period for all of us. The continuation of past U.S. economic policies and the continued lack of control over U.S. inflation would have led to disaster not only for the U.S. but for the whole world economy. We are seeing the beginnings of recovery in the U.S.—inflation has fallen dramatically, interest rates also are dropping fast, and there are encouraging signs of investor confidence, for example, in the stock market and in construction. What we are aiming for now is a revival of steady economic growth with price stability. I want to lay the foundations for a long period of U.S. growth not subject to exaggerated ups and downs which have caused so much pain around the world in the past. I think we are on the right road and that the U.S. economy will once again provide a significant stimulus to production and employment around the world.;U.S.-Latin American Relations;Q. President Betancur has said that the United States is treating Latin America as "America's backyard." How do you respond to that?;The President. While there may have been some basis in the past for the concern that the United States did not focus sufficiently on its relations with the hemisphere, I think it is clear that my administration has devoted considerable attention to our hemispheric relations, as evidenced in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which we and Colombia support, and my current trip, which underlines the importance of our hemispheric neighbors for the United States.;Drug Trafficking and Abuse;Q. Beyond doubt, one of the most important problems between Colombia and the U.S. is drug trafficking, and certainly there have been some important advances such as the recent "Operation Swordfish." Nevertheless, for those who are in the know, drug trafficking is produced not only by the sellers but also by the buyers, which in this case are the U.S. citizens themselves. What policies have been instituted to fight against the immense consumption of drugs in your country?;The President. On October 5, I endorsed our new Federal strategy which is designed to mobilize all our forces to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the United States and to prevent drug abuse, especially among our youth. This is a bold, confident plan, which simultaneously attacks organized criminal trafficking in drugs and international production and exporting of illicit narcotics and seeks to reduce demand for drugs.;I have charged two Cabinet-level councils with responsibility for domestic enforcement and international narcotics control and for overseeing health-related drug programs. The South Florida Task Force on Crime made significant inroads on narcotics trafficking, and we have announced plans to create similar task forces in other regions. My staff and interagency teams are coordinating a nationwide prevention effort—with a strong assist from my wife, Nancy—that involves government, health institutions, business, educational institutions, the media, other private sector interests, and importantly, parents and parent groups.;I have described drug abuse as one of the gravest problems facing us internally. We must undertake vigorous policies and programs at home and overseas where the major drugs are produced. In that context, I am pleased to be able to say that we have been cooperating very actively with the Government of Colombia. For several years we have been engaged in cooperative efforts to help improve the enforcement and interdiction efforts within Colombia against cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs. We have seen some good results. We hope in the future that we can work together to expand this cooperation on supply control. Such cooperation, together with progress on the demand side against drug abuse in the U.S., is the only way to effect a permanent improvement in the situation. My administration has committed more than $900 million per year to this effort, the majority of those funds being spent on reducing drug abuse within the United States.;Colombia and the Nonaligned Movement;Q. What is the Reagan administration's reaction to President Betancur's intention to join the nonaligned movement?;The President. Colombia is a sovereign nation with whom we have excellent relations, and it would not be appropriate for me to express an opinion about its relations with others.;Costa Rican Democracy;Q. Many Costa Ricans believe that the present economic and security crises in Costa Rica and the area endanger our democratic system. What is your administration prepared to do to avoid the destruction of Costa Rican democracy?;The President. There are few countries in the region which have a better understanding of the economic and security challenges facing Central America and the Caribbean today than your own. In his speech to the free elections conference in Washington, D.C., President Monge said that in your February 7 elections, the Costa Rican people confirmed their faith in democracy as the means of resolving your country's economic problems. I share that faith in the democratic process, and agree that economic health is key to a secure future for the entire Caribbean Basin.;While congressional approval of the $350 million supplemental appropriations addresses some of the more immediate concerns, I think we must be equally concerned about the medium- and long-term issues addressed by the trade and investment portions of my own government's Caribbean Basin Initiative. This is a major policy priority for my administration, and we are actively working with Congress to enact those remaining parts of the CBI legislation in the congressional session now underway in Washington.;President Monge's leadership in the recent San Jose conference represented both a growing consensus among the democratic countries of the region as to the conditions necessary for peace, and a commitment among us all to find the means for reducing those tensions. During the past year we have seen free elections and orderly changes of government in Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia—all signatories of the San Jose final act. The challenges are real, but so is our commitment to succeed.;President's Meetings With Latin American Leaders;Q. In less than 6 months, President Monge has met with you twice in Washington. Now you will meet with him in San Jose. This level of contact is higher than usual in traditional relations between Costa Rica, and the majority of Latin American countries, and the United States. What is the reason for these close contacts?;The President. We cannot afford to forget that only a few years ago, Costa Rica, long an historic model for democratic government in the hemisphere, was also virtually alone. In just the last year, six of the countries that participated in the recent San Jose conference conducted free elections and witnessed an orderly change of government. Democratic government has taken the initiative in addressing the economic, social, and political challenges facing the region. This will be my third meeting with President Monge, and it reflects both the common values which we bring to the issues and a recognition that the democratic process itself offers a better alternative than the historic and simplistic choices of the extremes of a violent right or a violent left.;U.S. Assistance to Honduras;Q. We know that the North American Congress has passed strict legislation with regard to sending United States troops outside the country, however, the President has the power to send troops for 30 days. In the event of Nicaraguan aggression against Honduras, could our country depend on the concrete assistance of the United States?;The President. The obstacles to peace in Central America stand clearly exposed, as the countries of the region grapple with severe economic challenges, demands for social justice and reform, strains on public services, and violence frequently born out of extremist solutions. Your own country has been in the forefront in having proposed constructive solutions to resolve these tensions.;Economically, we have collaborated on both the immediate and longer term solutions, and I am optimistic that my own administration's Caribbean Basin Initiative will receive congressional action shortly to address the pressing requirements in the trade and investment areas.;Politically, the recent San Jose conference final act reflected your own country's diplomatic initiatives aimed at reducing the likelihood of further military conflict in the region. As one of the eight democratic governments which signed that final act, the United States supports the growing regional consensus on those conditions necessary for peace in the region. As you know, the level of U.S. economic and military assistance to Honduras has risen significantly over the past year in response to our shared concerns in Central America, and I think represents a clear indication of our support for your country's democratic efforts to surmount these problems.;Sugar Quotas for Honduras;Q. Our country, a friend and an ally of the United States, has witnessed with surprise the imposition of sugar quotas. What was the reason that Honduras was given a substantially smaller quota than the quotas of countries that are openly hostile to Washington?;The President. As I have explained before, the drop in world sugar prices and the congressional reaction to this development left us no choice but to impose temporary sugar import quotas to protect our domestic producers. Quota allocation is based on an average of a country's exports to the U.S. from 1975 (the date when the previous U.S. sugar program expired) through 1981, excluding each country's high and low performance years. The Honduran allocation was determined by this nondiscriminatory formula, which we are applying across the board to all countries in accordance with our international trade obligations.</td></tr>

Thank you very much, and thank you, Hector. I appreciate the chance to be with you all here today.;Over the last 2 1/2 years, your president, Hector Barreto, and others in the leadership of the Hispanic Chamber have been a tremendous source of advice and inspiration to me. So let me begin by saying to you, Hector, and to all of you for what you stand and for what you've done, "Muchas gracias." I can't do too much more in your language—[ laughter]—than that.;But without you in the business community, where would we be? It's your decisions, investments, and risk-taking that make our country a miracle of efficiency and the envy of the world.;There's a story, you know, about a fellow whose friend was so successful in business that he was opening up a new branch office. And he decided to send a floral arrangement, some nice flowers there for the grand opening. When he got there, he was shocked to find that the wreath that was delivered bore the inscription, "Rest in peace." [Laughter] He was angry, and on the way home he stopped in at the flower shop to complain. And he was going at it, and the florist said, "Wait a minute. Just look at it this way: Somewhere in the land today a man was buried under a wreath that said, 'Good luck in your new location.'" [Laughter];But you business men and women of Hispanic descent, you stand for much more than efficiency. I feel very much at home with you. There are people in this blessed land who feel that expressions of love for country and family are old-fashioned. They squirm and get uneasy when we talk about pride in neighborhood and work or speak of religious values. There are people like that. But you know something? You won't find them in the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.;To every cynic who says the American dream is dead, I say, "Come to the Hispanic business community, come see how entrepreneurs of Hispanic descent are not just building new corporations, they're building America's future for all of us.;Inspirational examples of individual accomplishment abound. Your own president and my friend, Hector Barreto, has an inspiring story that I wish every schoolchild in America could hear. Twenty-five years ago, as a struggling immigrant, he dug potatoes for 80 cents an hour. Today, he owns a piece of the dream. In fact, he owns several businesses, including a successful tile distribution company.;And then there is Lourdes Miranda, born in Puerto Rico, into a family in which neither parent had a formal education. Yet, with persistence and uncompromising desire for excellence, she went to college and then on to doctoral studies at the University of Madrid. She is now president of a highly successful media consulting firm in Bethesda, Maryland.;There's another story of hard work and triumph about a junior high school dropout named Manuel Caldera, a veteran, who later earned his G.E.D. degree. He went on to be an electronic technician and an engineer. And with money he saved and with help from a minority loan program during the Nixon administration, he started AMEX Systems, a company specializing in the development and manufacture of electronic equipment. And today, his company does more than support his family, his company supports 700 employees and earns some $62 million a year in sales.;These few that I've mentioned and others of you right in this room offer us a vision of progress and hope. You prove that with freedom of enterprise comes values that make America more than a rich country-they make us a good country.;I don't have to tell you that when Hector Barreto is not running his own business, he's overseeing a host of community service projects. If I could find out where he gets his energy, I'd package it and bring it back to Washington. [Laughter];Nor has Lourdes Miranda's success dampened her concern for others. Her company provides specialized training for young Hispanic women. Last year she helped train 40 women to qualify for job opportunities in today's market.;In a fine example of a private sector initiative, Manuel Caldera's company contributes $500 a month to an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico. And each year, he personally gives to Whittier College for scholarships that enable students of Hispanic descent to study science and engineering.;These are not unusual stories. They are, instead examples of a byproduct of freedom that is always present but often unnoticed-respect and concern for others. Business men and women realize that success depends on fulfilling the needs of others and doing it courteously and efficiently. And by doing for others, you are also achieving for yourself.;This system of ours has produced the most material abundance, the greatest freedom, and the most compassionate country in the history of mankind. Our people came here from every corner of the world, from every ethnic background, and every race and religion seeking freedom and opportunity. Our history isn't perfect, but we can be proud of our country. And Americans of Hispanic descent can be particularly proud of the contributions they have made and are making to the well-being of this nation.;Today it's my special honor to present your award to the Hispanic business man and woman of the year. So, if Hector will join me, I'd like to ask—I would like to ask Manuel Caldera, but I can't, his plane was delayed and so, instead, Sergio Banuelos is going to accept in his behalf—and ask Lourdes to stand up here with us and receive these awards.;I have been mispronouncing it, haven't I? Lourdes.;Ms. Miranda. Yes, you have, Mr. President. [Laughter];The President. It's Lourdes. Thank you, Hector. I told you I wasn't too good in your language. [Laughter];Ms. Miranda. You're doing very well. Thank you.;The President. Well, congratulations.;Ms. Miranda. Thank you very much.;The President. You know, maybe I've told this to some of you before, but this whole matter of language difficulties—some years ago when I was Governor, I was speaking in Mexico City. And I sat down to rather unenthusiastic and not very impressive applause, and I was a little embarrassed. Then a gentleman—it was worse when a gentleman followed me and started speaking in Spanish—which I didn't understand—but he was being applauded about every paragraph. So to hide my embarrassment, I started clapping before everyone else and longer than anyone else until our Ambassador leaned over to me and said, "I wouldn't do that if I were you. He's interpreting your speech." [Laughter];But I believe that all of us share a sacred responsibility to maintain the opportunity and the freedom that we've enjoyed and to pass it on to future generations. Our task hasn't been easy. We're just now emerging from an economic crisis so severe that it would have robbed our children of the America that we all know and love.;Three years ago the ominous signs were everywhere. The world seemed to be counting us out, saying America's best days were past. Even our leaders were throwing up their hands, suggesting we were in a malaise, was the word they used, and our problems were unsolvable.;Well, it's taken patience and hard work. Entrenched policies were squeezing the life out of our economy, and basic change was essential. But I'm pleased to report to you today, America has made a new beginning. This great nation is moving forward again, and we're not turning back.;When we got to Washington 2 1/2 years ago inflation was running at double-digit levels and had been doing so for 2 straight years—the worst performance in 60 years. Well, we've knocked that inflation from double digits down to 2.6 percent for the last 19, months, the lowest it has been for 12 months in 16 years. And for all their talk about compassion, those who call themselves liberal gave us a terrible inflation that would have devastated millions had we permitted it to continue. And today, a family of four earning $25,000 has 8600 more in purchasing power than in 1980.;But let me just interject here that there is another figure that has just come out today that I think you should hear. One of the things that I tried to stress in those things we were doing, laying the groundwork for the economic recovery, was that this time we had to do the job right—a solid, sustained, noninflationary recovery that would last. Well, today, this other piece of news is we are on the right track. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the Producer Price Index—Consumer Price Index for 19. months: 2.6—the Producer Price Index of finished goods has risen only 1.4 percent over the last 12 months, and that's the lowest for a 12-month period in 16 years.;We are launched into a solid recovery. Just before I took office, the prime rate hit 21 1/2 percent, and there were loud cries for a quick fix. Well, we didn't heed the hysteria. We followed common sense. Today the prime interest rate stands at 11 percent. There will be slight fluctuations like we experienced this week, but if the Congress acts responsibly with regard to spending, interest rates will come down more.;When we took office, America was suffering from years of wasteful, uncontrolled spending and taxing. Federal spending was growing at a rate of 17 percent. We've cut that increase by 40 percent.;Paying for all that spending had doubled the Federal tax in just 5 years, between 1976 and 1981. Average working people were being taxed at rates that were once reserved for the wealthy, only a short time before. In these last few years, we have cut personal income tax rates by 25 percent, and soon they will be indexed so that the Federal Government will never again profit from inflation at your expense.;And I don't have to tell you business people about the burden of excessive Federal regulation. Under the direction of Vice President Bush, we have cut 300 million man-hours off the processing of needless red tape and paperwork that was demanded by government.;The cumulative effect of our efforts is just now being felt, and the signs are good. Consumer spending is up. Productivity is up. Industrial production, retail sales, auto sales, housing and construction are all up since the beginning of the year. Last quarter, the economy grew by 8.7 percent, a much bigger jump than any of us had expected or predicted.;One of the last indicators to turn around is unemployment. I feel deeply about the suffering of the unemployed, and don't let anyone tell you differently. I went through looking for a job in the Great Depression of the thirties. Do you think that going back to the policies that dragged our economy down and set fire to inflation will really help the unemployed? Or would you agree that the best way to help all Americans is to continue the reforms that have brought down inflation, interest rates, taxes, and that last month gave us the biggest monthly drop in unemployment in almost 24 years?;In these 2 1/2 years, we have fundamentally changed the direction of government in America. We were headed toward ever-increasing government control, toward a society where power and decisions would be controlled not by you the people, but by a faceless central authority. Permit me to ask you one more question. Is that the America you want to live in and leave to your children? Or do we want to live in a society where all people have the right to make decisions for themselves?;Here again, the Hispanic Chamber is playing a significant role. You have provided a valuable resource to your community, bridging the gap between major corporations and government, making certain that your enterprises and business people have the technical assistance and the contracts they need to compete. In only 5 years, the number of Hispanic-owned firms has jumped 65 percent to some 363,000 businesses, generating about $18 billion in sales per year.;My administration remains firm in its commitment to expanding minority-owned business. And through the strong efforts of the Small Business Administration, which has as its Deputy Administrator, Eddie Herrera, and through our commitment to minority procurement, we've put our money where our mouth is.;Let me answer some of the criticisms that are being hoisted and thrown around, and let's make one thing plain. Our goal isn't welfare or handouts, it's jobs and opportunity. [Applause];Thank you very much. You have just sent a message to some people that need to hear it in Washington, D.C.;If we can prevent our country from being drawn back to the policies of tax, spend, and inflate—policies that knocked the wind out of our economy in the first place—we'll be on our way to a new era of growth and expansion that will better the life of every American. With the energy and enthusiasm I sense in this room, I predict Americans of Hispanic descent will be leading the way. Let us join together today to accept a great challenge. And the challenge is to double the number of businesses owned by Americans of Hispanic descent and to do it in the next 4 years.;What we are struggling to build, however, is much more than a society of wealth. You need only to look around the world to see the relationship between economic freedom and political and social freedom. Nations with government-controlled economies usually have government-controlled speech, religion, and press, as well. Some of you here know that from personal experience.;And of course, some people believe that governments should dominate human action and that individuals must live like sheep. Such people don't believe in the political and social freedoms that we hold dear. They are contemptuous of the worship of God. That philosophy is alien to this hemisphere and has brought deprivation and tyranny wherever it's gained a foothold.;No better example exists than Cuba. Under Castro's rule, Cuba has become the economic basket case of the hemisphere. The Cuban Government sells its young men as Soviet cannon fodder in exchange for a massive subsidy without which it couldn't survive. The Cuban people have been betrayed. They have neither freedom nor material goods. The only things abundant there today are slogans, weapons, repression, and shortages. Food and the necessities of life are severely rationed.;You know, I have to interrupt and tell you something, 'cause I just heard a little joke that I think some people in Cuba are telling. [Laughter] Castro was making a speech to a large audience, and he said, "They say that I am—accuse me of intervening in Angola." And a man going through the audience said, "Peanuts, popcorn? He said, "They say that I'm intervening in Mozambique," and the same voice said, "Peanuts and popcorn!" And he said, "They say I'm intervening in Nicaragua." "Peanuts and popcorn!" And by this time he's boiling mad, and he said, "Bring that man who's shouting 'peanuts and popcorn' to me, and I'm going to kick him all the way to Miami." [Laughter] And everybody in the audience started shouting, "Peanuts and popcorn!" [Laughter and applause] Thank you.;Cuba's repression and economic failure, seriously, are consistent with what has happened in every Communist country. Jamaica flirted with radical socialism, and it turned a tranquil, peace-loving country with great economic potential into a bitterly divided, impoverished society. It's a tribute to the freedom-loving Jamaicans that they withstood the totalitarian temptation and are now rebuilding their country's prosperity with the tools of freedom and democracy.;Today, our nation is confronted with a challenge of supreme importance. A faraway totalitarian power has set its sights on our friends and neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean. If we don't meet our responsibilities there, we'll pay dearly for it.;The security aspect of this challenge must be addressed. Those who suggest otherwise are courting disaster. So, we're helping our friends to defend themselves, and we will continue to help them, showing them we'll stand by them in their hour of need.;But let's get one thing straight. Those who claim our support is only of a military nature are building a huge strawman. Security assistance is not the essence of our approach to Central America and the Caribbean. I don't know how many times it must be repeated before the message gets through: Three out of every four dollars we send to the region are in the form of economic aid. From the early days of this administration, we've been promoting democracy, dialog, and economic progress in Central America and the Caribbean.;When I got to Washington, one of the first heads of state to visit the White House was Jamaica's Prime Minister Seaga. He was anxious to build his economy and, together, we worked out a program to encourage private sector investment. By turning his country away from socialism, Prime Minister Seaga has ended 7 years of economic decline that plagued his people. One hundred sixty-two new investments have been made to date, providing the potential for thousands of new jobs.;Our Caribbean Basin Initiative is designed to bring the power of private enterprise-America's most potent weapon—to help build Central America and the Caribbean. I was finally able to sign this important legislation just 1 week ago, after too long a wait.;As far as I'm concerned, too much politics has been played with what should be our role in Central America. When it comes to keeping our country safe, there must be no Republicans, no Democrats, just Americans. [Applause];Thank you.;Our AID [Agency for International Development] program continues to do some great work in developing the potential of the region's private sector. In Honduras, a team of private sector experts sent by AID helped that country reorganize its forest management, permitting it to protect its resources while reaping the benefits of valuable timberland. I had the honor of personally handing the report of the task force to President Suazo of Honduras.;In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where swine fever disease threatened their entire pork production, AID helped them eradicate the dreaded disease.;In Jamaica, AID helped finance an aquaculture project that when fully implemented will provide a new cash crop from fish ponds, just as it's providing loans, capital, to numerous small business enterprises in other developing Latin American countries.;In Guatemala, AID teams with scientific know-how showed farmers how to use less fertilizer and still double their crops.;Similar efforts are being made in El Salvador, where AID-financed technical assistance is helping tens of thousands of new landowners under the agrarian reform program to learn how to manage their land and increase their income.;And there in El Salvador, as is true in other countries in the region, the AFL-CIO's American Institute for Free Labor is playing an admirable role, both in assisting the land reform process and in providing guidance in the creation of a free union movement.;I'm also aware of what the Hispanic Chamber is doing to strengthen our ties with your business counterparts to the South. I applaud you for your international trade conference, held in Guadalajara, and the initiative that you are demonstrating in the Western Hemispheric Congress of Latin Chambers of Commerce and Industry.;But much more of this information should be given to the American public. We're in the midst of a long overdue awakening. The time has come when all us in the Americas, in the Western Hemisphere, can and must recognize our common bonds. Most of us are descended from pioneers, people with the courage to leave the familiar and start again in a new world. We came here in search of a dream, looking for freedom and a better life. We worship the same God. From the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the north slopes of Alaska, we are all Americans, a new breed of people.;And what a mighty force we can be for good if we work together and use our combined potential. There have been mistakes made in the past, but we can overcome those mistakes because what binds us together is far stronger than what divides us.;I have a vision of a united hemisphere, united not by the arbitrary bonds of state but by the voluntary bonds of free ideals. Today you, our citizens of Hispanic descent, can be a bridge to our neighbors in the south. We have much to do together as Americans and as citizens of the hemisphere. And with God's help, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish.;Thank you for having me with you, and vaya con Dios [God be with you].</td></tr>

Designation will entitle the products of said countries, except for products excluded statutorily, to duty-free treatment for a period beginning on January 1, 1984 and ending on September 30, 1995. As beneficiaries, these eleven also have the opportunity to become eligible for the convention expense tax deduction under Section 274(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by entering into an exchange of information agreement with the United States on tax matters.;Designation is an important step for these countries in their battle to revitalize and rebuild their weakened economies. Designation is also significant because it is further tangible evidence of the constructive cooperation between the United States and the peoples and governments of the Caribbean Basin.;My decision to designate the group of eleven flows out of discussions held between this Administration and potential beneficiary countries and entities regarding the designation criteria set forth in Section 212 of the CBERA. Our discussions with the eleven began rapidly and were concluded last month. However, active and constructive discussions are underway with other potential beneficiaries, and I hope to designate a number of additional countries in the near future.;The eleven countries have demonstrated to my satisfaction that their laws, practices and policies are in conformity with the designation criteria of the CBERA. The governments of these countries and entities have communicated on these matters by letter with Secretary of State Shultz and Ambassador Brock and in so doing have indicated their desire to be designated as beneficiaries (copies of the letters are attached). On the basis of the statements and assurances in these letters, and taking into account information developed by United States Embassies and through other sources, I have concluded that the objectives of the Administration and the Congress with respect to the statutory designation criteria of the CBERA have been met.;I am mindful that under Section 213(B)(2) of the CBERA, I retain the authority to suspend or withdraw CBERA benefits from any designated beneficiary country if a beneficiary's laws, policies or practices are no longer in conformity with the designation criteria. The United States will keep abreast of developments in the beneficiary countries and entities which are pertinent to the designation criteria.;This Administration looks forward to working closely with its fellow governments in the Caribbean Basin and with the private sectors of the United States and the Basin countries to ensure that the wide-ranging opportunities opened by the CBERA are fully utilized.;Sincerely;RONALD REAGAN</td></tr>

And of course I realize, now, that I, in addition to everything else, will be held responsible for the cross-town traffic in New York. [Laughter];Americans are always thrilled to come to this city, and believe me, for a midwesterner from a small town in Illinois, the sidewalks of New York still evoke that sense of romance and excitement that is unique to this city and this State.;Now, whether it's that towering lady out there in the harbor, or the memory of your first Catholic Governor, Al Smith, New York City and New York State symbolize America—its togetherness, its openness, its opportunity, its hope.;And like so many other Americans, I was thrilled a few weeks ago by the sights at Archbishop O'Connor's installation at St. Patrick's Cathedral—the rabbis standing there in the front pews, the Greek Orthodox bishop approaching the altar, St. Thomas Episcopal Church holding hundreds who watched the proceedings on a video screen, and that homily of welcome and humor and love from Archbishop O'Connor.;I've been accused of liking a good story, but I really did love the one the Archbishop told about the second-grader who wrote him and asked if he held down a job before this one. [Laughter] The same young man also wanted to know if the Archbishop had any children. [Laughter] Well, he's spoken to that tonight. I think we're aware that he does—the thousands and thousands of children who are in the schools that bring us to this gathering here tonight.;But who can forget the substance of your new Archbishop's sermon? How many fewer accounts of violence, heartbreak, and tragedy would there be, especially in places like the Mideast, if all the people of the world could take his words to heart? How valid, how meaningful those words are for this season of Lent, this time of reflection and renewal.;Whether or not you are of my religious faith or my moral convictions," Archbishop O'Connor said, "whether you accept the teaching of the Church or reject it on any issue, I see you as sacred persons to be loved, persons of priceless dignity and worth.;Your Excellency, I know how excited you are about your new work here in the Archdiocese of New York, and with a beginning like that, I can't help but think your success here is assured. You have the prayerful best wishes of all of us here tonight and of all America. But, Your Excellency, just one word of advice about living here in New York. Be careful what you say around Mayor Koch— [laughter] —I know I am. [Laughter] I learned this morning he's working on another book. And if the mayor would permit me, I'd like to mention that in the city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Archbishop O'Connor previously served, Mayor James Barrett McNulty, who's no amateur himself, called the Archbishop the "best politician I've ever seen." [Laughter] So, I intend to warn the mayor to be careful, too. [Laughter];But I want, honestly, all of you to know I really was a little nervous about speaking to you here tonight, especially on issues like education. When I look around this room and see the distinguished members of the hierarchy and many prominent educators, not to mention you parents who've given so much time and effort to improving Catholic schools, I have to think of a story that kind of fits the position that I'm in tonight, and particularly having to follow the Archbishop up here at this podium.;There was a fellow who, for very many years, had been quite a celebrity in his end of the country up in Pennsylvania, because he was in great demand as a speaker—he was the last living survivor of the Johnstown flood. And so in telling and retelling his adventures, as I say, he was in great demand. Finally, however, the day came when he passed on to a better life and wasn't in heaven very long before St. Peter told him that newcomers there were expected to sort of bring the others there up-to-date on what was going on. And he said, "Oh, that's great," and he told them about what he'd been doing on Earth.;So he said, "Yes, I'd be very happy to." Well, St. Peter put the group together, and he said, "I'm sure they'll be interested in what you have to say." And then as he introduced him, and as the man stepped toward the lectern, St. Peter just quietly said to him, "That fellow second from the aisle in the front row is named Noah." [Laughter];But actually, the fact that so many of you are activists for education is not a reason for concern, but for pride. Not long ago, opinion polls showed the confidence of average Americans for our governmental institutions had declined to new lows. Many Americans simply believed that government belonged now to politicians and bureaucrats, not to the people. Well, there was a reason for this. After years of listening to the bromides and aphorisms of liberal government, the people felt they'd been had. Federal spending had skyrocketed—it tripled in the seventies-and taxation doubled between 1976 and 1981. Yet far from solving anything, all this government only made our problems worse. It fueled inflation, it drained energy and wealth from the private sector, it halted economic growth, and it eventually put millions out of work.;But at the root of this spend-and-spend, and tax-and-tax, and borrow-and-borrow philosophy was the belief that solving our social problems was simply a matter of allocating resources rather than exerting moral leadership. There were those who thought, and still do, that by changing man's material environment we could perfect human nature and usher in a brave new world. So they favored gigantic government programs and social engineering schemes run by a tiny elite of experts. And that's why they frequently saw traditional values like family, work, neighborhood, religion, as obstacles. In their view, the solutions to America's problems were no longer in her homes, her churches, her schools, or her work places, but in a bureaucrat's budget and a social worker's files.;Much of this was well intentioned. In fact, a book about what liberalism did to even this great city of New York was called just that: "The Cost of Good Intentions." Well today, under the courageous leadership of Mayor Koch, New Yorkers have brought their city back from bankruptcy and disorder. I think you can be proud of that, and you can be proud of your mayor. I bet he wishes now he was here. [Laughter];But on the national level, the fight goes on. One example is the question of tuition tax credits. As you know, we've submitted a bill to the Congress that would make such credits available to parents like yourselves. And the bill that we proposed does not violate the separation of church and state. And it's certainly no threat to public education. What it would do is give hard-working Catholic and other private school parents a break, while increasing diversity and excellence in both public and private schools. And I want to compliment you on your efforts in the past for this bill and pledge again my strongest efforts on its behalf.;I quoted from a Scottish ballad when we were defeated on that. The ballad goes, "I am wounded, but I am not slain. I will rest a bit and fight again." Together, we can uphold and reinforce the basic right of all parents to educate their children in the way that best meets their children's needs.;But opposition to tuition tax credits isn't the only roadblock those in Washington have put in our way. They also managed during the past generation to construct a tax system that excessively burdens the family and actually discriminates against those traditional family values. For example, the dependency exemption on your income tax—the money you can deduct for raising a child or caring for an elderly relative-was $600 in the late forties. That has been increased to $1,000 now. But if that deduction had been indexed to keep pace with inflation, today you would be deducting more than $3,000 for every one of your children. So, you can see that in the very time that the cost of raising a family has gone up, the tax treatment of families has actually worsened. Is it any wonder that American parents feel so much financial pressure today and that such pressure sometimes contributes to family breakups?;I want you to know I've told the Treasury Department to come up with recommendations to make your taxes more simple, fair for families and for all Americans, and to increase incentives for economic growth by broadening the base and bringing your income tax rates down, not up.;On this issue of tax fairness for families, or other issues like the prayer amendment, stricter laws against the criminals that prey on our young people, greater discipline in our schools, and our pro-life amendment, there is more at stake here than just one administration's political agenda. Our goal is to make this nation's traditional values a reality in our daily life.;When I visited His Holiness Pope John Paul II in Rome—and I'm pleased to say I will have the privilege of visiting with him soon again when our paths cross in Alaska-he spoke about the importance of these values. He said it was his profound hope "that the entire structure of American life will rest ever more securely on the strong foundation of moral and spiritual values. Without the fostering and defense of these values," he said, "all human advancement is stunted and the dignity of the human person is endangered.;Respect for the dignity of life, concern for our fellow man, extraordinary acts of charity and mercy—this is our heritage as Americans. And how profoundly this heritage has been enriched by the Catholic experience here in New York.;There are so many examples that come to mind. In my State of the Union Message I mentioned a man known to many of you, the guardian of homeless youth in Times Square, Father Bruce Ritter, who has saved so many young, formerly lost lives at Covenant House. I know that Father Ritter and all who want to see stronger efforts to combat child abduction and child exploitation will be pleased to learn some good news: Within a week, the Justice Department will sign a $3.3 million grant to create the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This Center will help educate parents to prevent abductions and runaways, assist parents whose children are missing, and give technical assistance to local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to find missing children. Let's win these children back.;Or, I wonder how many of you remember the daughter of one of America's most famous novelists, a young woman who came from New England to New York before the turn of the century? Her beauty, her own literary skill, and that of her husband's, made the young couple the toast of society here. But with the death of an infant son and the unavoidable breakup of her marriage, tragedy struck. The young woman, a convert to Catholicism, sought again the meaning and purpose of life, and somehow she found herself on Cherry Street in lower Manhattan. And from that little dilapidated house in New York's slums grew a nursing order of Dominican nuns with hospitals throughout the United States. For cancer patients, shunned in those days like the lepers of another age, the odyssey of Nathaniel Hawthorne's beautiful daughter, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, would become a blessing beyond all description. Hundreds, then thousands, would find treatment and solace and hope, and they were welcome whether they could afford it or not.;The work of Mother Alphonsa of the Hawthorne Dominican s goes on today in two hospitals here in this State and five other hospitals in other States. It's a perfect example of how "sorrow built a bridge into the infinite," of how generous and giving have been the hearts of New York Catholics. It's been a tradition carried right up until our own time. Rarely has the world seen a more magnificent display of the cardinal virtues of faith, hope, and charity than in the manner in which your own beloved Terence Cardinal Cooke met death last year. It was a fitting and inspiring climax to a life of holiness and service to others.;And tonight, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to present posthumously the Nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom, to Terence Cardinal Cooke. Accepting the medal for Cardinal Cooke will be Archbishop O'Connor.;Thank you for having me as your guest tonight. I know of no better way to close than by reading this inscription.;[At this point, the President read the citation which accompanied the medal. The text of the citation follows:];A saintly man and a great spiritual leader, Terence Cardinal Cooke inspired his countrymen with his dedication to his Church, devotion to his flock, and service to his country. As the Military Vicar to our Nation's Armed Forces, Cardinal Cooke worked tirelessly on behalf of those who serve their country in uniform. As a patriot and national leader, he preached the love of country and championed the cause of human freedom. He will live in the memory of his countrymen as a man of compassion, courage, and personal holiness.</td></tr>

President and Mrs. Jorge Blanco, it's indeed an honor for me to welcome you, the first President of your country to make a state visit to the United States. This is a special visit. The people of our countries are both friends and neighbors, and we're pleased to have this opportunity to express our good will to neighbors who reflect the same love of liberty in which we take such pride.;The Dominican Republic today shines as a beacon of freedom-loving people everywhere. Your people have shown the spirit, courage, and perseverance necessary to build, in your words, "a true functional democracy in the Caribbean." Democracy, as all free people have found, is not the easiest path, but it is the best one. It is the way most consistent with the spirit of the New World, with the values of which all Americans from one end of the hemisphere to the other can claim as their birthright.;As such, it is fitting that the Dominican Republic, with its stability and political liberty, now shows others the way. Your nation, after all, was the beachhead of Western civilization in the New World. Christopher Columbus, the great discoverer, landed on your shores during his first Voyage of exploration. In your country still stands the first cathedral of America, built in 1540. The hopes and dreams of all the Americans once focused on those hardy souls who left the Old World and entered the New through the doorway of Santo Domingo.;Today, as you strive to increase the opportunity of all your citizens, you follow in the spirit of those who came before you. You face many challenges in invigorating your economy and improving the standard of living of your people. Yet even in the days of Columbus, the magnificent beauty and vast potential of your land were evident. In early 1493 Columbus wrote, "In that island... we named Espanola, there are mountains of very great size and beauty, vast plains, groves, and very fruitful fields.... The convenience and excellence of the harbors is this island and the abundance of the rivers... surpass anything that would be believed by one who had not seen it." Well, that beauty and that potential still remain. Coupled now with freedom, your people have every reason to expect that great things can be accomplished.;President Jorge Blanco, it is propitious that your visit coincides with Pan American Week, a time when we have for the last 53 years celebrated the ties between the peoples of the Western Hemisphere. The people of the United States place great value on the special ties that we have with friends close to home. And while the progress of any country depends most heavily on the freedom, the hard work, and ingenuity of its own people and government, the United States is committed to healthy cooperation with our Caribbean Basin neighbors for the betterment of all our peoples.;Combined with your own domestic reforms, which we heartily applaud, the trade and commerce unleashed by the Caribbean Basin Initiative should bring vast new opportunities to Dominican s and to other Caribbean people. Your country and some two dozen others will now have for most of your products virtually unrestricted duty-free entry until 1996 into the world's largest market. Never before has the United States or any other nation offered one-way free trade to any regional group of countries. It's a revolutionary step based on the conviction that enterprise, investment, and job creation will elevate the quality of life while preserving the freedom and independence so cherished by both our peoples.;There is a Caribbean country on a much different path. Instead of economic freedom, it imposes heavy-handed controls, denying for people, for example, the right of private ownership and the right to organize independent unions. Instead of seeking mutual respect and friendly commerce with its neighbors, it exports violence and hatred. Instead of enjoying democratic liberties as are guaranteed in the Dominican Republic and most other Caribbean countries, its people are denied freedom of the press, speech, and religion. This tyranny has brought little hope for economic progress, providing its people only shortages and foodlines. Cuba is now dependent on a faraway totalitarian power without whose subsidy its dictatorial government could not export aggression or, indeed, survive.;Such serfdom and bowing to the interests of faraway masters is not consistent with the legacy of the people of this hemisphere. Our history is that of breaking away from such tutelage, and in this all Americans have a common vision. Your proud independence and the continuing strength of democracy in the Dominican Republic is a tremendous inspiration here and to other people in the hemisphere who are now battling to establish their own democracies.;President Jorge Blanco, we in the United States are fully aware that the success of democratic institutions in your country is due to the good will and strenuous efforts of individuals like yourself. You and your fellow countrymen have our respect. As we work to build a more prosperous and happy future, let us continue to open the doors of commerce and social interaction between our peoples.;In less than a decade we will be celebrating the 500th anniversary of a history-shattering event—Columbus' first great voyage of discovery. We look forward to commemorating this, one of mankind's greatest leaps, with the free people of the Dominican Republic.;Mr. President, Pedro Henriquez Urena, a renowned literary figure as well as a great Dominican patriot, once wrote, "Words are like empty sacks. One must fill them with true human feeling." Well, I hope today that you can sense the feeling, the warmth, and admiration behind these words of welcome. President and Mrs. Jorge Blanco, we're proud to have you visiting with us.;President Jorge Blanco. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen, my greetings to you, President Reagan, to your distinguished wife, and to the representatives of your government—and greetings, also, to the generous people of the United States.;I am very pleased with this state visit, made at your invitation and which begins at the doorstep of the majestic White House, which represents and symbolizes the prestigious image of the United States all over the world.;Since the Pilgrims arrived on the shores of Massachusetts in search of a safe haven in order to freely exercise their religious and political ideas, through the heroic struggles which culminated in independence and the establishment of the first democracy in the Americas, and then on to the emancipation of the slaves proclaimed by the eminent Abraham Lincoln, your people have been and are a model for men who join together in support of the eternal ideals of human freedom and dignity. These common efforts have created the great melting pot of races and cultures which is the United States of America.;As President and as jurist, I must recall with admiration the important documents which sustain the institutional history of the great American people, and which have established landmarks in the upward climb of humanity—the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, the Proclamation of the Four Freedoms by Roosevelt, among many others, have been and shall always be the most outstanding example of this nation's contributions to equality, democracy, and social progress.;We represent a Dominican democracy which is nourished, among other sources, by the old teachings which came precisely from this great nation when it proclaimed its independence on the 4th of July of 1776. Since that time, freedom has had its most immediate origin on these American lands.;In the Dominican Republic, we have always fought for freedom, and our recent history increasingly has enhanced this struggle, which is the mainstay of our democracy, playing a vital role within the inter-American system, whose principles have been incorporated into the fundamental charter of our Organization of American States.;I am particularly grateful, Mr. President, for the reference you made to my political role of responsibility for the destinies of my country, and of the difficult task that I face in strengthening our democracy, while at the same time facing the dire effects of an international economic crisis which has dealt harsh blows to the weak economies and fragile political institutions of developing countries. And I want to express my appreciation for the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has opened new possibilities for the development of our countries in the Caribbean.;We are pleased with the certainty that our efforts will always receive the encouragement and cooperation of friendly peoples, particularly the people of this great nation which never falters in its resolve to provide necessary and important solidarity.;I accept your words of praise towards me as a recognition of the values of the Dominican people, firmly resolved to enrich its political democracy with economic and social development and to strengthen peace throughout the hemisphere. I hope that our visit will serve to strengthen even more the firm bonds of friendship and of mutual cooperation between our governments and between our peoples.;And now I would hope that our visit will be able to provide us, a visit which we are making at your kind invitation, with a way to increase even more the very strong bonds of friendship that exist between your people and mine.;Thank you very much, Mr. President.</td></tr>

This morning at the welcoming ceremony, I mentioned the great accomplishments of your people. And, Mr. President, you can be rightfully proud of your country's freedom.;Eugenio Maria de Aostos, a writer from the last century, truly a man of the hemisphere, once wrote, "No one knows better the meaning of justice and freedom than those who have lived under despotism." Well, such is the case of those who lead the Dominican Republic today. In our lifetime, through your efforts and those of good people like you, the Dominican Republic has been rescued from tyranny and brought safely into the family of free nations. Your personal commitment to the high ideals of liberty, Mr. President, is exemplary.;There can be no greater vocation for any statesman than to lead his people to a more free, just, and humane society. In pursuit of that vocation, you have set a standard of statesmanship and patriotism which is a model not only for the Caribbean but for the Western Hemisphere—indeed, for the leader of any country seeking to create a climate of dignity and freedom in which the human spirit can flourish.;This is not to suggest that under a free government there are no problems. One of the perplexing difficulties, as we're both fully aware, Mr. President, is ensuring economic growth and progress. World events totally beyond our control can dramatically change the rules of the game. Such was the case with energy costs during the last decade. Maintaining healthy economic growth in the face of rising energy costs has been a major challenge to democratic governments throughout the world. Progress can no longer be taken for granted, but, instead, requires constant diligence and a commitment to the long-run well-being of a country.;Yet there's no reason that, working together, free people cannot triumph over adversity today just as we have in the past. Juan Pablo Duarte, the great Dominican patriot, said it well: "Let us work for the country," he wrote, "for in so doing we work for Ourselves and for our children.;President Blanco, your government is today ensuring a better tomorrow. You're meeting the challenge head on, working diligently to rebuild your economy through fiscal responsibility and courageous reform in public administration. You've improved your country's business and investment climate. And by stressing the importance of the private sector, and by providing practical incentives for investment, you've made certain the Dominican Republic will be part of the economic upsurge now taking place in the United States, as it spreads throughout the global economy.;Some of you may not be aware that President Blanco, in his country, has established enterprise zones to encourage investment and commerce. Mr. President, perhaps you've got some tips on how to get great ideas like that— [laughter] —through the legislative process here in Washington. Seriously, though, Mr. President, the strength of Dominican democracy have not gone unnoticed by our Congress. Your support and the example of a strong Dominican democracy deserve credit for helping assure the passage of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. You proved that there is a better way, and it works.;Together we can show the world that, indeed, freedom works. Together—well, it's up to us. President Jorge Blanco, we honor you tonight for the part that you and your country are playing in the cause of human freedom.;Now, if you will all join me in a toast to President and Mrs. Jorge Blanco, and to the Dominican Republic. President Jorge Blanco. President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, ladies and gentlemen;This dinner will be permanently engraved in my memory, as it will be in that of my wife and of the members of our delegation. Henceforth, we can include it among the most stellar moments of our lives.;Over and above protocol, we feel the warmth and affection of President Reagan, his gracious wife, Nancy, and the high officials of this nation who receive us as emissaries of the democracy which we represent with genuine pride.;We are pleased to see once again that the Dominican democracy is respected and admired by the great democracy of the United States of America. We are both associated with and agree upon the defense of the human values which gave birth to our respective nations. We share a common past of ideals and principles, and a present full of responsibilities which must contribute to the building of a more promising future for our people.;I appreciate your recognition of the democratic vocation of our people and of the firm resolve of the government we are fortunate to head to fight tenaciously, with unswerving faith and will, for maintenance of a democratic system, in spite of the adversities of an unprecedented world economic crisis which affects all of the international community, but more so the developing countries.;From the very moment I took office I set a clear and precise target: to restore the economy and the finances of the Dominican nation to health. We are devoting major efforts and sacrifices to this unpostponable objective, conscious of the fact that a house in order and the adoption of policies that are conducive to sustained development and of reform measures that will ensure a true system of social justice, are indispensable prerequisites for the strengthening and full effectiveness of our democratic institutions.;The Presidency of a country, be it large or small, is a forge where leadership is hammered out, in the awareness of the resources and aspirations of their peoples. That is why we do not hesitate to support and defend the generous program of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has already become reality and serves as a means to expand our markets, at the same time that it constitutes a great stimulus for private enterprise, a constant and necessary engine for the development of our societies.;I sincerely hope that our talks will lead to appropriate and fair solutions to common problems and will guarantee positive achievements for the development of our economies and the prosperity of our nations.;[At this point, President Jorge Blanco departed from the prepared text of his remarks. He then proposed a toast as follows.];Let us drink a toast to the personal good fortune of the President and his distinguished wife. Let us drink a toast to the happiness of our respective peoples.;Interpreter. There was a part of the President's remarks that were improvised, and I'd like to transmit, to those of you who didn't understand, the English—what he said.;President Reagan, I have been deeply moved by your mention of Eugenio Maria de Aostos and Juan Pablo Duarte. Eugenio Maria de Aostos was the teacher par excellence of all successive generations of Dominican s as the years have gone by. Juan Pablo Duarte, together with other two great patriots, was the founder of our modern republic. But the mention of the name of Juan Pablo Duarte here in this room at the White House is an extraordinary recognition of the ideals that have shaped our nation throughout the years, and which led to the independence movement which led, in turn, to our independence declared on the 27th of February of 1844.;Into this beautiful room have come men. They have come to share the warmth with the beautiful ladies who've accompanied them, and with all of their beautiful dresses. And this, undoubtedly, will be an indelible part of the recollection that we have of this evening. But above all, Mr. President, the warm welcome that you have given us, on behalf of the great American democracy of which you are a worthy leader and to which you bring so much prestige, fills every one of the aspirations that we might have had when we came to this city. And the fruitful results of our conversations will be the golden touch that will accompany us upon our return to our country.;Thank you.</td></tr>

You may have heard that I will be speaking to the American people tomorrow evening on the very subject that you are discussing here, our responsibilities in this hemisphere. As members of the Council of the Americas, you've fostered cooperation and understanding between the United States and our neighbors in the south.;Having been Governor of California, I've long been aware of the rich Hispanic heritage of our country. The Hispanic heritage that we appreciate so much in our Southwestern States reflects not just our traditions but on the many things which all the peoples of this hemisphere share.;Simon Bolivar, the Great Liberator, saw this natural bond between all Americans. Early in the last century, he said of us, "We are a special kind of human being. We have a world apart." Well, building the ties between our people and the 380 million people in the 33 countries of Latin America has been of utmost importance to this administration.;Our policies toward Latin America are aimed at achieving three consistent and mutually enforcing goals. First, we seek to encourage the development of democratic political institutions. Second, we want to see all the peoples of the Americas better their standard of living and improve the vitality of their economies. Third, we want to help our friends defend themselves from Soviet bloc and Cuban-sponsored subversion.;Some of the most inspirational heroes of human liberty emerged from the struggles for freedom and independence in Latin America. One of them, Jose Marti, a Cuban patriot who found refuge in the United States from a despotic regime in his native land, once said, "Like bones to the human body, the axle to the wheel, the wing to the bird and the air to the wing, so is liberty the essence of life. Whatever is done without it is imperfect.;Well, that spirit is alive and growing in Latin America today. Right now, of Latin America's 33 countries, 26 with about 90 percent of the region's population, are either democratic or in transition to democracy. A decade ago, less than 40 percent of Latin America's population was so fortunate.;Transition to democracy in Peru, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic has been followed more recently by Honduras and Argentina. All of this should give us tremendous hope for the future. No longer can Communist dictatorship be juxtaposed against rightist dictatorship as the only alternative.;In June of 1982, I was honored to speak before the British Parliament, the living monument to democracy. I proposed that the people of free countries take a more active role in encouraging and aiding in the development of democratic institutions such as political parties and civic groups throughout the world. For many years, we'd been doing something similar to that by helping build democratic trade unions. Well, with congressional enactment of the National Endowment for Democracy, another little noticed yet, nevertheless, giant step forward has been made. The National Endowment is now working to strengthen democratic parties, trade unions, business and civic associations, and other democratic institutions.;The times we live in are as challenging and as exciting as any in history. There are people in Latin and Central America who are fighting for their freedom every bit as much as our own forefathers. Last Sunday, this struggle for freedom took the shape of Presidential elections in Ecuador, Panama, and El Salvador.;In El Salvador, unofficial results indicate the winner will be Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat who for more than two decades has been in the forefront of democratic reform and in opposition to the Communist left and the violent right.;We look forward to a cordial and productive working relationship with El Salvador. The fact that the Salvadoran election was held at all rejects the—or reflects, I should say, the dedication to democracy and personal courage of the people of that troubled land.;The Communist guerrillas warned people not to vote, yet the people defied the threat. The guerrillas mined roads, and still many thousands walked miles to mark their ballots. Each one of these people who braved such threats deserves our greatest respect and admiration.;A member of my National Security Council staff, Jackie Tillman, was down there last Sunday. She was accompanying Members of the Congress and others who were there to witness the elections. She met a young 15-year-old poll watcher and asked him—15-year-old—asked him how he felt about the voting, half expecting a typical, nonchalant, adolescent reply. And instead, he pointed to his heart and very quietly said, "I feel this voting right here. Well, this is what my country needs," he said, "to defeat the guerrillas and bring peace." That lad, and the millions of other courageous individuals like him, people who've maintained their dignity and honor in the face of such adversity, are, indeed, heroes of democracy.;The economic challenges faced in the southern half of this hemisphere appear as monumental as those in the political arena. Yet there's reason for hope. For the three decades after the Second World War, substantial economic progress was made in Latin America. Growth rates, in fact, matched those in the industrialized democracies and improved the standard of living of a significant proportion of the population. At the same time, however, a rapid increase in the population strained resources and left many in dire poverty. The leap in energy prices and the onset of global recession in 1979 was felt the world over. Few places experienced more pain than Latin America and the Caribbean.;While coping with worldwide economic currents must be the primary responsibility of each country, we're doing what we can to help. We increased by over 50 percent the level of bilateral economic assistance over the previous administration. We've continued to support contributions to the World Bank, the Inter-American Bank, and IMF programs, all of which are vital to Latin America. Discreetly, with much care and consideration for political, social, as well as economic consequences, we worked with leaders in government and the private sector to encourage the refinancing of international debts. And your cooperation has been indispensable in this effort.;And last year, the Congress enacted our Caribbean Basin Initiative, a dramatic and innovative approach to progress in Central America and the Caribbean. By opening up one-way free trade to the United States, the world's biggest market, we're bringing the vast resources of the private sector to play in our efforts to improve the lot of 165 million hemispheric neighbors.;There is no magic or instant solution to the economic woes that plague our neighbors to the south, but we can be confident because in the long run, freedom works. During the last century, a Venezuelan intellectual, Andres Bello, noted that "liberty gives wings to the spirit of enterprise wherever it meets it." Well, I believe that. That's what America—and I mean, when I say "America," from the North Slope of Alaska to the tip of Tierra del Fuego—what it is all about.;Liberty is, of course, something we can't take for granted. One of the greatest challenges faced by this generation of Americans is in Central America today. If we act responsibly, there's no reason we will not meet this challenge.;As you're aware, a bipartisan commission on Central America, headed by Henry Kissinger, came to that conclusion when they reported in mid-January. In Central America today, freedom-loving people, our friends, are under attack by Soviet bloc and Cuban-backed insurgents. We're trying our best to help these courageous and decent people develop their democratic institutions and better their economic lot. But if we do nothing or not enough to help them protect themselves, there will be grim consequences to pay. It's not only their security, it's our security.;If the Communists succeed, if we face a flood of refugees and a direct threat on our own southern border, it will not be because we acted, but because we refused to do what was necessary to avert the crisis. And make no mistake, further Communist inroads in Central America will undermine stability in the entire region and make financial problems far more severe. Together, we can make sure that doesn't happen. I'll be speaking more about that tomorrow night.;What a mighty force for good we, the citizens of all this hemisphere, can be. What a potential we have from pole to pole. And yet one should never expect anything worthwhile to come easy. It'll take all of us working together, acting responsibly, and having the courage to face challenges head-on. But have no worry, in the end we can, with God's help, accomplish great things.;I thank you for letting me be with you today. God bless you, and carry on in what you're doing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c2"><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=36999&st=dominican&st1=" target="blank">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=36999&st=dominican&st1=</a></td><td class="c5">Ronald Reagan: Address to the Nation on the Situation in Nicaragua</td><td class="c6">March 16, 1986</td><td class="c7">My fellow Americans;I must speak to you tonight about a mounting danger in Central America that threatens the security of the United States. This danger will not go away, it will grow worse, much worse, if we fail to take action now. I'm speaking of Nicaragua, a Soviet ally on the American mainland only 2 hours' flying time from our own borders. With over a billion dollars in Soviet-bloc aid, the Communist government of Nicaragua has launched a campaign to subvert and topple its democratic neighbors. Using Nicaragua as a base, the Soviets and Cubans can become the dominant power in the crucial corridor between North and South America. Established there, they will be in a position to threaten the Panama Canal, interdict our vital Caribbean sealanes, and, ultimately, move against Mexico. Should that happen, desperate Latin peoples by the millions would begin fleeing north into the cities of the southern United States or to wherever some hope of freedom remained.;The United States Congress has before it a proposal to help stop this threat. The legislation is an aid package of $100 million for the more than 20,000 freedom fighters struggling to bring democracy to their country and eliminate this Communist menace at its source. But this $100 million is not an additional 100 million. We're not asking for a single dime in new money. We are asking only to be permitted to switch a small part of our present defense budget to the defense of our own southern frontier.;Gathered in Nicaragua already are thousands of Cuban military advisers, contingents of Soviets and East Germans, and all the elements of international terror—from the PLO to Italy's Red Brigades. Why are they there? Because as Colonel Qadhafi has publicly exulted: "Nicaragua means a great thing: it means fighting America near its borders, fighting America at its doorstep.;For our own security, the United States must deny the Soviet Union a beachhead in North America. But let me make one thing plain: I'm not talking about American troops. They are not needed, they have not been requested. The democratic resistance fighting in Nicaragua is only asking America for the supplies and support to save their own country from communism. The question the Congress of the United States will now answer is a simple one: Will we give the Nicaraguan democratic resistance the means to recapture their betrayed revolution, or will we turn our backs and ignore the malignancy in Managua until it spreads and becomes a mortal threat to the entire New World? Will we permit the Soviet Union to put a second Cuba, a second Libya, right on the doorstep of the United States?;How can such a small country pose such a great threat? Well, it is not Nicaragua alone that threatens us, but those using Nicaragua as a privileged sanctuary for their struggle against the United States. Their first target is Nicaragua's neighbors. With an army and militia of 120,000 men, backed by more than 3,000 Cuban military advisers, Nicaragua's Armed Forces are the largest Central America has ever seen. The Nicaraguan military machine is more powerful than all its neighbors combined.;This map—[indicating]—represents much of the Western Hemisphere. Now, let me show you the countries in Central America where weapons supplied by Nicaraguan Communists have been found: Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala. Radicals from Panama to the south have been trained in Nicaragua, but the Sandinista revolutionary reach extends well beyond their immediate neighbors. In South America and the Caribbean, the Nicaraguan Communists have provided support in the form of military training, safe haven, communications, false documents, safe transit, and, sometimes, weapons to radicals from the following countries: Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic. Even that is not all, for there was an old Communist slogan that the Sandinistas have made clear they honor: The road to victory goes through Mexico.;If maps, statistics, and facts aren't persuasive enough, we have the words of the Sandinistas and Soviets themselves. One of the highest level Sandinista leaders was asked by an American magazine whether their Communist revolution will, and I quote, "be exported to El Salvador, then Guatemala, then Honduras, and then Mexico." He responded, "That is one historical prophecy of Ronald Reagan that is absolutely true.;Well, the Soviets have been no less candid. A few years ago, then-Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko noted that Central America was, quote, "boiling like a cauldron" and ripe for revolution. In a Moscow meeting in 1983, Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Ogarkov declared: "Over two decades, there are Nicaragua"—I should say, "there was only Cuba in Latin America. Today there are Nicaragua, Grenada, and a serious battle is going on in El Salvador." But we don't need their quotes, the American forces who liberated Grenada captured thousands of documents that demonstrated Soviet intent to bring Communist revolution home to the Western Hemisphere.;So, we're clear on the intentions of the Sandinistas and those who back them. Let us be equally clear about the nature of their regime. To begin with, the Sandinistas have revoked the civil liberties of the Nicaraguan people, depriving them of any legal right to speak, to publish, to assemble, or to worship freely. Independent newspapers have been shut down. There is no longer any independent labor movement in Nicaragua nor any right to strike. As AFL-CIO leader Lane Kirkland has said, "Nicaragua's headlong rush into the totalitarian camp cannot be denied by anyone who has eyes to see.;Well, like Communist governments everywhere, the Sandinistas have launched assaults against ethnic and religious groups. The capital's only synagogue was desecrated and firebombed—the entire Jewish community forced to flee Nicaragua. Protestant Bible meetings have been broken up by raids, by mob violence, by machineguns. The Catholic Church has been singled out, priests have been expelled from the country, Catholics beaten in the streets after attending mass. The Catholic primate of Nicaragua, Cardinal Obando y Bravo, has put the matter forthrightly. "We want to state clearly," he says, "that this government is totalitarian. We are dealing with an enemy of the Church.;Evangelical pastor Prudencio Baltodano found out he was on a Sandinista hit list when an army patrol asked his name. "You don't know what we do to the evangelical pastors. We don't believe in God," they told him. Pastor Baltodano was tied to a tree, struck in the forehead with a rifle butt, stabbed in the neck with a bayonet, finally, his ears were cut off, and he was left for dead. "See if your God will save you," they mocked. Well, God did have other plans for Pastor Baltodano. He lived to tell the world his story—to tell it, among other places, right here in the White House.;I could go on about this nightmare—the black lists, the secret prisons, the Sandinista-directed mob violence. But as if all this brutality at home were not enough, the Sandinistas are transforming their nation into a safe house, a command post for international terror. The Sandinistas not only sponsor terror in El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras—terror that led last summer to the murder of four U.S. marines in a care in San Salvador—they provide a sanctuary for terror. Italy has charged Nicaragua with harboring their worst terrorists, the Red Brigades.;The Sandinistas have even involved themselves in the international drug trade. I know every American parent concerned about the drug problem will be outraged to learn that top Nicaraguan Government officials are deeply involved in drug trafficking. This picture—[indicating]—secretly taken at a military airfield outside Managua, shows Federico Vaughn, a top aide to one of the nine commandantes who rule Nicaragua, loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics, bound for the United States. No, there seems to be no crime to which the Sandinistas will not stoop, this is an outlaw regime.;If we return for a moment to our map, it becomes clear why having this regime in Central America imperils our vital security interests. Through this crucial part of the Western Hemisphere passes almost half our foreign trade, more than half our imports of crude oil, and a significant portion of the military supplies we would have to send to the NATO alliance in the event of a crisis. These are the chokepoints where the sealanes could be closed. Central America is strategic to our Western alliance, a fact always understood by foreign enemies. In World War II only a few German U-boats, operating from bases 4,000 miles away in Germany and occupied Europe, inflicted crippling losses on U.S. shipping right off our southern coast. Today Warsaw Pact engineers are building a deep water port on Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, similar to the naval base in Cuba for Soviet-built submarines. They are also constructing, outside Managua, the largest military airfield in Central America—similar to those in Cuba, from which Russian Bear Bombers patrol the U.S. east coast from Maine to Florida.;How did this menace to the peace and security of our Latin neighbors, and ultimately ourselves, suddenly emerge? Let me give you a brief history. In 1979 the people of Nicaragua rose up and overthrew a corrupt dictatorship. At first the revolutionary leaders promised free elections and respect for human rights. But among them was an organization called the Sandinistas. Theirs was a Communist organization, and their support of the revolutionary goals was sheer deceit. Quickly and ruthlessly, they took complete control.;Two months after the revolution, the Sandinista leadership met in secret and, in what came to be known as the "72-hour Document," described themselves as the vanguard of a revolution that would sweep Central America, Latin America, and finally, the world. Their true enemy, they declared: the United States. Rather than make this document public, they followed the advice of Fidel Castro, who told them to put on a facade of democracy. While Castro viewed the democratic elements in Nicaragua with contempt, he urged his Nicaraguan friends to keep some of them in their coalition, in minor posts, as window dressing to deceive the West. "And that way," Castro said, "you can have your revolution and the Americans will pay for it." And we did pay for it. More aid flowed to Nicaragua from the United States in the first 18 months under the Sandinistas than from any other country. Only when the mask fell, and the face of totalitarianism became visible to the world, did the aid stop.;Confronted with this emerging threat, early in our administration I went to Congress and with bipartisan support managed to get help for the nations surrounding Nicaragua. Some of you may remember the inspiring scene when the people of El Salvador braved the threats and gunfire of Communist guerrillas, guerrillas directed and supplied from Nicaragua, and went to the polls to vote decisively for democracy. For the Communists in El Salvador, it was a humiliating defeat. But there was another factor the Communists never counted on, a factor that now promises to give freedom a second chance—the freedom fighters of Nicaragua.;You see, when the Sandinistas betrayed the revolution, many who had fought the old Somoza dictatorship literally took to the hills and, like the French Resistance that fought the Nazis, began fighting the Sovietbloc Communists and their Nicaraguan collaborators. These few have now been joined by thousands. With their blood and courage, the freedom fighters of Nicaragua have pinned down the Sandinista army and bought the people of Central America precious time. We Americans owe them a debt of gratitude. In helping to thwart the Sandinistas and their Soviet mentors, the resistance has contributed directly to the security of the United States.;Since its inception in 1982 the democratic resistance has grown dramatically in strength. Today it numbers more than 20,000 volunteers, and more come every day. But now the freedom fighters' supplies are running short, and they are virtually defenseless against the helicopter gunships Moscow has sent to Managua. Now comes the crucial test for the Congress of the United States. Will they provide the assistance the freedom fighters need to deal with Russian tanks and gunships, or will they abandon the democratic resistance to its Communist enemy?;In answering that question, I hope Congress will reflect deeply upon what it is the resistance is fighting against in Nicaragua. Ask yourselves: What in the world are Soviets, East Germans, Bulgarians, North Koreans, Cubans, and terrorists from the PLO and the Red Brigades doing in our hemisphere, camped on our own doorstep? Is that for peace? Why have the Soviets invested $600 million to build Nicaragua into an armed force almost the size of Mexico's, a country 15 times as large and 25 times as populous. Is that for peace? Why did Nicaragua's dictator, Daniel Ortega, go to the Communist Party Congress in Havana and endorse Castro's call for the worldwide triumph of communism? Was that for peace?;Some Members of Congress ask me, why not negotiate? That's a good question, and let me answer it directly. We have sought, and still seek, a negotiated peace and a democratic future in a free Nicaragua. Ten times we have met and tried to reason with the Sandinistas, 10 times we were rebuffed. Last year we endorsed church-mediated negotiations between the regime and the resistance. The Soviets and the Sandinistas responded with a rapid arms buildup of mortars, tanks, artillery, and helicopter gunships.;Clearly, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have grasped the great stakes involved, the strategic importance of Nicaragua. The Soviets have made their decision-to support the Communists. Fidel Castro has made his decision—to support the Communists. Arafat, Qadhafi, and the Ayatollah Khomeini have made their decision—to support the Communists. Now we must make our decision. With Congress' help, we can prevent an outcome deeply injurious to the national security of the United States. If we fail, there will be no evading responsibility-history will hold us accountable. This is not some narrow partisan issue, it is a national security issue, an issue on which we must act not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.;Forty years ago Republicans and Democrats joined together behind the Truman doctrine. It must be our policy, Harry Truman declared, to support peoples struggling to preserve their freedom. Under that doctrine, Congress sent aid to Greece just in time to save that country from the closing grip of a Communist tyranny. We saved freedom in Greece then. And with that same bipartisan spirit, we can save freedom in Nicaragua today. Over the coming days I will continue the dialog with Members of Congress—talking to them, listening to them, hearing out their concerns. Senator Scoop Jackson, who led the fight on Capitol Hill for an awareness of the danger in Central America, said it best: "On matters of national security, the best politics is no politics.;You know, recently one of our most distinguished Americans, Clare Boothe Luce, had this to say about the coming vote: "In considering this crisis," Mrs. Luce said, "my mind goes back to a similar moment in our history—back to the first years after Cuba had fallen to Fidel. One day during those years, I had lunch at the White House with a man I had known since he was a boy, John F. Kennedy. 'Mr. President,' I said, 'no matter how exalted or great a man may be, history will have time to give him no more than one sentence. George Washington, he founded our country. Abraham Lincoln, he freed the slaves and preserved the Union. Winston Churchill, he saved Europe.' 'And what, Clare,' John Kennedy said, 'do you believe my sentence will be?' 'Mr. President,' she answered, 'your sentence will be that you stopped the Communists—or that you did not.;Well, tragically, John Kennedy never had the chance to decide which that would be. Now leaders of our own time must do so. My fellow Americans, you know where I stand. The Soviets and the Sandinistas must not be permitted to crush freedom in Central America and threaten our own security on our own doorstep. Now the Congress must decide where it stands. Mrs. Luce ended by saying: "Only this is certain. Through all time to come, this, the 99th Congress of the United States, will be remembered as that body of men and women that either stopped the Communists before it was too late—or did not.;So, tonight I ask you to do what you've done so often in the past. Get in touch with your Representative and Senators and urge them to vote yes, tell them to help the freedom fighters. Help us prevent a Communist takeover of Central America.;I have only 3 years left to serve my country, 3 years to carry out the responsibilities you entrusted to me, 3 years to work for peace. Could there be any greater tragedy than for us to sit back and permit this cancer to spread, leaving my successor to face far more agonizing decisions in the years ahead? The freedom fighters seek a political solution. They are willing to lay down their arms and negotiate to restore the original goals of the revolution, a democracy in which the people of Nicaragua choose their own government. That is our goal also, but it can only come about if the democratic resistance is able to bring pressure to bear on those who have seized power.;We still have time to do what must be done so history will say of us: We had the vision, the courage, and good sense to come together and act—Republicans and Democrats—when the price was not high and the risks were not great. We left America safe, we left America secure, we left America free—still a beacon of hope to mankind, still a light unto the nations.;Thank you, and God bless you.</td></tr>

Is one ever set for that?;Dominican Republic-U.S. Relations;Q. President Reagan, can we ask you some questions about the relations with the Dominican Republic and the United States? Is there a possibility of getting more help from the United States of America Republic in terms of the sugar war, things like this?;President Reagan. As you know, we've had some problems both ways, with the Congress and matters of that kind, but I can assure you that we feel that the relationship we have with the Dominican Republic is of the best, and we treasure it and hope to continue that close relationship.</td></tr>

It has been my great pleasure to have met with President Balaguer. His remarkable leadership has been an important element in the significant, positive role that the Dominican Republic has played in regional affairs.;President Balaguer has been a driving force throughout his country's democratic development. In 1966 he led democracy's return to the Dominican Republic after years of political uncertainty and turmoil. Indeed, he is, in many ways, the father of Dominican democracy. It's a great honor to have him here. The United States and the Dominican Republic traditionally have enjoyed very close and warm relations. Our meeting today reflected the important historical, cultural, political, and economic ties that bind our two countries. We discussed the economic problems that face us and examined possible solutions.;President Balaguer described the serious impact that low world sugar prices and declining market access are having on the Dominican Republic. I applaud his government's courageous efforts to meet difficult economic and developmental challenges through diversification and private sector investment. The United States Government wants to participate in these processes. Within our budget limitations, we will continue to support development and growth in the Dominican Republic.;Sharing a common hemisphere and democratic beliefs, we examined important political developments elsewhere in the Caribbean and Latin America. We are both concerned by recent events in Central America and Panama. I deeply appreciate President Balaguer's insights into these issues. We both hope for democratic and peaceful solutions to the problems of the region. We want to see an end to the pursuit of military solutions and to the massive Soviet armament that fuels that pursuit. I congratulated the President on his government's role in hosting the first Nicaraguan peace talks mediated by Cardinal Obando y Bravo. We discussed bilateral cooperation in the critical area of narcotics. I want personally to thank President Balaguer for his assistance in combating illegal narcotics in the Caribbean. His government's efforts have been crucial, and we look forward to continued cooperation on this matter of national and hemispheric security.;So, thank you again, Mr. President, for coming to visit me today in Washington. You're a close and good friend of the United States, a leader dedicated to freedom, democracy, and peace, a trusted ally. I wish you well and look forward to working with you as our two countries face the challenges of the future. Thank you, and God bless you.;President Balaguer. Mr. President, this is a beautiful spring day to pay this visit on President Ronald Reagan, which is a great honor to me, but not really to me, but an honor which is really a distinction on my country. I have told President Reagan today of not only my personal admiration but that of the whole people of the Dominican Republic for himself, personally, for his policies as a leader of the world in the defense of human rights, and for the progress of democratic regimes in Latin America and throughout the world.;Together we have reviewed the bilateral problems and issues between our two countries. We have also reviewed the problems affecting other Latin American countries. All these countries have been inspired by President Reagan's policies in the areas of democracy, liberty, and for helping the weak toward economic recovery. The Dominican Republic has received a great deal of help from the Reagan administration, especially in terms of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. This is the most constructive initiative which has ever come to Latin America. It is the most practical initiative and the one from which we have derived the most advantage. And here I include the Good Neighbor Policy of Roosevelt and the Alliance for Progress of President Kennedy, because those were theoretical abstractions, whereas the Caribbean Basin Initiative has been a pragmatic movement which has achieved a great deal of practical good for our countries.;The Dominican Republic specifically has improved its economy, has progressed, has established a large number of free trade zones, opening foreign industries, and thus has reduced its unemployment rate a great deal. Also, the Reagan plan has permitted us to export more to the United States because of the lowering, or total elimination, of tariffs. We have exported more clothes, more apparel, manufactured in the Dominican Republic, as well as other products-which we have now started exporting to the United States, thanks to the lowering of tariff barriers, with once again, the consequence of lowering unemployment.;There are problems which subsist in our relations, especially in connection with the lowering of our sugar quota, but this we have discussed with President Reagan and with his senior advisers in this area of expertise. We also discussed the subject this morning on Capitol Hill with a number of Senators who are friends of the Dominican Republic. We found there a very receptive climate and feel confident that the problem will be solved, taking into account the interests of both of our countries. Our talks today regarding our policies vis-a-vis other countries of the region have been ones in which we have agreed on almost every point. We agreed, for example, on the subject of Haiti and on our discussions of other countries which are our neighbors. And we have almost total and virtual agreement between the two countries.;It is a great pleasure to me now to thank you, President Reagan, very warmly for your hospitality, for your great cordiality and an honor which this visit has done to my country, the Dominican Republic. If when I get home I am asked if I come with my hands full or my hands empty, I will say that my hands are very full—full of friendship, full of affection, and full of admiration for the United States and for its President, Ronald Reagan. My admiration for Ronald Reagan is nothing new. It is something which I have always spoken of, saying that he is not only a leader of his country and of the continent but a world leader—with his revolutionary economic policies, his loyalty to democratic regimes everywhere, and his fight against drug trafficking in the world.;And here I would like just to interject a word of admiration for Mrs. Reagan for Nancy, the First Lady, whose human struggle against drug trafficking stands as an example to women all over the world, especially in Latin America, which is suffering so much from this scourge, telling us all that we all must make our own efforts to eradicate this plague in order to save the youth of this generation and succeeding generations.;Thank you, President Reagan. Believe me, your economic policies leading to the recovery of the American economy are also leading to the recovery of economies throughout the world. You will continue always to be an inspiration and a guide to me. I am always conscious of your struggle to increase the defense of human rights, to reduce unemployment, to solve the social problems of the world—things that we will do together and we will always remember in the Dominican Republic.;Once again, thank you, Mr. President.;Reporter. Mr. President, sir, the Senate wants you to take stronger action against Panama. They voted today. Will you consider that?;President Reagan. We're considering everything, but I can't take any more questions.;Q. What do you want Secretary Shultz to say to the Palestinians, Mr. President?;President Reagan. I can't now.</td></tr>

Well, thank you all for your greeting this morning, and welcome reverend clergy, Nancy, Attorney General Meese, Members of the Congress, diplomats, and members of our Cabinet, and distinguished guests.;Today we're gathered to honor, as you've been told, the brave public servants who have fallen in the war On drugs. These men took a solemn oath to uphold the law. They accepted the dangerous work of defending our communities, our borders, our families from the scourge of narcotics. And in the line of duty, these courageous citizen soldiers paid the ultimate price. Some died close to home in the towns where they were born. Others fell in foreign lands. But they were each lost to us far too soon. And they each made their love for this country and for us, their countrymen, something real that they lived each day.;Today and in days to come, it'll be our turn to show our love for them. We can show our love by teaching our children to just say no to drugs, by teaching them to choose life, by helping them to live in the world God made, not in an artificial, drug-induced world of false hopes and permanent darkness, of imaginary freedom, but absolute slavery. America's liberty was purchased with the blood of heroes. Our release from the bondage of illegal drug use is being won at the same dear price. The battle is ultimately over what America is and what America will be. At our founding, we were promised the pursuit of happiness, not the myth of endless ecstasy from a vial of white poison. We won our personal freedom so that we could serve God and man, so that we could freely produce and create and build a nation of strong families, rich farms, and great cities. We struggled for liberty in order to cherish it and defend it and transmit it undiminished to our children and theirs.;What sort of a nation is America? The kind that produces heroes like Enrique Camarena Salazar, Eddie Byrne, Terry McNett, and many others who gave their lives in the battle against illegal drugs. We're the kind of country that will pull together and sacrifice to rid ourselves of the menace of illegal drug use because we know that drugs are the negation of the type of country we were meant to be.;In New York City, a young rookie cop, Eddie Byrne, was sitting in his patrol car protecting a government witness in a drug case. On February 26th, at 3:30 a.m., Eddie Byrne was shot in the head three times at point-blank range. His father, a retired police lieutenant, said, "If my son, Eddie, sitting in a police car, representing and protecting us, can be wasted by scum, then none of us is safe." Newspaper accounts say he was ordered killed by a drug kingpin in order to send a message to the police.;Enrique Camarena Salazar, special agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, was conducting an undercover investigation in Guadalajara, Mexico, to smash a ring of drug traffickers. He was kidnapped, tortured brutally, and killed.;Terry McNett, a detective in the Sedgwick County, Kansas, sheriff's office, was part of a team raiding the house of an alleged crack dealer in Wichita 2 months ago. After entering the house, Detective McNett, 36 years old, a 15-year police veteran, was shot twice in the right eye and killed.;For these men and for all men and women in this country and around the world who've perished in the war on drugs, I would like to ask that we observe a moment of silence on this solemn occasion. Would you join me? Amen.;We rededicate ourselves to continue their struggle. It's a struggle of which we've all been a part and one in which we've worked together.;The United States is joined by other countries in a common battle against drugs. I've received a report from Attorney General Meese on his recent trip, that he mentioned in his remarks, to the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. And I'm particularly encouraged by the commitment he received from the leaders of those countries to heighten efforts in the crusade against narcotics trafficking. The drug enforcement and justice officials overseas have our full support.;I want to pay special tribute to the many sacrifices made by our international allies in this fight. In Colombia alone, 12 supreme court justices, an attorney general, justice minister, and scores of other judicial and law enforcement officials have lost their lives. The traffickers in Colombia have also extended their terror beyond its borders. In 1987 former justice minister, and then Ambassador to Hungary, Enrique Parejo was shot and nearly killed in Budapest at the direction of traffickers. Fortunately he survived and last week received PRIDE's Spirit of Freedom Award. We have the honor of his presence today and salute his courage. Recently, Colombia's Chief Prosecutor, Attorney General Carlos Hoyos, while fighting his country's war on drugs, was abducted and murdered. Similarly, officials from Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, and other nations have perished in this international struggle. These giants of courage and the brave men and women like them around the world will be remembered in our prayers.;When I spoke to our nation's police chiefs 7 years ago, we pledged a united effort against the menace of illegal drugs. And since then, important progress has been made. Since 1981 the antidrug law enforcement budget has tripled, and another 13 percent increase has been requested. No nonsense Federal judges are part of the war on crime. Drug convictions have more than doubled since 1979, with prison sentences 40 percent longer. And last year new, tougher sentencing guidelines were issued. The Comprehensive Crime Control Act, passed in 1984 after a long effort—passed with the help of Members of the Congress who are here today—they helped put drug dealers out of business by confiscating their assets. Last year over $500 million in ill-gotten assets were seized. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which I signed into law in October, 1986, contributed additional tools to our effort.;Our antidrug effort spans the Federal Government. It is coordinated by the Cabinet-level National Drug Policy Board chaired by Attorney General Meese. The coordination of Federal, State, local, and international drug enforcement is at an all-time high. Under the leadership of the Vice President, our national drug interdiction system has enabled unprecedented levels of narcotics to be seized en route from source countries and at our border by law enforcement agencies. These efforts were significantly assisted by the U.S. military, which last year provided more than 16,000 hours of air surveillance and over 2,500 ship days of maritime support in the war against drugs.;Drug eradication programs are now underway in 23 countries. That's up from just two in 1981. And to stem demand for illegal drugs, more funds than ever before are being spent on drug education and public awareness, and I've requested a further 12-percent increase in that.;We can list the accomplishments in this war, but by themselves these efforts, impressive as they may seem, are still not enough. It'll never be enough until we have fully honored the memory of those who have perished and until we have won for them, and for ourselves, a drug free America.;I'm especially proud of the antidrug work that Nancy has done, which is an act of love beyond anything money can achieve and which has changed the way we talk and think about drugs. You see, we too often forget how the level of drug abuse reached the proportions that it did. Back in the 1960's and 1970's, America crossed a deadly line. The use of illegal drugs became not just condoned but even celebrated by a permissive cultural establishment whose slogan was "Just Say Yes." It was a time when all the restrictions on personal behavior were under attack. Some liberal politicians decried our prohibitions on drugs as conservative, moralistic, reactionary, and old-fashioned-or simply remained silent that there even was a drug problem. Many universities adopted a hands-off attitude toward so*called recreational drug use, and the entertainment industry produced films and music that promoted and legitimized the drug subculture. When our young people looked for guidance and direction, instead of finding positive role models warning them of the dangers of drugs, they would too often see celebrities portraying drug use as cool, hip, and with it. What greater shame can there be? With the active encouragement of the progressive culture, our young people began to use drugs—not to rebel but to fit in.;And tragically, countless thousands of young lives were needlessly destroyed. The truth was that drugs are killers, but for nearly a generation that vital message was ignored by a whole group of people who should have known better. The leaders of that destructive generation remain the forgotten accomplices in the epidemic of illegal drug use, they cannot escape blame when a law enforcement officer dies in the battle.;The good news is that America is on the attack in the fight against drugs. Our young people are turning away from illegal drug use and learning to say, just say no. Almost all of the high school seniors, in the latest annual survey, said that it was wrong to even try a drug like cocaine. And the number using cocaine and marijuana fell significantly. Whole communities are working as never before toward the goal of a drug free America.;USA Today reports that in Philadelphia the police department has trained 25,000 residents to observe, identify, and report drug dealers under its town watch program. In Boise, Idaho, the police work with a group called Parents and Youths Against Drug Abuse to promote drug education. In Jackson, Mississippi, a group of teenagers is fighting back by forming Teens on Patrol to act as the eyes and ears for the local police force. These efforts serve as fitting tributes to the fallen heroes that we honor here today. Our heroes embody the courage and commitment that built America and which will see us through this battle. Let us, through our efforts, keep faith with these men and their sacrifice.;Six months ago, I sent to the Congress a new and important piece of legislation, the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 1987, that would provide a powerful new deterrent to violent crime and narcotics trafficking. This critical legislation takes on the drug syndicates on their own terms. It says that when narcotics racketeers kill and are convicted they will face execution. In 1986 the House of Representatives twice approved this provision, but this year neither the House nor the Senate Judiciary Committees have yet taken up this bill. It is time to back up the rhetoric on the drug problem with action. And I call upon the House and Senate to vote promptly on my bill providing for capital punishment when a death results from drug dealing and when a DEA or other law enforcement officer is murdered. When drug syndicates commit murder, our sympathy should be with the victims, not the killers. It's time for the Congress to pass this bill and make it law. It's time for us to send our own message to people who kill cops.;Our antidrug efforts are working. The heroic sacrifices made by America's law enforcement officers and by public servants from around the world have not been in vain. They have made a difference, a difference that will save lives and assure our children a better future in the type of America they deserve to grow up in. Our dream is a nation of drug free communities, drug free workplaces, drug free homes, and drug free schools. And that is what these men died for, and that is what we must work for.;In the crusade for a drug free America, these heroes gave all that they had and all that they were. Let us do all that we can to honor their memory. Through our prayers, let us be with them. Through our work, let us commemorate their sacrifice. And through our achievement, let us celebrate their lives. Together we can achieve what they died for—a drug free America. Thank you, and God bless you.;Attorney General Meese. Thank you, Mr. President, for those inspiring remarks, which highlight our being here today. In your remarks you mentioned the heroes we are commemorating. Among those are two agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency, one of the key institutions in our struggle against drug abuse. We're pleased to have representing our drug law enforcement organizations, Jack Lawn, the Administrator of DEA, seated here on the dais. Jack has been honored recently by his election as president of the International Drug Enforcement Conference.;We had a tragedy in the DEA recently, when two special agents, Paul Seema and George Montoya, were killed in the course of a heroin investigation near Los Angeles. In that operation, one of their colleagues, special agent Jose Martinez, was wounded. We thank God that he survived, and we're pleased to have him with us today. Surely, no one is a more worthy spokesman for those who risked their lives in the course of the battle against drugs than Mr. Martinez. And so, it is my great honor at this time to ask special agent Martinez to step up and say a few words.;Mr. Martinez. First of all, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all my friends, family, and everyone in the DEA family, and all the other law enforcement officers and community for their support while I was hospitalized, and the general public for their encouragement to me—all the letters I received. And I would also like to thank everyone for the encouragement that was shown to the loved ones of my slain fellow agents, Paul Seema and George Montoya. I am thankful for the greater public concern about drug abuse. And thank you, Mr. President and Mrs. Reagan, for your contributions to this awareness.;Those of us in drug enforcement are committed to the task of removing drugs from our society, knowing and accepting the dangers involved. At the same time, many in society rationalize the drug use as being a victimless crime and not harmful to anyone. Paul Seema and George Montoya were victims of society's demand to satisfy their desire for drugs. Not until people quit using drugs will it become safer for those of us in law enforcement and the rest of society. Thank you.;The President. The Attorney General tells me I can just conclude it. [Laughter] I didn't bring a whistle, and I can't think of a good get-off line, except I think that what we have just heard from this young man, his lovely wife—I think all of us know what's at stake here. And I think all of us are going to continue doing this until it's a chapter of our history that we can look back upon, but know that we'll never see that chapter repeated again in our nation's history. God bless you all. Thank you for what you're doing.</td></tr>

I have a statement here, a brief statement. First, I am pleased that Senate Majority Leader Bob Byrd and Republican Leader Bob Dole have agreed to take up consideration of the treaty to eliminate an entire class of U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles. This treaty, which was signed last December, has placed U.S.-Soviet arms discussions on a path that goes beyond arms control and toward real nuclear arms reduction. I am both hopeful and confident that after careful consideration the Senate will agree that this treaty is a diplomatic milestone and will give its consent to United States participation.;Second, the March trade figures were good news—the best news on this front since March of 1985. With the trade deficit dropping $4.1 billion and with exports up $5.4 billion, this is clear evidence that the trade balance is improving as our economy continues to grow. Now, several days ago I received a trade bill from Congress, and my message to Congress on this matter is currently under review, and I expect to issue it within a couple of days. But today's news emphasizes what we've been saying all along: that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on trade or reducing incentives for free, open markets or closing job opportunities. We want more jobs, not less, and we want a job market open to all working men and women in this country. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work with the Congress once again in crafting a trade bill that will continue this trend of more job creation and greater economic growth.;General Noriega of Panama;Q. Mr. President, why have you authorized the dropping of the drug indictment against General Noriega, and doesn't that give the Democrats ammunition for the Presidential campaign?;The President. Not if they'll wait until there's something to be announced. We're negotiating right now, and therefore I can't comment on negotiations that are underway. It would be foolish to do so. Some things you have to keep to yourself when you're arguing with someone else. But we're not—as I say, negotiations are underway. There has been no decision made on some of the things that are being discussed, and I have to say that I think that much of what many of you've been dealing with as a story is based on some kind of leaks or misinformation because there are no facts to sustain it.;Q. If I could clear up that one point, though, sir, haven't you authorized the dropping of the indictment in return for something on Mr. Noriega's part?;The President. As I have to say, when you're negotiating—and I did that for 25 years as a union officer in labor-management relations—you don't go out and talk about what you're negotiating.;Attorney General Edwin Meese III;q. Mr. President, now that the conservatives, personified by the Washington Times, have jumped ship on Attorney General Edwin Meese. And the loss of morale in the Department and loss of respect for the Justice Department in the country and its integrity—are you still backing Meese and have total confidence in him, or are you going to ease him out?;The President. No, I have complete confidence in him, and I know—;Q. Why?;The President. Because there have been a great many allegations made, but nothing has been proven. And I've seen no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part of the kind that is inferred in the allegations that they kicked around. And right now, on this particular thing, I think you'd have to talk to him about that. I think there's more than meets the eye with regard to this latest departure.;Q. What do you mean?;The President. What?;Q. What are you referring to? Do you mean that Eastland [former Director of the Office of Public Affairs at the Justice Department] did something to undermine the Attorney General?;The President. No, he made a statement himself that there was no animus of anything that had happened. But I think that you should talk to the Attorney General about that and what happened.;Q. Well, is that the role of the press officer—to be a defense attorney?;The President. Well, once again, somebody speculated that that's what was the reason there. And I think that you should talk to the Attorney General.;Democracy in Panama;Q. Mr. President, if you can't discuss the negotiations with Noriega, I'd like to ask you, however, about your policy goal. You have said in the past the goal was to see that Noriega step down from power. And at various times you've talked about leaving the country and various times you haven't. Is your goal to see that not only Noriega leaves power but that none of his cronies continue to exercise power in his name?;The President. I've said I wouldn't comment, but I'll make one comment on that. What we're interested in seeing is a restoration of democracy in Panama. It didn't start with this particular man. But some time back, under another one, the commanding officer of the National Guard in Panama suddenly began to take precedence over the President of Panama and dictate to the Government. We feel that it's time that democracy return to Panama, and this is what we're negotiating toward.;Q. Well, sir, if someone controls the Government-if Noriega pulls strings behind the scenes, is that acceptable to you?;The President. Not if we have reinstituted democracy there in Panama. But, again, I can't comment further on this. We are in the midst of real negotiations.;Q. But sir, the fear is that you're selling out. The fear is that you are going to agree to a deal which has a fig leaf of some restoration of democracy but, in fact, leaves Noriega in power.;The President. Oh, I know. I've been reading that and hearing it in the newscasts—;Q. Well, when you won't comment, sir—;The President.—and no, I'm not going to back away from what we're trying to do.;Q. Well, sir—;Drug Trafficking and Aid to the Contras;Q. Mr. President, there have been charges also that this government was aware of drug running involved with the possibly illegal contra supply operation. Can you tell us and the congressional committees that have been investigating that there was no involvement by this government, the CIA, or any other agencies of this government in running drugs on the same airplanes that were bringing weapons to the contras? And are you investigating, if you didn't know about it, to see whether there is any truth—;The President. All that I knew about any of this, until the indictment came down with evidently evidence enough to get to an indictment—that previously there had been some rumors he was providing information on—situation in Central America, I think, to our intelligence people at the CIA. Some rumors came up about possible drug and—but no one ever received or could get any evidence to substantiate those rumors. And then this latest thing happened, and I don't know whether he just had started or whether there was anything really going on.;Q. But, sir, there are other charges that there was other involvement by this government in drugs on the same airplanes that were delivering weapons to the contras beyond Noriega. Did you know anything about that? Is there any truth to that?;The President. No. No, the only thing I knew was when we operated a sting operation and found that the Sandinistas were shipping out drugs.;Q. Well—;The President. And unfortunately, the pilot of that plane in that particular sting operation was shot down in the streets of au American city shortly after the—;Q. But are you checking into these latest allegations?;The President. Yes, we are.;Q. Mr. President, how can you, given the hard line that you took at the very beginning in the situation in Panama—saying that Noriega had to leave the country, saying once that the Dominican Republic wasn't far enough—and our recognition of Mr. Delvalle as the President, how can you do anything in the way of a compromise without appearing to back down from your original policy goals?;The President. Again, you're asking me-that would lead into what's being talked about, and I can only tell you that we're not going to just whitewash anyone.;Q. Mr. President—;The President. I suggested two more. So, three, and then—;Astrology;0. Mr. President, you have repeatedly denied that astrology played any role in the setting of policy, but you have ducked the question as to whether or not it played a role in the setting of schedule. A number of aides, besides Mr. Regan, have indicated that astrology did play a role in the setting of schedule, including the timing of the signing of the INF treaty. Why did you allow that to go on, sir?;The President. It didn't go on. And this whole thing is built around an incident in which it was printed that this had to do with the scheduling of one of my operations. Well, it didn't happen that way at all. And you know something else: It didn't have anything to do with me being sworn in as Governor, taking the oath of office at midnight—or 1 minute after midnight. Back when I first was elected Governor-what I was doing that time was because once I became Governor-elect the incumbent Governor whom I defeated started filling up the ranks of term appointments and judges, to the place where I would have had a government all set up long before I got in. Well, I couldn't do much about it. He was still in office till I was signed in. I asked the people who'd been in charge of my campaign, Bill Roberts, when was the earliest that I could become Governor. And he said, well, the minute after midnight, the night before the inaugural ceremonies. And I said, I'm going to get sworn in a minute after midnight. And I got sworn in and at least had headed off a half a day's appointments that he wouldn't have time, because the next afternoon I was inaugurated.;Q. You're talking about a couple of specific incidents. Are you denying that either you or Mrs. Reagan, though, used astrology on any occasion during your time here at the White House to help set the schedule for trips or the signing of the INF treaty? I must say this goes against what a lot of aides are telling us, sir.;The President. Well, no, I'm only going to tell you that one thing, and that is that after I'd been shot, which was quite a traumatic experience for my wife—;Q. And you?;The President.—and it was not a—no, I was confident I was going to be all right. [Laughter] Other people can't know that. But she was getting a great many calls from friends, and a friend called and said that-or wished that he'd known what I was going to do that day and so forth because of—he mentioned someone, that all the signs were bad and everything else. And Nancy was—it was a trauma that didn't go away easily. And when suddenly things of the same kind just for a short period there—when I was booked for something of the same kind where the accident occurred, why, she would ask, what does it look like now? And no changes were ever made on the basis of whether I did nor did not conduct this—;Q. But why something like the signing of an INF treaty, sir?;The President What?;Q. Why something like the signing—;The President No, it wasn't. Nothing of that kind was going on. This was all, once again, smoke and mirrors, and we made no decisions on it, and we're not binding our lives to this. And I don't mean to offend anyone who does believe in it or who engages in it seriously—;Do you believe in it?;The President. What?;Q. Do you believe in it?;The President. I don't guide my life by it, but I won't answer the question the other way because I don't know enough about it to say is there something to it or not.;Q. Do you think the attempt on your life could have been prevented?;The President. No, this friend thought that had I been told that that was supposed to be a horrendous time for me, that I might have done something—well, we didn't.;Attorney General Edwin Meese III;Q. Mr. President, you have often spoke of your belief in the integrity and honesty of your Attorney General. I'd like to ask you another question, which is: Don't you think that all of these resignations and the difficulty of filling the job and the attacks from so many directions are—even if he is a man of integrity and ability—don't you think this is getting in the way of the Justice Department doing its job? And isn't that a reason for him to step aside on those grounds?;The President. No, because I think that there's been a wave—and for quite a long time, and not just with him, but with others—in which accusation or allegation is taken to mean conviction. And there's been too much of that. In this land of ours, you are innocent until you are proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And nothing has been proven. These allegations continue to be made. This has been true of others. This was true of Ray Donovan [former Secretary of Labor]. And his poignant line, I think, fit the situation. When he was declared totally innocent of any wrongdoing at all, he said, "Where do I go to get back my reputation?" This also applies to Beggs, who finally stood up and resigned from NASA because of things he was supposed to have done before he came into government and was found innocent of every—there wasn't an iota of any kind of support for any of the accusations.;Q. Are you saying then, sir, that unless Mr. Meese would be indicted that he should remain in office? Or can there be lesser allegations that don't require an indictment that would be grounds for him stepping aside?;The President. I think that for him to step aside would be what he himself once said: that he would then live for the rest of his life under this cloud, with nothing that had ever been proven.;Q. Sir, what about the—;The President. But you had recognized her all right. So, you're the last one.;General Noriega of Panama;Q. Thank you, sir. One more about Noriega. The combination of sanctions and negotiations have been going on for an awfully long time, and it seems as if the United States looks progressively weaker. Aren't you a little angry that Noriega has managed to humiliate and embarrass the United States?;The President Well, we had hoped that we could maybe make it possible for the people of Panama themselves to exert some pressure and do something, and I guess having run into their own armed troops willing to shoot, and shooting, kind of cooled that down. So, we're continuing to negotiate. And our goal remains the same.;Q. But, sir, are you not angry about the fact that the United States has been looking so weak when it's gone up against this man?;The President. Whether I'm angry or not doesn't count. On the situation in Panama, I will not comment on the negotiations that are going on in Panama. And at the appropriate time, I expect to have a full statement and make it to the American people.;Q. Will that be soon?;The President. I wish I knew.;Q. Mr. President, how badly have you been hurt by—;Q. Do you have a message for Don Regan [former Chief of Staff to the President]?;Free and Fair Trade;Q. Some people are saying, Mr. President, that if the trade bill were to be overridden by Congress the effect of the trade bill would be similar to Smoot-Hawley. Why is it that the administration now is basically saying that it's only the plant closings provision that's wrong with this trade bill, that otherwise you would support it?;The President. Well, that is the main thing. There are other things in there that I don't think are helpful or belong there. There's been a habit of adding pork items to almost everything that's up on the Hill, and that's true there. But this is the main one.;And when all of my colleagues at the economic summit from the other countries, the heads of state of the countries with which we trade—when they call what we have seen here in the last 5 1/2 years—called the American miracle—and when I have talked to them, they've asked me for questions about what are some of the things that we had done. I found out in answering their questions that they themselves deplore the fact that in their countries the rules and regulations imposed on government—including things like this and rules about hiring and firing—are part of what they say is holding them back and keeping them from having the kind of economic recovery we have.;Q. Ready for Gorbachev?;Q. Has Regan hurt your reputation? Has Regan hurt your reputation? Has Regan damaged your reputation, Mr. President?;The President. Well, I was worried about his.</td></tr>

Pursuant to Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.), the President may designate specified articles provided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.;2. Pursuant to section 504(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)), beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries pursuant to section 504(c)(2) of the Trade Act, are subject to limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP. Pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the Trade Act, a country that has not been treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article may be redesignated with respect to such article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in section 504(c)(1) (after application of paragraph (c)(2)) during the preceding calendar year. Further, pursuant to section 504(d)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), the limitations provided in section 504(c)(1)(B) shall not apply with respect to an eligible article if a like or directly competitive article was not produced in the United States on January 3, 1985.;3. Subsections 502(b)(7) and 502(c)(7) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7) and 2462(c)(7)) provide that a country that has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(4)), is ineligible for designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. Pursuant to section 504 of the Trade Act, the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any article or with respect to any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)).;4. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a), and 504(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2463(a), and 2464(a)), in order to subdivide and amend the nomenclature of existing items for the purposes of the GSP, I have determined, after taking into account information and advice received under section 503(a), that the HTS should be modified to adjust the original designation of eligible articles. In addition, pursuant to Title V of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate specified articles provided for in the HTS as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries and that such treatment for other articles should be terminated. I have also determined, pursuant to section 504(a) and (c)(1) of the Trade Act, that certain beneficiary countries should no longer receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles. Further, I have determined, pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the Trade Act, that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to specified previously designated eligible articles. These countries have been previously excluded from benefits of the GSP with respect to such eligible articles pursuant to section 504(c)(1) of the Trade Act. Last, I have determined that section 504(c)(1)(B) of the Trade Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985.;5. Pursuant to subsections 502(b)(7) and 502(c)(7) and section 504 of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Burma or the Central African Republic. Such suspensions are the result of my determinations that Burma and the Central African Republic have not taken and are not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the Trade Act.;6. Section 201(a) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (the Implementation Act) (Pub. L. 100-449, 102 Stat. 1851) authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuance of existing duties, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, and such additional duties, as the President determines are necessary or appropriate to carry out Article 401 of the Agreement (including the schedule of duty reductions with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada set forth in Annexes 401.2 and 401.7). Accordingly, I have determined that it is necessary to provide for the staged reduction in duties on certain goods originating in the terrority of Canada.;7. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to Title V and section 604 of the Trade Act, and section 201 of the Implementation Act, do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide benefits under the GSP to specified designated eligible articles when imported from any designated beneficiary developing country, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this Proclamation.;(2)(a) In order to provide benefits under the GSP to specified designated eligible articles when imported from any designated beneficiary developing country, the Rates of Duty 1-Special column for the HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex II(a), II(b), and II(c) is modified by inserting in the parentheses the symbol "A," immediately before the "E" in each such item.;(b) In order to terminate preferential tariff treatment under the GSP for articles imported from all designated beneficiary developing countries, the Rates of Duty 1-Special column for the HTS subheading enumerated in Annex II(d) is modified by deleting the symbol "A," in parentheses.;(c) In order to provide preferential tariff treatment under the GSP to certain countries which have been excluded from the benefits of the GSP for certain eligible articles imported from such countries, following my determination that a country not previously receiving such benefits should again be treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article, the Rates of Duty 1-Special column for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex II(e) to this Proclamation is modified: (i) by deleting from such column for such HTS subheadings the symbol "A *" in parentheses, and (ii) by inserting in such column the symbol "A" in lieu thereof.;(d) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special column for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex II(f) to this Proclamation is modified: (i) by deleting from such column for such HTS subheadings the symbol "A" in parentheses, and (ii) by inserting in such column the symbol "A *" in lieu thereof.;(3) In order to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for Burma and the Central African Republic, to correct the status of a designated beneficiary developing country, to provide that one or more countries should be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for purposes of the GSP, and to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for purposes of the GSP, general note 3(c)(ii) to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex III to this Proclamation.;(4) In order to provide for the staged reductions on Canadian goods in the HTS subheadings modified in Annex I to this Proclamation, effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates specified in Annex IV to this Proclamation, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in the Rates of Duty 1-Special column followed by the symbol "CA" in parentheses for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in such Annex shall be deleted and the rate of duty provided in such Annex inserted in lieu thereof.;(5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this Proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;(6)(a) The amendments made by paragraph (4) of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates indicated for the respective Annex columns.;(b) Except as provided for in paragraph (a), this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 1989.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.;GEORGE BUSH</td></tr>

Thank you, Dr. Fink. Modesty may not be his long suit, but I like the introduction. [Laughter] And very candidly, I like the pride he takes in his institution, and he gave me a good lecture up here as to how I should be supportive of these smaller and independent colleges. And it struck home to me, I'll tell you.;And Governor Deukmejian, I'm glad to be with you, sir. And our Commonwealth Club president, Joe Perrelli, thank you for your hospitality. And let me just single out our former Secretary of State, George Shultz. I'm honored to see him here and be with him.;I'm going to get in real trouble here, but another San Franciscan who served his country at a very high level is now giving of his time to work with me on the prestigious Science Advisory Committee, and I'm talking about your own and my friend, David Packard. I'm delighted he's here.;And just two more. I'm pleased to see the mayor of San Francisco here -- Mayor Agnos -- delighted to see him. And of course, another who I read in the paper had re-retired, or was about to re-retire, and I'm talking to the former head of the World Bank, Tom Clausen, an old friend who I'm delighted to see him here.;So, I feel encompassed by friends and delighted to be back for, I think it is, my seventh -- Joe, seventh? -- seventh appearance before this prestigious group. A few minutes ago, I asked a 49er fan what he thought was the turning point in the Super Bowl. [Laughter] He said, the national anthem. [Laughter];Of course not all the recent memories -- as Art knows -- in the Bay area have been pleasant ones. I'm sure you remember the last time I was here, after this city suffered tragedy. And I'm talking about a clutter of car wrecks and a flattened freeway and a terrible black cloud rising from the Marina district. And I know that some damage remains, and certainly some heartache and some hardship. But today I've sensed and felt something else: renewal. The people of the Bay area have stood up and dusted themselves off and are rebuilding because you came together. And San Francisco will be as beautiful and vital as ever. So, I think it's fair to say, from having been here for about 45 minutes, San Francisco is back, and we can understand that. [Laughter];But I've come here today to California for another reason: to give you a no-nonsense -- you hardnosed business men and women that you are -- a straightforward and hopeful message about the national security of our country. Yesterday at Fort Irwin, I also thanked our men and women in uniform -- not just because they keep America safe and free, but I came to thank them because they help to make possible the wonderful changes that are sweeping the world. I wish every man and woman here could have been with me as I talked to the young troops out there in the desert. It's very clear why every one of our Joint Chiefs keep telling me our services all have the finest, most dedicated young men and women to ever serve in the uniform of the United States.;And as the threats to our security change, so, too, must our defense strategy. In 1986 defense expenditures consumed 6.3 percent of our gross national product. As you know, I just submitted my 1991 budget to Congress, which holds down defense spending for the fifth year in a row, down to just above 5 percent of gross national product. I'm submitting this budget at a time when the postwar world that we have known, the world that began in 1945, is changing before our very eyes. So, to understand then where we're going, let me first review where we've been and where I think we are today.;The free world's first generation of postwar leaders had the cautionary example of their predecessors. They remembered that the Great War, the war to end all wars, was followed by chaos and conflict. They remembered that visionary statesmen after the First World War had tried to limit large navies, even outlawed war itself. But soon these great hopes faded in the face of unchecked aggression, and no pact could prevent World War II.;So, by 1945 our leaders had acquired a realism, a realism born of bloody experience, a pragmatism born of a sober appraisal of the world as it was. And from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan, our strength became the world's shield, our ideals of freedom and democracy, the world's hope. We paid dearly for the defense of liberty with our national wealth and with many of our youngest and bravest.;And so, over the past 40 years, our leaders continued to provide for war even as they sought peace. It was during the Truman administration, in this very city, that men and women of great vision and high ideals came from around the world to create an assembly of nations. And so it was, in San Francisco, 45 years ago, that the United Nations was born. Then, as now, the United States strove to balance its role as peacekeeper with that of peacemaker. We helped create the United Nations and NATO. And we encouraged Soviet change even as we thwarted Soviet expansion.;Those who crafted this new policy had a name for it. They called it containment and predicted that if we blocked the easy path of expansion, the Soviet Union would one day have to confront the contradictions of its inhumane, illogical system. The purpose of containment was not to defeat or humiliate the Soviets. The purpose was to preserve and extend liberty. The hope was someday to see, as George Kennan put it in 1947, "the gradual mellowing of Soviet power." It took nearly a half a century to vindicate this strategy, but we can now see the results: today the cold war is in retreat. That is good news, for no sane man or woman is nostalgic for the cold war.;We're inspired by this Revolution of 1989 -- heartened, for example, to see a man of letters and conscience in Prague move from prison to the Presidential palace. We are heartened to see the Berlin Wall fall, setting off a shockwave that upended a tyrant in Romania. And we're grateful for something more. Now, because of our strength and that of our allies -- now, thanks to the march of freedom and democracy in Eastern Europe and even in the Soviet Union itself -- now the prospects for an enduring peace are greater than ever before. We can now envision a new destiny for the nations of the Continent -- that of a Europe truly whole and free.;We are taking the first steps across a bridge begun by others long ago. And it's a bridge that can lead us from seemingly endless conflict to the promise of a lasting peace. But no matter how great the promise, we must be certain that the bridge is secure. As President, every morning I receive an intelligence briefing, and I receive the best information available to any world leader today. Yet the morning news is often overtaken by the news that very same evening. And the world is moving too fast to forecast with absolute certainty what will happen next. Our challenge is to manage this period of transition from the world of today to the world of tomorrow and safeguard the security of America in the process. When it comes to the security of this country, I would rather be called cautious than I would be called reckless. Our pursuit of this promising future must start with an understanding of today's realities.;Take, for example, our most recent proposal, warmly received by our allies and President Gorbachev. I proposed reducing the troop levels on both sides in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 troops. That balance, that balance encourages the less threatening future we envision, and it holds great promise. But right now, right now, the Soviets still have more than 560,000 men under arms in Central Europe.;On the issue of strategic weapons, we've made progress in the START negotiations. And again, I'd like to salute George Shultz for his very important part in this. And we now hope to slash dramatically the number of strategic weapons on both sides. It is these important reductions that Secretary Baker is seeking this very day in Moscow. That's the future we envision, and it, too, holds great promise. But let us not forget that right now the Soviets still have more than 10,000 strategic weapons. They are modernizing them, they have developed two new mobile ICBM's, and their spending on strategic defense is comparable to their spending on strategic offensive forces.;The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief, bound by the Constitution to defend and protect the United States of America. Now, some would have me predicate the defense of our people on promising but as yet unfulfilled hopes for the future. I will not do that. I am determined to seek with the Soviets the collateral to implement a new peace. In international terms, collateral means soldiers discharged, tanks dismantled, nuclear missiles demolished, and chemical weapons banned from the face of the Earth. Some see our measured approach as endangering the process of change. I see our approach as essential to change, essential to the security of this nation, and as the only way to a lasting peace. We have shown that American resolve can help further Soviet reform. And we've shown that American strength is the catalyst for arms control. And we've shown that the idea called America can inspire change. And now we must not let impatience, born of euphoria, jeopardize all that we hope to achieve in the future.;First, as Americans have always believed, our foremost goal is to prevent another world war. To do so, we will still need to remain fully engaged. European security, stability, and freedom, so tied to our own, requires an American presence. Western Europeans all want us to stay there -- every single country -- want us to avoid pulling back into an uninvolved isolation. I have the feeling that when the dust settles, the new democracies of Eastern Europe will feel exactly the same way. We must remain in Europe as long as we are needed and wanted. And the prospect of global peace, therefore, depends on an American forward presence.;Second, we will, of course, continue to reduce the likelihood of nuclear war. And that's why I will vigorously pursue the START talks with the Soviet Union. But arms control and strategic modernization are not competing strategies. Rather, they can work together to make the world a safer place. Just this morning, I went out and visited Lawrence Livermore Labs and met those visionary men and women who strive to make a nuclear strike on our country, whether from a nuclear superpower or some renegade nation or terrorist group, even more unlikely than it is today. And if the technology I have seen today proves feasible -- and it looks very promising -- no aggressor could be confident of the success of a ballistic missile attack. And that's what deterrence is all about.;And let's be clear: This purely defensive concept doesn't threaten a single person anywhere in the world -- the life of a single person anywhere in the world. God forbid, if it ever had to be used, it would be used against missiles, not against people. When some complain of the cost of developing such technologies, they should first consider the cost of not doing all we can to deter conflict and protect the cities and the citizens of America. And that's why I will seek to persuade the Soviets, through our defense-in-space talks, that, in fact, greater reliance on strategic defenses will contribute to a safer world.;Now let me now tell you something about the strategy behind our 1991 defense budget. First, new threats are emerging beyond the traditional East-West antagonism of the last 45 years. These contingencies must loom larger in our defense planning. Remember the threats of Libyan and Iranian terrorism. And remember the liberation of Grenada and Panama. And remember the dedication of our American servicemen on duty in the Persian Gulf 2 years ago, safeguarding not only the flow of oil -- safeguarding the flow of oil to the industrial democracies -- but an action also welcomed by many small nations over there who were afraid that the Iran-Iraq war would adversely affect their own freedom.;And remember, too, that there are more than 15 countries in the world that will have developed ballistic missiles by the end of the decade -- 15 countries, many with chemical and biological capabilities. Nuclear weapons capabilities are proliferating, much to my regret and the regret of everybody here. And inevitably, high-tech weapons will fall into the hands of those whose hatred of America and contempt for civilized norms is well-known. We will continue to work hard to prevent this dangerous proliferation. But one thing is certain: We must be ready for its consequences. And we will be ready.;Then there are the narco-gangsters that concern us all, already a threat to our national health and spirit. Now they are taking on the pretensions of a geopolitical force -- whole new force to effect change -- and they must be dealt with as such by our military: in the air, on the land, and on the seas.;Clearly, in the future, we will need to be able to thwart aggression -- repel a missile or protect a sealane or stop a drug lord. We will need forces adaptable to conditions everywhere. And we will need agility, readiness, sustainability. We will need speed and stealth. And we will need leadership.;In short, we must continue to deter both a global war and limited conflicts in new conditions. And for this reason, we doubly need to continue the modernization of our forces. I pray that it will not be my sad duty to commit American fighting men again into combat. But if I do, on my watch, the lives of American fighting men will not be shortchanged.;As I mentioned, just yesterday I visited the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, near Barstow, where our fighting forces prepare for action. It was at this very base that we trained many of our troops who fought with such distinction in Panama. And they were courageous. But being prepared is also the best way to ensure that wars are prevented. And after seeing our men and women again and talking with them, they are indeed up to the challenges of the future.;You know, I once read that Khrushchev once spoke to the Commonwealth Club for 3 hours. [Laughter] Perhaps he began this speech with these words: "Let me make just a few brief observations before taking your questions." [Laughter];So, I will get to my final concern: how all this change in our defense budget affects us at home. Many speak of the peace dividend. Few discuss the short-term cost of peace. There will be costs as we cross the bridge to a better future -- for dislocated industries and workers, for communities -- painful personal adjustments to be made. But America has always been willing to pay the price of peace. I know that some of the bases that have been proposed for cutbacks are in this area, just as many of them are in my home State of Texas. But let me state right here and now: There have been no politics in these proposals. Some talk about bases in Democratic districts here. Well, they're also in the same State as a great Republican Governor over here. I ask Congress to join me in a spirit of fairness. Longstanding critics of defense spending should not turn around and block the closing of a base in their home district. There's something just a little bit ironic about certain Members of Congress whose philosophy seems to be, make deep cuts, but be sure to cut in somebody else's State or somebody else's district. And we can't have that anymore. This is too important. I can't accept that. The taxpayers deserve better, and so do those affected by our decisions.;So let me assure you: If a base closes, it doesn't close Federal concern and commitment. You know, civilians who are laid off will receive top priority for placement in other DOD positions. The Homeowners Assistance Program will protect military and civilian personnel from falling real estate prices. And the Office of Economic Adjustment will work with communities to develop powerful new economic assets, new ways to use old bases. The Bible speaks of beating swords into plowshares. We're transforming military runways into municipal airports, and military bases into industrial parks and community colleges, and missile hangars into factories. I don't know how the pruning hook business is going out there, but we may go back into that too, cast them into pruning hooks.;You know, I know the American people will support these measures for a continued strong defense. My travels around this country tell me that. But to have the means to negotiate reductions and ensure peace, I will need the support, the cooperation, and consultation of Congress. We can now envision a time when the world is more secure than ever, when all the competitive instincts of modern man will be diverted to commerce -- even to football.;You know, I started joking about the 49ers winning the Super Bowl during the national anthem. But it's not how many passes Joe Montana completed, it's that he knew better than to rest on his laurels at the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, so should we. I will work with Congress to build a bridge to a more secure world. And if we work together, then peace itself will be the greatest dividend of all.;Thank you for inviting me to San Francisco. And God bless you all.;Strategic Defense Initiative;Q. Having reviewed SDI at Livermore Lab today, do you support moving ahead with the project?;The President. Yes, I do. And our budget calls for that. And again, I would remind the critics that it is defensive, that the science and technology from it will benefit not just this concept of a reasonably priced way of intercepting somebody else's missile, whether it's from a major power or from some renegade hand, but that the science will benefit, I believe, the environment. I believe it has enormous potential for other uses. I feel more strongly about that than when I went to Livermore.;Defense Spending;Q. Will the expected troop reductions bring about a savings that can be used to offset the increased cost in strategic arms?;The President. Yes, and I hope that there will not be a greatly increased cost in strategic arms. The Soviets have modernized. They've modernized their systems, and we have not yet. But I would hope that the resulting reductions in the strategic arms, which I am pledged to and which I will work for, will have beneficial effect on and will result in savings.;You see, I am convinced that if politics of international change are handled correctly and if things go more forward, we will eventually have far lower levels of spending. But I've spelled out for you here why I think that should be approached in a very prudent manner.;Trade and Competitiveness;Q. With the recent events in Eastern Europe, do you think we should now again prepare for a world economic struggle rather than be preparing unnecessarily for a military struggle?;The President. Well, I wouldn't necessarily shift priorities. I've told you the priority I place on defense. But when it comes to competitiveness of the United States, we should be struggling with that on the front burner right now -- and I think we are. And that's one of the reasons I increased dramatically R&amp;D spending in our budget. It's one of the inevitable byproducts of a better education system. It's why we're putting more emphasis on math and science. It's why I'm imposing on great scientists like David Packard and others to give us the advice on how we can become more competitive. It's why my trade negotiator, Carla Hills, and our Secretary of Commerce are doing their level best to convince people that if we are going to have free trade, that has to be fair trade.;And so, this competition on the economic front is big. It's going to get even bigger, in my view. And we've got an enormous job to do -- not just the Federal Government. We can't do this. Many businesses have already moved into much more -- in the sense of quality product -- moved much more into the sense of automation and modernization. So, it is a national goal that we be more competitive, but it can't wait until we get our defense program in line. It's right now. It's urgent.;And let me just throw in one, Joe, on the success of the Uruguay trade round, for those who are a little more technically oriented than some. The success of this Uruguay trade round is very, very important to our ability to enhance the rest of the world and ourselves by free trade. But we've got some big barriers out there. We've got some problems we have to overcome.;Budget Deficit;Q. Can you pledge that a certain amount of dollars from armament reduction be transferred as a reduction in the debt?;The President. No, I can't pledge that, but I am pledged to get the deficit down in accordance with the Gramm-Rudman targets. We will have that if we get our way with Congress, which doesn't exactly do things the way I want, I've found out. [Laughter] But if we get that done, I stated in my State of the Union Message that that should be an objective and to move right into it, the minute we are in balance, which would be in 3 years. Now, I expect there will be a lot of pressure on. You hear pressure today on what is referred to alluringly as a peace dividend. And it appeals to me. There are things that I'd love to be able to say -- we can put a little more in this research, or we can help this homeless person a little more, or whatever it is. The pressures will be on, but I think that it would be a very good thing to do because as a grandparent of 12 I must confess, like a lot of people here, you feel that we are burdening the generations to come with a debt that does nothing but click off at the beginning of each year an enormously high and even higher rate of interest that we're pledged -- interest account that we're pledged to pay on the national debt. So, yes, as I said in the State of the Union, that's what I want to do.;Defense Policy;Q. If the Soviet Union and others in the Warsaw Pact substantially scale back their military commitment, doesn't the U.S. run the risk of moving in the opposite direction of the world? Are we prepared to stand alone?;The President. No, because I think as I mentioned to you earlier -- and this is the truth -- our allies want us involved. They don't want to see us decouple or delink from Europe. They see the changes and welcome them. All the allied leaders -- and I talk to the leaders of NATO on a fairly regular basis -- they see and welcome the change, but they do not want to see the United States pull back into what would be perceived worldwide as some kind of a neo-isolationist decoupling.;And I am not suggesting that we can't save money, indeed, we will. If our proposal -- the proposal that I put forward -- is accepted by the Soviets and we negotiate out all the details and get a CFE, conventional force agreement, as we are proposing, I think we will see substantial savings that are made by the -- what do you call it? -- suddenly gone blank -- in terms of when you bring a guy back and he no longer is in the army. [Laughter] But it's not just transferring: it's a question of having fewer troops on both sides. And that will inevitably result in some savings.;So, we're aware that there's a chance to save, but it is not that we are going to be swimming against the tide with our European allies. And as I said in the speech -- and I recognize his question didn't indicate the guy that asked the question was asleep. He probably wrote the question before the speech, I hope. [Laughter] But what I also said is that I hope and believe that many of the new fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe are going to welcome a stabilizing presence on the part of the United States. Now, some will say that's sacrificing. And I say, no, it is in our interest because we provide a certain stability that wouldn't be there if we, the United States, weren't there.;Environmental Protection;Q. Do you see the freedom of the Communist country as a threat to the globe? That is, if they all want the comforts we have, will we use up the resources of our Earth at an even greater rate?;The President. No. I think there's an environmental awareness in the world today that is encouraging. I will readily concede there are some in what is known as the Third World -- I'm not thinking so much as the evolution of Eastern Europe into the arms of democracy -- but I think there's a feeling in some Third World countries: Don't you big guys from the United States who have raped, pillaged, and plundered the environment now come and tell us what we can't do. We understand that, but we've got to work with them and share our tremendously advanced technology, existing technology, as we work to find even greater technological breakthroughs to protect the environment.;But I don't think you're going to necessarily see that is because of the evolution of Iron Curtain countries into, hopefully, growing democracies. I think there's an awareness now in Europe about the need to have sound international environmental practice based on science -- not on myth but on science.;German Reunification;Q. As Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. progress toward democracy, do you foresee any potential military alliances being formed that could threaten the free world, such as a united Germany and Japan?;The President. No, I don't. And I think everybody that's interested in foreign affairs, I'm sure, has an opinion one way or another as to what happens on the reunification of Germany, but I think that can be -- well, let me recite, just as background, the U.S. position, which is self-determination -- and this is the NATO position -- self-determination. And then when it comes to borders, I believe Helsinki says no alteration in borders without agreement of the parties. So, that gives you a rather stable framework.;Now, you can read every day about the rapidity of change and what might happen in terms of German reunification. But I think it can be managed in such a way that it will not be a threat to Western Europe or to what was termed in the question, I think, the free world. And when I hear both West German Foreign Minister Mr. Genscher and West German Chancellor Kohl talking about a Germany that remains tied into NATO in some way -- maybe not a NATO in exactly the same form it is -- but that's encouraging. That's encouraging.;Soviet Role in the Middle East;Q. In the past, smaller countries used to play the U.S. versus the U.S.S.R. to get military and economic aid. Now that relations have improved with the U.S.S.R., and if we can anticipate continued improvement, what are the chances of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. working together to solve some of the world's problems, such as the Middle East?;The President. Better, far better. And I think there's certain things that the Soviet Union could do that would facilitate their role as a catalyst for peace in the Middle East. One of them would be to assist more, through transportation -- direct flights -- for Soviet Jews wishing to leave the Soviet Union to go to Israel. I think that would send a sign that their interest in the Middle East is not just on the side of -- what heretofore has been the side of the more radical states in the area. So, they can do something like that. I'd like to see them normalize diplomatic relations with the State of Israel. I think that would be helpful. But I would think that as the Soviet Union evolves in a more democratic fashion that some of the concerns we've had in the past will be lessened.;So, I wouldn't say that at some point they wouldn't have a useful role. I've cited two areas where I think they can have a useful role in building credibility not just with the State of Israel but with other states as well. So, let's hope that they can do something.;Soviet Reforms;Q. How can we help Mr. Gorbachev in his quest for a unification of his country -- in demonstration of his country?;The President. I think we can avoid doing dumb things. [Laughter] And that's my cautious approach. You know, he's facing some enormously difficult internal problems. And you may have noted that I have been -- hopefully on behalf of most the people in our country -- supporting perestroika. When for a few months into our Presidency -- mine -- why, people wondered: What does he really care? Does he understand these changes? Does he really mean it when he says, I support perestroika? I do -- and glasnost, the openness concept, as well.;But in the last press conference or so -- a couple of them, maybe -- I referred to support for Gorbachev. And I have felt that he has handled some extraordinarily complicated internal problems, problems inside the Soviet Union, with a certain restraint and finesse that I think demonstrates a real commitment to peaceful change. The last thing I think any United States citizen needs to do when you have the Central Committee meeting is to try to fine-tune it from San Francisco or Washington as to how they ought to conduct themselves. [Laughter] So, I want to be very careful about picking winners and losers or saying how they ought to do things.;But I do think that, generally speaking, it is in our interest to support perestroika. And I will say again: I think Mr. Gorbachev has shown a considerable restraint. And frankly, the dealings that I've had with him here, and then on the sidelines when George [George Shultz, former Secretary of State] and President Reagan were dealing with him, is that he's a man who you can talk to, he's quite open in his negotiations. He damn sure will tell you if he doesn't agree with you. [Laughter] I mean, you're not under any doubt about that. [Laughter] But it's a new approach. I mean, it's very different than dealing with some of the previous Soviet leaders.;So, I'm not here to anoint or try to shape the deliberations of the Central Committee proceedings in the Soviet Union this very day -- or that will commence again tomorrow, maybe. But I do think that there's an awful lot to be hopeful about there because I find we can talk quite openly. And I'm looking forward to a summit meeting. I don't know why all meetings have to be called summits. [Laughter] We tried to call the Malta meetings something else, and it lasted for about 2 days. [Laughter] And I mean it, because I think summit projects the idea that you have to have some massive breakthrough, or else you disappoint the rest of the world. And I've changed my thinking on this. I think maybe communications where you don't have to do that is better. And that's why I was on the phone with him the other day on a couple of matters. So, I'm optimistic about our dealings with him, but I cannot predict and nor can any of you, with any degree of accuracy, exactly what's going to happen inside the Soviet Union.;Soviet Chairman Gorbachev;Q. Please comment on Mikhail Gorbachev's nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.;The President. I'd hate to say I wasn't aware of it, but I wasn't aware of it. [Laughter] And I don't follow those proceedings too closely. [Laughter] But I've told you I would salute the man for his adherence to peaceful change in Eastern Europe. I mean, that, I think, is dramatic and, I think, worthy of a positive note. But far be it for me to try to influence the gurus that decide who wins a Nobel Prize. [Laughter];War on Drugs;Q. As far as the issue of drug trafficking goes and the world drug problem, could you please address the issue of whether or not military forces will be used in a more direct way in the enforcement of international drug traffic?;The President. No, not in a more direct way. Military forces have been used over the years. The arrest power rests with the Coast Guard. The coastguardsmen can be aboard naval vessels. But we have an interdiction network that is manned and operated by our military. But what the question implies to me at least, of a quantum leap forward in terms of this -- I don't know.;One of the things I have felt is that sometimes the military says, well, we can't undertake this mission or that because of readiness. It is my view that sometimes an exercise that results in the interdiction of aircraft coming into this country on an illegal mission is a good mission and should not be detracted from the readiness. So, I think that we're always looking at the mission of the military in this regard, but I don't want to give the military more arrest powers. I think we've got a very proper justice system in this country. I do think that they can be extraordinarily useful, and have been, in interdiction and in working with countries that want their cooperation.;Q. Are you prepared to use troops in the United States to enforce the laws against drug consumption, to cut down on the demand which entices the supply?;The President. Well, not to cut down on the demand. I don't think that's a function of the U.S. military. We have police powers in this country, they are properly defined, and that should not, in my view, be altered.;Q. There are many questions that ask why do you find it necessary -- --;The President. The demand -- let me be sure -- the demand side really relates also to education, to people -- this is bad, you should not do this. We've condoned things in this country that we should have condemned long ago in terms of narcotics.;Drug Summit in Cartagena, Colombia;Q. There are several questions that have asked why do you find it necessary to physically go to Colombia?;The President. Well, let me explain that to you because I think it's on the minds of a lot of people. I went to a barbecue in Beeville, Texas -- [laughter] -- and there were 800 people there -- not quite this big a mob. And I thought, well, these people are doing this to welcome me back to south Texas. And I decided I would shake hands with everybody there. We politicians are all alike, you know -- go out there and shake hands. Art, you know how that is. [Laughter] So, out I went. And I think about 15 percent of them at that point said, hey, you know, we're hoping you don't do this.;Let me explain it to you. In the first place, I am not going to do something stupid or macho. [Laughter] I love -- the guy they used to call timid is now "macho man" or something. [Laughter] It has nothing to do with that, it doesn't have anything to do with personal. It has a lot to do with the support for a courageous leader in Colombia.;And I believe, and I think this goes for those who have the responsibility of protecting any President of the United States, that the security of the President can be protected on this naval base, a place where the man has his own home that is cut off from the mainland except by one entrance.;And I don't want to send a signal on your behalf or my behalf that the United States says to this great President, look, our President can't come there, even though we think the security can be guaranteed, and thus push him, perhaps inadvertently, to make a kind of deal that he has resisted making with these narco-traffickers.;I talked to a foreign leader the other day from South America, and he agrees with this rationale. So, it isn't whimsical or a desire to be in harm's way. I think we've got good arrangements, and I think it is good, sound antinarcotic policy to support President Barco [of Colombia], who is doing an awful lot to protect our kids from the scourge of narcotics.;War on Drugs;Q. There are claims that the removal of General Ortega will improve our efforts at interdicting international drug trafficking. Do you agree with this?;The President. Yes, I do, because there's some symbolism there. And just as I think the extradition of Carlos Lehder and the Colombians' pursuit of the drug lord that was recently killed down there in battle in Colombia -- those things help, because if they see major participants, traffickers going about their life without threat, why, I just think it sends the wrong signal.;Mexico-U.S. Relations;Q. Since the Panama invasion, have our relations with Mexico improved?;The President. Yes. And I'll tell you one thing that was good. Our Secretary of the Treasury went down there -- I don't know whether you saw it on Sunday -- and signed with President Salinas, the very fine young President of Mexico, an agreement on Third World debt. I think that was a good sign.;Look, I think I know enough about this hemisphere to know that anytime a United States force is used in Central America, or wherever else in this hemisphere, there are going to be concerns built on a foundation of history that concern our friends and those who are less friendly to us in this hemisphere. But I've explained as best I can, through letter and by phone, to these leaders why we acted the way we did.;I will tell you that I am convinced not only is the relationship with Mexico good and is it strong, I see nothing but making it even better. And I'm going to work at that because Mexico -- we must not take for granted the fact that we have marvelously strong allies to our north and friends to our south. Sometimes, blessed as we are by our own geography, we forget that. And there could be an inclination to neglect our neighbors, and I don't want to do that. And I can't tell you that there has been no strains, but I think some of what you've been reading about South American reaction has been overstated. And I base that on some contact with the individual leaders in this hemisphere. But it's an exciting hemisphere. This hemisphere can be, in the next couple of years, totally democratic. We must not neglect it.;So, if somebody disagrees with me on Panama and South America or Central America, that just redoubles my desire to make it right, make them understand that the President of the United States is going to protect American life, make them understand that 92 percent of the people in Panama support what I did, make them understand that democracy now has a chance, and make them understand that we're going to assist that democracy. Once I do a better job of that, I think any last concerns about what happened there will be laid to rest.;General Noriega of Panama;Q. Why are we wasting time with Noriega when he cannot possibly receive a constitutionally fair trial without compromising national security? Why not send him to exile in a country willing to take him? [Laughter];The President. Well, the line is not very long, for one thing. And secondly -- [laughter] -- secondly, look, I would just disagree with the person writing the question that the given is he can't get a fair trial. Of course he can get a fair trial -- and we've seen that over and over again in highly controversial cases. And so, our justice system that bends over backwards to be fair will, indeed, acquit itself well in this case.;Q. Is your administration -- --;The President. And should. The man's entitled to a fair trial.;Foreign Policy;Q. Is your administration prepared to accept governments you dislike, even if they carry their public support, such as the Sandinistas in Nicaragua?;The President. Please define acceptance. [Laughter] I mean, my aspiration is to help and assist those countries in this hemisphere that want to walk down democracy's road -- freedom, democracy, the very changes that we see coming forward in Eastern Europe. Who would have thought we'd be talking about trying to assist Czechoslovakia a year ago? Or Romania? Or some of these other countries? So, I don't think we can dictate exactly what kind of system somebody else has. It's not our business, particularly if they have free and certifiably fair elections. But I think one's inclination is to help those who have the same reverence for democracy and freedom that we have.;Education Reform;Q. You stated in your State of the Union Address that you wish to improve education and to implement the goal of best by the year 2000. How do you plan to implement your goal of having our graduates be the best by the year 2000?;The President. Well, we have a sound program, what I call the Education Excellence Act, before the Congress today. It's complex legislation, but I want to see it passed. Probably get amended, probably get changed, but it challenges people to think anew. We've gotten the Governors together in a Governors conference that was more than just frill. What it did was get -- agree to set national goals. And in the speech the other night, I spelled out four of the national goals that the Governors have agreed should be national. And they themselves will get to work and redouble their efforts in their States and try to encourage the localities to implement the program that we've spelled out.;But let me be careful here, because it isn't the role of the Federal Government to do this alone. It can't do it. Seven percent of the educational spending in this country is Federal. And the rest, for very understandable and, I think, wonderful reasons, belong at the State and local level or private educational institution level.;And so, we can exhort, we can push for the kind of legislation, we can push for implementation of the national goals through the use of the bully pulpit in the White House. And then we've got to encourage the Governors and the local school boards and our teachers, when it comes to alternative certification and all of these things, to think anew. And we can do this. But we're trying to put some emphasis on things like math and science, so we can guarantee our ability to compete in the future. But the Federal Government isn't going to do it alone. It wouldn't be good, either, for the Federal Government to try to do it alone.;Mrs. Bush;Q. President Bush, this is your last question. And before I ask the question, I wish to remind our audience to please remain seated until President Bush and Governor Deukmejian have left the room. This is a summary of many different questions that I've received, President Bush, and that is: Where is Mrs. Bush, and how is she? [Laughter];The President. I know you'll never believe this, but I'm getting a terrible inferiority complex. [Laughter] She's fine. And we both have something in common now -- the vision thing -- because she has this eye problem. But she is doing very well. There is no hidden agenda to her health. And today she is down as one of the Thousand Points of Light, which she's been for a long time, helping on literacy in southern California. And I'll meet her tonight in Omaha. But she's doing just great, and thank you for asking about her.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Therefore, I am notifying the Congress of my intention to suspend the GSP eligibility of Liberia. Finally, I have determined to continue to review the status of such worker rights in Benin, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nepal, and Syria.;Further, pursuant to section 504 of the 1974 Act, after considering various requests for a waiver of the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)) with respect to certain eligible articles, I have determined to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP currently being afforded to certain articles and to certain beneficiary developing countries.;Specifically, I have determined, pursuant to subsection 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), that the limitation provided for in subsection 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Such articles are enumerated in the list of Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) subheadings in Annex A.;Pursuant to subsection 504(c)(3) of the 1974 Act, I have also determined to: 1) waive the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries, and 2) waive the application of subsection 504(c)(2)(B) of the 1974 Act with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. The waivers of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and the beneficiary developing countries opposite such HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex B. The waivers of subsection 504(c)(2)(B) of the 1974 Act apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and the beneficiary developing countries opposite such HTS subheadings enumerated in Annex C.;These determinations shall be published in the Federal Register.;George Bush;[Filed with the Office of the Federal Register, 12:19 p.m., April 30, 1990]</td></tr>

[Laughter] But we're very pleased you're here on this special day. And I want to thank Paul Coverdell for his leadership during this exciting period, this new period in the history of the Peace Corps. I'm delighted that Secretary Mosbacher is here, and Secretary Eagleburger and Robson and, of course, Chief Justice Burger. It's a pleasure to welcome you back to the White House. And we're honored to have the representatives of the Hungarian and Polish Governments here as well, Ron Roskens, the head of AID, and so many former Peace Corps veterans, Members of Congress here today. I'll be careful, I'm sure I'll omit some. But I see Silvio and Jim Leach, Tom Petri, and Chris Shays and others. Jerry Lewis was supposed to be here -- and Silvio Conte I mentioned -- for this historic sendoff rally. Most of all, we're honored to have this opportunity to salute a dedicated, committed group of talented Americans who were here to take leave of these shores and become the first Peace Corps volunteers to serve in Eastern Europe. And today we're very pleased to welcome all of you, to tell you just how exciting and important we believe that this new mission will be.;From the time it was first launched in 1961, the Peace Corps has been a thrilling and an ambitious undertaking -- lofty in principle and yet, in its day-to-day struggle with challenging circumstances around the world, as practical and down-to-earth as government ever gets. The United States Peace Corps built its reputation the old-fashioned way -- step by step, village by village, family by family -- bringing the world a bit closer, one friendship at a time. For nearly 30 years it has drawn 120,000 idealistic Americans from all walks of life and sent them to the far corners of the Earth. And for nearly 30 years, the men and women of America's Peace Corps have built bridges of understanding and good will between the peoples of the United States and the peoples of scores of other nations. And today we launch a new people-to-people effort through which the citizens of America, Poland, and Hungary can work together in the exhilarating process of building new democratic societies.;Paul says that in many ways it is as if the Peace Corps had been in training for this historical moment. It shows that our mission, our desire for peace, knows no political or geographic boundaries. I agree with what he has said. Barbara and I have traveled all over the world, and the experience has taught us one important lesson: History is made not simply by nations but by their people. And that's why your efforts are so very, very important.;With your arrival in Poland and Hungary, the Peace Corps will serve in 70 nations, including half of all the developing nations. And our volunteers do battle against the age-old enemies of humankind -- famine, illiteracy, poverty, and disease.;I think back to 1985, when we visited the famine-stricken regions of Africa and saw firsthand the heartbreaking conditions of those lands. And I remember visiting our Peace Corps project and witnessing the quiet heroism of young Americans whose efforts were providing relief and whose lives were truly making a difference. Tomorrow you will set sail for a different region, and you'll encounter a different kind of hunger, a different kind of craving from that which Bar and I saw in Africa.;But the hunger is powerful, and the need is real for the nourishment of free ideas and the sustenance of free enterprise. Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's beloved playwright-turned-President, spoke of this need when he addressed that magnificent joint session of Congress just last spring. And he said, "We must all learn many things from you, from how to educate our offspring, how to elect our representatives, all the way to how to organize our economic life so that it will lead to prosperity and not to poverty.;The key you carry with you will be the English language -- what Paul calls the language of commerce and understanding. And just as national literacy has long been the key to power, so today English literacy has become the key to progress. Like your liberty, your language came to you as a birthright and a credit to the dreams and sacrifices of those who came before. And today you're investing that birthright in the ancient dreams and the new ideas of faraway peoples and their own nations reborn. Your investment is America's investment in the consolidation of democracy and independence in Central and Eastern Europe. Peace Corps programs in Poland and Hungary, and then soon in Czechoslovakia, are another tangible element of America's sustained commitment to Central and Eastern Europe's democratic transformation toward a Europe whole and free.;The 121 Points of Light gathered today -- make that 122 -- [laughter] -- gathered today in the Rose Garden represent 121 reasons why this new Peace Corps initiative is bound to succeed: pioneers like Margaret Mary McGill, an Adrian Dominican Sister who has also pioneered the use of bilingual classrooms, recent graduates like Katherine Uderstadt, who taught math and reading to second graders in Massachusetts public housing, lifelong public servants like Washington's own Felix Lapinski, a veteran educator who has tutored in English across three continents, and volunteers like Belle Rothberg, who has taught English to Spanish-speaking working people. Born to Polish immigrants before the Great War, teaching has kept Belle as young as her ideas. She recently even taught a course on the American Dream. And Belle says -- the quote here -- "I remember my mother's yearning for the Vistula, and I have longed to walk in her footsteps. I love to teach, and I want to teach, continue to teach as long as I can.;Now, that's one great ambition, and that pretty much says it all -- speaks well of a great nation. To Belle and to all of you, we wish you Godspeed in this very important journey and wisdom and strength in the challenges ahead. Congratulations. Thank you for what you're doing for this country.

Additional U.S. note 2 to chapter 17 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), contained in title I of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590), as amended by section 1204(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (a)), authorizes the President, for such time as title II of the Sugar Act of 1948 (61 Stat. 922) or substantially equivalent legislation is not in effect, to modify HTS column 1 customs duty rates and quota limitations for aritcles classified in subheadings 1701.11.00, 1701.12.00, 1701.91.20, 1701.99.00, 1702.90.30, 1806.10.40, and 2106.90.10, if the President finds and proclaims that such modifications are required or appropriate to give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Previously, Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455), had added almost identical provisions to the former Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) in the form of headnote 2 to subpart A, part 10, schedule 1, in order to carry out a provision in the trade agreement known as the Geneva (1967) Protocol of the GATT (Note 1 of Unit A, Chapter 10, Part I of Schedule XX, 19 U.S.T., Part II, 1282).;2. The Sugar Act of 1948 expired on December 31, 1974, and it has not been replaced with substantially equivalent legislation. Proclamation No. 4334 of November 16, 1974 (39 FR 40739), established rates of duty, and an absolute import quota, for such sugars, syrups, and molasses, to become effective on January 1, 1975. Proclamation No. 4334 further proclaimed such quantitative limitations in the form of headnote 3 of subpart A, part 10, schedule 1 of the TSUS. Subsequent proclamations have modified such rates of duty and quota limitations. The provisions of headnote 3 to subpart A, part 10, schedule 1 of the TSUS are now set forth in additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the HTS.;3. On June 22, 1989, the Council of the GATT adopted a panel report that concluded that the absolute quota on imports of sugar, syrups, and molasses maintained by the United States pursuant to additional U.S. note 2 to chapter 17 of the HTS is inconsistent with the obligations of the United States and which recommended that the United States either terminate such import restrictions or bring them into conformity with the GATT.;4. Section 902(a) of the Food Security Act of 1985 (99 Stat. 1443, note) requires the President to "use all authorities available to the President as is necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture to operate the sugar program established under section 201 of the Agricultural Act of 1949 at no cost to the Federal Government by preventing the accumulation of sugar acquired by the Commodity Credit Corporation.;5. Section 504(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1984 (a)(1)) authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under section 501 of that act with respect to any article or with respect to any country, except that no rate of duty may be established with respect to any article other than the rate that would otherwise apply. In taking such action, the President must consider the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of that act.;6. Section 213(d) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (d)) provides specific rules with respect to imports of sugars, syrups, and molasses from CBERA beneficiary countries for as long as there is a proclamation issued by the President pursuant to the authority vested in him by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended to protect a price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane. With respect to imports of sugars, syrups, and molasses from all CBERA beneficiary countries except the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Panama, section 213(d)(1)(A) requires that "duty-free treatment shall be provided in the same manner as it is provided pursuant to title V of the Trade Act of 1974...." a With respect to imports of sugars, syrups, and molasses from the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Panama, paragraph (2) of section 213(d) provides for absolute quotas and further provides that such quantities of sugars, syrups, and molasses shall be admitted free of duty. However, the President, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, may suspend the quantitative limitations imposed under paragraph (2) if he determines such action will not interfere with the price support program for sugar beets and sugarcane and is appropriate in light of market conditions and may suspend duty-free treatment for all or part of the quantity of sugar, syrups, and molasses permitted to be entered by paragraph (2) if such action is necessary to protect the price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane.;7. Section 1204(c)(3) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (c)(3)) provides that is a rate of duty established in column 1 of the HTS by the President is higher than the existing rate of duty in column 2, the President may increase the rate in column 2 to the higher rate established in column 1.;8. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;9. I find that the modifications hereinafter proclaimed of the import duty rates, and the quantitative limitations thereof, on the importation of sugar, syrups, and molasses classified in subheadings 1701.11.00, 1701.12.00, 1701.91.20, 1701.99.00, 1702.90.30, 1806.10.40, and 2106.90.10 of the HTS are required and appropriate to give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the GATT.;10. Having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, including the anticipated impact on United States producers of like or directly competitive products, I further find that the limitations, hereinafter proclaimed, of the application of the duty-free treatment accorded under section 501 of that act with respect to sugars, syrups, and molasses classified under subheadings 1701.11.00, 1701.12.00, 1701.91.20, 1701.99.00, 1702.90.30, 1806.10.40, and 2106.90.10 of the HTS are necessary and appropriate.;11. I find that there are currently in effect proclamations issued by the President pursuant to the authority vested in him by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended to protect a price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane, including Proclamation No. 4940 of May 5, 1982, Proclamation No. 5071 of June 28, 1983, Proclamation No. 5164 of March 19, 1984, Proclamation No. 5294 of January 28, 1985, Proclamation No. 5313 of March 29, 1985, and Proclamation No. 5340 of May 17, 1985. Accordingly, I determine that the duty-free treatment of sugars, syrups, and molasses imported from beneficiary countries under the CBERA and classified under subheadings 1701.11.00, 1701.12.00, 1701.91.20, 1701.99.00, 1702.90.30, 1806.10.40, and 2106.90.10 of the HTS must be subject to the limitations hereinafter proclaimed, corresponding to the limitation of duty-free treatment for the same articles when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), as is provided pursuant to title V of the Trade Act of 1974.;12. I further find and determine, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, that the suspension of the quantitative limitations imposed under paragraph (2) of section 213(d) of the CBERA, as hereinafter proclaimed, will not interfere with the price support program for sugar beets and sugarcane and is appropriate in light of market conditions and that the suspension of duty-free treatment for part of the quantity of sugar, syrups, and molasses permitted to be entered by paragraph (2) of that act, as hereinafter proclaimed, is necessary to protect the price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane.;Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to the provisions of title I of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, sections 501, 502, 504, and 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, section 213 of the CBERA, section 1204 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, additional U.S. note 2 to chapter 17 of the HTS, and section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, do hereby proclaim;(1) Subheadings 1701.11.00, 1701.12.00, 1701.91.20, 1701.99.00, 1702.90.30, 1806.10.40, and 2106.90.10 of the HTS are modified as provided in Annex I to this proclamation.;(2) Additional U.S. notes 3 and 4 to chapter 17 of the HTS are modified as provided in Annex II to this proclamation.;(3) The duty-free treatment accorded to sugars, syrups, and molasses described in subheadings 1701.11.01, 1701.12.01, 1701.91.21, 1701.99.01, 1702.90.31, 1806.10.41, and 2106.90.11 of the HTS, which are imported from beneficiary countries for purposes of the GSP and CBERA, shall be limited to the quantities as established and allocated pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of additional U.S. note 3 to chapter 17 of the HTS. Duty-free treatment shall be accorded to the importation of sugars, which are imported from the beneficiary countries for purposes of the GSP and CBERA, as described in subheading 1701.11.02 of the HTS. Duty-free treatment shall not be accorded to the importation of sugars, syrups, and molasses, imported from beneficiary countries for purposes of the GSP and CBERA, as described in subheadings 1701.11.03, 1701.12.02, 1701.91.22, 1701.99.02, 1702.90.32, 1806.10.42, and 2106.90.12 of the HTS. Accordingly, the quantitative limitations imposed under paragraph (2) of section 213(d) of the CBERA are hereby suspended.;(4) All previous proclamations issued under the authority vested in the President by section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and headnote 2 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the former TSUS, with respect to rates of duty or quantitative limitations on the importation of sugars, syrups, and molasses, including Proclamation No. 4334 of November 16, 1974, Proclamation No. 4463 of September 21, 1976, Proclamation No. 4466 of October 4, 1976, Proclamation No. 4539 of November 11, 1977, Proclamation No. 4610 of November 30, 1978, Proclamation No. 4663 of May 24, 1979, Proclamation No. 4720 of February 1, 1980, Proclamation No. 4770 of July 1, 1980, Proclamation No. 4888 of December 23, 1981, Proclamation No. 4941 of May 5, 1982, Proclamation No. 5002 of November 30, 1982, Proclamation No. 5104 of September 23, 1983, and Proclamation No. 5297 of January 31, 1985, are hereby terminated and rescinded.;(5) The modifications made by this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after October 1, 1990.;(6) In order to provide for the continuation of previously proclaimed staged rate reductions on goods originating in the territory of Canada in the HTS subheadings in Annex I to this proclamation, effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 1991, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn followed by the symbol "CA" in parentheses for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in such annex shall be deleted, and the rate of duty pursuant to the terms of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement shall be inserted in lieu thereof.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifteenth.;GEORGE BUSH</td></tr>

Therefore, I am notifying the Congress of my intention to suspend the GSP eligibility of Sudan. Finally, I have determined to continue to review the status of such worker rights in Bangladesh, El Salvador, and Syria.;Further, pursuant to section 504 of the the 1974 Act, after considering various requests for a waiver of the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 24e(c)) with respect to certain eligible articles, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP currently being afforded to certain articles and to certain beneficiary developing countries.;Specifically, I have determined, pursuant to subsection 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), that the limitation provided for in subsection 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(1)(B)) should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Such articles are enumerated in the list of Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) subheadings in Annex A.;Pursuant to subsection 504(c)(3) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(3)), I have also determined that it is appropriate to waive the application of section 504(c) of the 1974 Act with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States.

Pursuant to title V of the Trade of Act of 1974, as amended (the 1974 Act) et seq.), the President may designate specified articles provided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.;2. Pursuant to section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (c)), beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries pursuant to section 504(c)(6) of the 1974 Act (c)(6)), are subject to limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP. Pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act (c)(5)), a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article may be redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in section 504(c)(1) (after application of paragraph (c)(2)) during the preceding calendar year. Pursuant to section 504((d)(1) of the 1974 Act (d)(1)), the limitation provided for in section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (c)(1)(B)) shall not apply with respect to an eligible article if a like or directly competitive article was not produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Further pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (d)(2)), the President may disregard the limitation provided for in section 504(c)(1)(B) with respect to any eligible article if the appraised value of the total imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year is not in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to $5,000,000 as the gross national product of the United States for that calendar year (as determined by the Department of Commerce) bears to the gross national product of the United States for calendar year 1979.;3. Sections 502(b)(7) and 502(c)(7) of the 1974 Act (b)(7) and 2462(c)(7)) provide that a country that has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a) of the 1974 Act (a)(4)), is ineligible for designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. Pursuant to section 504(a) of the 1974 Act (a)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any article or with respect to any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and 2462(c)).;4. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a), and 504(a) of the 1974 Act 2463(a), and 2464(a)), in order to subdivide and amend the nomenclature of existing provisions of the HTS to modify the GSP, I have determined, after taking into account information and advice received under section 503(a) that the HTS should be modified to adjust the original designation of eligible articles. In addition, pursuant to title V of the 1974 Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate certain articles provided for in the HTS as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries, and that such treatment for certain other articles should be terminated. I have also determined, pursuant to sections 504(a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the 1974 Act (a), (c)(1), and (c)(2)), that certain beneficiary countries should no longer receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles. Further, I have determined, pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act, that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible articles. These countries have been previously excluded from benefits of the GSP with respect to such eligible articles pursuant to section 504(c)(1) of the 1974 Act. Further, pursuant to section 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the limitation provided for in section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Finally, I have determined that section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act.;5. Pursuant to sections (502(b)(7), 502(c)(7), and 504(a) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Syria. Such suspension is the result of my determination that Syria has not taken and is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the 1974 Act.;6. Section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act (c)(1)) provides that the President may not designate certain specified categories of import-sensitive articles as eligible articles under the GSP. Section 503(c)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act (c)(1)(A)) provides that textile and apparel articles that are subject to textile agreements are import-sensitive. Pursuant to section 504(a) of the 1974 Act, I am acting to modify the HTS to remove from eligibility under the GSP those articles that have become subject to textile agreements and to make certain conforming changes in the HTS.;7. In order to correct certain typographical errors in the HTS, I have determined that certain technical rectifications to the HTS are necessary and appropriate.;8. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that;(1) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for purposes of the GSP when imported from certain designated beneficiary developing countries and to remove from eligibility under the GSP those articles that have become subject to textile agreements, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this

provision set forth in Annex II(b) to this proclamation is modified: (i) by deleting the symbol "A*" in parentheses, and (ii) by inserting the symbol "A" in lieu thereof.;(c) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for each of the HTS provisions enumerated in Annex II(c) to this proclamation is modified: (i) by deleting the symbol "A" in parentheses, and (ii) by inserting the symbol "A*" in lieu thereof.;(3) In order to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for Syria, to provide that one or more countries which have not been treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article should be redesignated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to such article for purposes of the GSP, and to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to an eligible article for purposes of the GSP, general note 3(c)(ii) to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex III to this proclamation.;(4) In order to provide for the continuation of previously proclaimed staged reductions on Canadian goods in the HTS provisions modified in Annex I to this proclamation, effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates specified in Annex IV to this proclamation, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in

In order to correct certain typographical errors, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex V to this proclamation.;(6) In order to provide for certain modifications to the GSP, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex VI to this proclamation.;(7) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;(8)(a) The amendments made by Annexes I, II, and III(a) to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered,or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 1992.;(b) The amendment made by Annex III(b) to this proclamation shall be effective on or after 60 days after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.;(c) The modifications made by Annex IV(a) to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdraw from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 1993.;(d) The modifications made by Annex IV(b) to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates indicated in such Annex.;(e) The amendments made by Annex V to this

On this occasion, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, we salute an elite group of military personnel who stand among the best of the best.;Emerging from the ranks of the first "All Americans," an infantry unit that participated in three major campaigns during World war I and saw more consecutive days on the front lines than any other unit, the 82nd was reactivated just a few months after the United States entered World War II. The unit was designated as the Army's first airborne division on August 15, 1942.;The first such infantry unit of its kind, the 82nd Airborne quickly established its reputation as a leader in courage and achievement as well. From its initial parachute and glider assaults into Sicily and Salerno, through its participation at the Battle of the Bulge -- where it helped to inflict the blows that led to the final collapse of the Nazi war machine -- the 82nd proved to be a fearsome weapon in the Allied struggle against tyranny. "Those devils in the baggy pants," as an exhausted enemy soldier once described them, found no sacrifice too great, no counter-fire too fierce as they stormed from the skies in defense of freedom. By the end of World War II, more than 3,000 members of the 82nd had been killed or were missing in action. Another 12,604 had been wounded. Today we know that their extraordinary selflessness and daring not only hastened the day of victory but also offered enduring evidence of America's resolve to preserve liberty and democracy.;Members of the 82nd Airborne Division have maintained its tradition of excellence well beyond the events of a half-century ago, and on this occasion, we also recall their more recent heroism in the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, and Central America. Just a fewe years ago, more than 2,000 Division paratroopers took part in Operation Just Cause, which liberated the people of Panama from a rutheless dictator. During the successful international effort to free Kuwait from the sinister aggression of Iraq's Saddam Husein, members of the 82nd proved, once again, why they are the United States' premier rapid deployment force.;Ready at all times to deploy anywhere in the world, and with just 18 hours' notice, the 82nd Airborne Division is a leader among leaders,a special object of pride among the strong and the brave. Thus, while all of America's service members and veterans deserve our respect and thanks, on this 50th anniversary of the 82nd Airborne, we raise a special salute to "America's Guard of Honor.;The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 270, has designated August 15, 1992, as "82nd Airborne Division 50th Anniversary Recognition Day" and has requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day.;Now, Therefore, I, George Bush, President of the United States of America, do hereby encourage all Americans to join in celebrating the 50th anniversary of the activation of the 82nd Airborne Division. Let us honor with appropriate ceremonies and activities the courages individuals who have served in the 82nd over the years, and let us remember through public and private prayer all those who have died in the line of duty.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventeenth.;GEORGE BUSH</td></tr>

The President of the United States, George Bush, faces Florida voters in 11 days. Tonight he is here in Miami to answer their questions.;Ann Bishop. Good evening. With Tom Wills, I'm Ann Bishop. Tonight from across the State, President Bush will be answering the concerns on the issues on the minds of Floridians. We're going to get right to it, and our first question is from Jacksonville.;Consultation on the Economy;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. During the first debate you acknowledged that while the present economy is nowhere nearly as bad as your opponents would like for the American people to believe, there is room for improvement. My question is, if you're reelected President, would you be willing to offer an invitation to Ross Perot or to Bill Clinton to discuss their economic plans?;The President. That's easy. I think the answer is yes. But if I'm elected, it will be to put in my economic plan, and I think I will be because I think we've got the best plan. But I meet with opposition leaders all the time as President of the United States, and certainly I'd be willing to discuss it with them.;Tax Increase;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Excluding your tax increase decision, if you could rewrite the history of the last 4 years, what one decision would you change?;The President. I gave you the main one. My view is if you make a mistake, you admit it. It's a little unusual in politics, but I think it's the thing you do. I made a mistake going along with that major Democratic tax increase. I say a mistake. It had some good things in it, put the caps on the discretionary spending programs, but it raised taxes. It was my belief that that was something we ought to do that would help the economy. I don't think it did at all.;I can't think of anything that fits into that league as something that I would view as a mistake of that proportion. I'm sure I make plenty of them, but give me some time and I might get back to you with it. I'm not sure this is a good time to be pointing out all your weaknesses, either. [Laughter];Cuba;Mr. Wills. Just before President Bush came to be here with us tonight he was in downtown Miami, and he signed into law the Cuban Democracy Act. Now, Mr. President, as you know, the Democrats have accused you of trying to make some political hay on this issue. Our first question, sir, tonight here in Miami, is concerning Cuban-American relations.;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Welcome to south Florida. My question is: Within the next 4 years, Cuba will join the nations that have democracies. What will you do and what will your administration do to help the people of Cuba?;The President. Well, I hope you're right. And I think you're right, because I don't think Castro can continue to swim against the worldwide tide. The tide in this hemisphere is against him, but so is the worldwide tide. Everybody wants democracy, freedom, market economies. Of course, Castro's got none of that. I think the answer is then to move forward with investment support for him.;You see, it's going to be private. The thing that's going to make Cuba move forward fast is you have so many Cuban-Americans who have done well and want to invest and create businesses. It's not going to be a drain on the American taxpayer. It is going to be investment that solidifies their democracy.;I don't think we're going to need special programs. We've got programs in the Caribbean for those countries, Caribbean Basin Initiative. We've got a debt forgiveness program that has helped move Argentina and Brazil and other countries towards democracy. Many countries, 43 more countries have become democratic since I've been President, 43. Cuba will be the next one, I hope.;But it's not going to require a lot of Government aid. Everybody hates foreign aid. It's not going to require that. It's going to require investment. These are industrious people. We've seen what they can do here in this country. With freedom down there, they can do the same thing.;The Economy;Q. Good evening, President Bush. In 1980, my home mortgage was 18.5 percent. We had a cold war, hostage problems, and global inflation, but my family and I had good jobs, savings with high interest, and excellent health insurance. Today I have inadequate health insurance, no savings. My children and their children are without jobs. My oldest daughter is losing her home with a 7.5-percent mortgage. My home in a mobile park is facing liquidation. There is a global recession and homelessness. Granted, with the cold war over my family could sleep better at night, but now my own party's opening speaker at our convention tells us we're facing a religious and cultural war. Can you tell me why I am any better off today than I was 4 years ago?;The President. Well, you're better off in the sense of interest rates, clearly. We've got to go back to the days when the Democrats controlled both the White House and the Congress, which they've controlled for 38 years. Interest rates were 21 percent. Clearly, it's better to have them at where they are now. You can refinance homes. Inflation is lower. That's the cruelest tax of all if you were a saver. I'm not sure you were a saver.;I don't, I'm not sure I understand what you mean about a cultural war. I had the mayors from the leading cities come to see me. They were the board of directors of the National League of Cities. You know what they told me? They told me the major cause for urban decay was the decline in the American family. These were not rightwing nuts or leftwing nuts. Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles was one of them, smalltown mayors that were Republicans from North Carolina, Plano, Texas, mayor. And this discussion of family is not something that I'm going to be driven away from. We've got to find ways to strengthen it. That's talking about driving drugs out of the community.;In some ways you're worse off, if you've got all those problems for your kids. But in many ways, you're better off, and I would cite some of the statistics that I've given you. I just hope that with this new job training program we've got, a program to get the burden of Government off of people like you, that we can do better.;But you're right, it's a global recession. I don't know how many people know this: Our economy is growing twice as fast as Japan's. People don't believe that. Germany had a negative growth. We have grown, albeit anemically, for five straight quarters. So when you're going through a tough economic time, you're bound to have hardships. I'm sorry you've got those, but I believe that job retraining, education, and stimulation of this economy for small business is the answer. I really do. Very good question.;POW - MIA's;Q. Good evening, President Bush. My name is Jill Hobbs. My father is Navy Commander Donald Richard Hobbs, and he has been missing in Vietnam since 1968. As you can imagine, this has been a very painful, heartbreaking, frustrating situation for my family for the last 24 years. Now with all the new information that's coming out of Vietnam, I would like to know what you plan to do to ensure that all of the live prisoners are returned, that all remains are repatriated, and that complete and truthful accounting of all our POW's and MIA's is given. I want to know what hope I have that I'll find out the truth about my father's fate.;The President. You have a lot more hope today than you did yesterday because this announcement that I made in the Rose Garden with General Vessey is a very significant breakthrough. Here's General Vessey, who is the former head of the Army, marvelous man, head of the Joint Chiefs, too. He went over there and came back with a lot of pictures, a lot of information that they had denied even existed before.;We think that today the announcement I made in the Rose Garden is a significant breakthrough, and I hope it leads to evidence that will be comforting to your family. But we just have to keep pressing on, and we're going to keep pressing on, trying to follow every single lead.;You're talking to somebody whose comrades died in combat. My roommate, this is ancient history, but my roommate was missing on the very first flight that I was in combat in the Pacific. So I hope it sensitizes me a little. I can't say I really know what you're going through.;But I think you ought to take some heart from this breakthrough today because I really believe that Vietnam now is going to -- we're going to follow up to be sure they do this, but that they've turned over a new leaf. They're saying, no more obfuscation, we're going to put people in the archives. They've come out with 5,000 pictures. John McCain is a former prisoner, now a Senator, he came back with -- they gave him, handed him pictures that he didn't know existed of his being pulled out of the water.;So I hope it leads to clues, and certainly we will follow up any leads on anybody that might be alive. But we've got to get the remains back, too. It's a breakthrough, and I just hope it proves to be something that is comforting to your family.;Child Care;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. My question, sir, is, what does your administration plan on doing to help the middle class as far as child care? It's beginning to look as though the poor and the rich are the only ones that can afford to have children. If reelected, what does your administration plan to do to help the middle class?;The President. One of our accomplishments was passing a child care bill, adequately financed, that gives parents the choice. When I came into office there was a prohibition against all but mandated -- almost all but mandated child care centers. In other words, the Congress would say, here's the kind of child care you have to have. I think it strengthens the family to do what we've done, get legislation through a not altogether friendly Congress at times, and get it through to give the parents the choice for child care.;It is funded, and I hope that it's of benefit to you. There are limits in terms of how much a person is making. I don't remember the exact cutoff price, and maybe you're a little beyond that. But I believe that we've taken a major step forward in child care, and I hope it will benefit your family. There are no new bills planned for it.;Mr. Wills. Mr. President, we have tried to bring together here in our four cities voters, citizens from all walks of life. And this next question comes to you, sir, from a man who is 17 years old.;Education;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Mr. President, I am planning to go to college within the next year. But my family may not be able to afford my higher education. It is a problem that many students and their families face in this community. As President of the United States, what will you specifically do if you are reelected to provide my generation with the educational opportunities that we need to succeed in life?;The President. First place, we've already doubled the funding for what they call Pell grants, that's for university. And I hope you've applied for that. Maybe -- I don't know, again, what your circumstances are. But we've doubled the funding on the Pell grants, which is the major way of going forward for college students. And again, as I say, I hope that really helps.;Our main education program relates to getting kids ready for college. Frankly, we haven't done a good enough job for that. And many can't simply get into the college. So our program is called America 2000. It revolutionizes, literally revolutionizes education. It bypasses the old educational bureaucracy. It puts choice in the hands of parents for public, private, or religious schools.;Now, some say to me, "Hey, that's going to weaken the public schools." It hasn't worked that way with a woman named Polly Williams, a black woman up in Milwaukee. The mayor, a Democrat, in Milwaukee strongly supports it. And we believe that if you get the quality of elementary and K through 12 education, that more people will be able to qualify for existing scholarships.;Then I think the answer to your question is keep trying to do as much as we can in the scholarship field and the student loan field for kids like you that probably need some support to go through the college of your choice.;Health Care;Q. My 5-year-old had this question. One of the perks afforded you as President is what basically amounts to universal health care. Since you don't believe in universal health care for the American people, why is it that you utilize this benefit when you can clearly afford to pay your own medical bills? And why isn't this same program good enough for the American people?;The President. Well, you've got a bright 5-year-old with very good English, "utilizing my benefits." [Laughter] That kid's not going to have any trouble getting a scholarship.;I'll tell you, I'm Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, and the Armed Forces provide this. This has traditionally been provided to the President. I have no apologies for it. But the kid is wrong in one thing. I hate to say that about your kid, she's very bright if she's that interested. My plan provides insurance for all. For the poorest of the poor you get a voucher. For the next group, like this guy's family back here, you're going to get assistance. You're going to get tax credit.;What I don't want to do is go to a plan that nationalizes -- in some areas they call it socialized medicine -- but say nationalizes medicine where you lower the quality of health care. The answer is to provide insurance to all, do more in terms of preventative medicine. Under Dr. Lou Sullivan, our HHS Secretary, we've moved out very well on that.;We've got to do more to get the costs of all this down. One of the things where I differ with Governor Clinton is, I think we've got to do something about these malpractice suits and these awful lawsuits that are raising the costs to the tune of $25 to $50 billion.;But put it this way: If your 5-year-old thinks the only way that you're going to get universal health care coverage is to have mandated Government coverage, I disagree with her. I think it's better to use this whole brandnew system of pooling insurance to provide insurance to the poorest of the poor and right on up. So we just have a philosophical difference. No difference about wanting to get it done, though.;Abortion;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. Your firm stand against legalized abortion has been clearly stated in the past and during this campaign. I'd like to ask you this: If the Supreme Court reverses the Roe v. Wade decision during your next term in office, do you think that States that outlaw abortion should make it a capital crime -- --;The President.No.;Q. -- -- that is, equating abortion with murder? And if so, do you think that women that receive the abortions and the doctors that perform them should be subject to the death penalty and/or life imprisonment?;The President. No, no. The answer is no to all of the above. But I do oppose abortion.;You know, I think it's wrong to have 28 million abortions over the last few years. I don't believe you ought to have abortion for a -- put it this way: If a 13-year-old kid can't even get her ears pierced without parental approval, don't you think we ought to have some restraints? Don't you think that that kid ought to have to get permission from the parents? I believe in adoption. I believe in life. I know my position isn't particularly popular with some, but this is something I feel in my heart, take your case to the American people.;But no, on the criminal penalties you're talking about.;Deficit Reduction;Q. Mr. President, good evening. How is your proposal on allowing people to designate income tax proceeds toward debt reduction and spending cuts supposed to work? And do you believe a citizen would be willing to spend his or her own money toward debt reduction?;The President. Debt reduction -- I'll get to his -- there's three things we need: We need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. A lot of the States have it. We need a line-item veto that says to the President, if Congress can't cut it, you can cut out the pork by drawing a line through whatever line you want in the veto, in the bill. Then they can override you if they want to.;On this proposal he's talking about, it's a new one that I have made. And what it says to the taxpayer is, when you go fill out your tax form, if you care as much about deficit reduction as other things, you can then kick off 10 percent, a little box on the tax return. That will all be added up. Say it comes to $40 billion, all the people that fill out the tax return, added to $40 billion. Then you have to use that money to reduce the debt.;And that's going to mean, then, that Congress is going to have to, working with the administration, reduce spending by that much. And that gets to be difficult. But it forces it, it forces the equation. And if they can't do it in negotiation, then you do what they call a sequester. The sequester goes right across the board, not touching Social Security, but right across the board to get the spending down.;It's rather simple. And some of the liberal economists ridicule it. But I believe those three things together can make a significant difference on getting this deficit off the back of young people like you. When your kids come along, if we don't we're going to be in real problems for the future.;That isn't easy. I mean, I can't stand here and tell this audience or the audience in Orlando or Jacksonville or Tampa that it's going to be easy. I want to control the growth of the mandatory spending program, not cut them, control the growth to inflation and to allow for population. But that means they're not going to be able to grow as fast. They can grow, not be cut, but not grow as fast.;Those things together I think are the way we're going to get this deficit down. And that check-off ought to be tried. If it doesn't work, change the law.;Hurricane Andrew Recovery Efforts;Mr. Wills. Sir, as you know, the people here in south Florida for the past many weeks now have been trying to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Andrew. The next person you're going to hear from really tonight is in the category of a special guest.;Q. Mr. President, Alex Muxo, city manager of the city of Homestead.;Mr. Wills. And I should add, Mr. President, that Alex is a nonpartisan officeholder, neither Democrat nor Republican.;The President. I'll tell you what I think about him in a minute. [Laughter];Mr. Wills. He wants to tell you what he thinks about you.;The President. I know he does.;Q. Mr. President, first of all, on behalf of all the south Dade community, we really thank you from the bottom of our heart for your support in this last few months. As a matter of fact, tomorrow will be the 2-month anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, which we all know the devastation caused in our community.;Although your leadership was unwavering, you know the outcome of what happened with the Congress with Homestead Air Force Base. One of the biggest concerns that we have now is if the medical facility and the PX isn't built immediately, this community, south Dade, Dade County, Monroe, and West Palm Beach and Broward, have the chance of losing as much as 80,000 retirees because those facilities aren't there. What can you do to move that along so we can keep these people in our community?;The President. Well, let me answer Alex's question. But let me tell you about this guy because -- and this is not a slow ball -- he's an independent. He's strong out there. He does what he thinks is right. Here's a man who, when his own home was devastated, was out looking after people in the community, and that said an awful lot to me. I think it said a lot to the people of Florida and the people across the country. And I think it stimulated a lot of support not just from us, from the Federal Government, but it served as an inspiration to what I call the Points of Light, the people here where they got this program Rebuild. You see a guy like this -- do it.;I hope we can push it. I hope we can get it moving. What Alex is talking about is, I made a decision that we were going to rebuild Homestead. I got hit by Congressmen and Senators from different parts of the country because in a shrinking defense budget they saw a chance to get this money to build the installations in their area or keep the bases in their area or transfer the facilities, you know, the intelligence facilities, antidrug facilities, somewhere else.;We got beat on it. We got some money, got a little, not near as much as we wanted. On this one, I think we just have to push on it and get it done. I don't think it's to be controversial. I mean, I think it's something we can get through. Our bureaucracy is what I think the problem is.;But we'll keep pushing. I mean, it's been an inspiration to the whole country. I will say this to the audience: Government can do a lot. When the Government's spending over its head, it can't do as much as it would like. But the private sector response on this is absolutely amazing. You go out there and you see people from North Carolina who were helped by you all when their Hurricane Hugo came along, and now they've responded. I went to Louisiana. There was a bunch of people from North Carolina and South Carolina over there, so that American spirit of helping one another is still there. I think you all demonstrated it as vividly as anything out of this hurricane situation.;Correctional Facilities;Q. With your present tax policies, what will you do to assist major cities and counties with their overcrowded prison populations on a State and local level?;The President. We have put more money into State and local police than ever. Spending is up for Federal. But we can't do the whole police corrections facilities bit. That can't be done by the Federal Government. We have expanded the Federal prisons. The Federal prisoners -- you know this, given your life to corrections -- have spent 85 percent of their time in jail. A lot of the States have a much less rigorous program.;We have an assistance program to corrections institutions, but I just hate to stand here and try to promise you that we can increase it. What we have done is increase the funding considerably for Federal prisons, and we've increased it for local law enforcement support, but not as much in the prison field.;Now the answer, I guess, is to continue to try to help as much as we can and then press forward with programs that are going to reduce the incidence of crime.;I come back to a program we call "Weed and Seed," where you weed out the criminals. I don't know whether you've had any -- working with it at all. But it's a good new approach, gets across partisan lines. It says weed out the criminals and then seed the communities with hope. Then that gets to our whole urban agenda, so people have jobs in these cities through enterprise zones and tenant management, homeownership, as opposed to the hopelessness and despair that results in the crimes that you, fortunately, are helping on.;Women's Health Care;Q. Women's health could be a prime area of research for the National Institutes of Health, especially in the areas of breast, ovarian, and cervical cancer. However, Dr. Healy, the Director of the NIH, has stated that focus on women's health was not necessary. How would you in your next term ensure that the NIH increased research and funding in women's health?;The President. Well, again, I don't want to be under false colors. Every question, almost, says how much more money can you spend from the Federal Government, every one. And I can understand it. There is a new program for breast cancer, and it's pretty well financed out of HHS. I'll have to look at the NIH funding. I don't remember Ms. Healy saying that, Dr. Healy. She's a very able head of NIH.;And I'm not trying to put you down at all, because, look, that is a tremendously important cause. The next question I'll get will probably be on AIDS. We're spending up from $4.2 billion to $4.9 billion. And people say, "Well, you got to do more." I'm standing here telling these guys how we're going to get the deficit down. You can't do it painlessly. You can't do it by slapping more taxes on an overtaxed population. So we're dealing with somewhat of a restricted budget in doing all these things.;But let me check on NIH. I'm not just putting you off, but I don't believe that NIH is opposed to any women's health care efforts. And our early prevention programs that Dr. Sullivan is sponsoring can help get the problem -- you're a nurse, so you know much more about it than I do -- but can help before you have to be putting the serious treatment to people.;Ross Perot;Q. My regards to you, President Bush. My question to you is, why is there such an integrity vacuum in today's government? The silent majority, like myself, can find more answers and solutions to the problems in America today in a book written by Ross Perot, "United We Stand," than by any of the present elected officials. And why haven't you initiated a special group of highly trained individuals to address these problems one by one until each Department has been corrected?;The President. That's a good question. But you see, I differ with Mr. Perot. I don't want to touch Social Security. He has in his program doing something about reducing Social Security for some. I don't think we ought to do that. I think we ought to set Social Security aside. It's not just another guaranteed program. It is a rather sacrosanct program with a trust fund. And so I have a difference with him on that.;I don't think we need a 50-cent -- in your hand there in that plan is a 50-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax. Now, a lot of people have to ride to work, and where you have big distances, that is overwhelming. Or if you're a cab driver, the poor guy's trying to make ends meet, or a truck driver, he doesn't need to pay 50 cents more per gallon.;So I don't want to spend a lot of time looking at things that I'm opposed to. Now, in terms of what Perot is suggesting in terms of really having to do something on the spending side, I think he's on to something there, but not in these specifics that I've given you. And so I'm not going to spend the taxpayers' money with having a whole new group of people coming in to study something that I'm certainly not -- going to oppose, or that people will oppose if they elect me. I mean, I don't think a Social Security increase or a gasoline tax is the answer at this time.;So that's why I would -- but don't let me try to put you down by saying there's no good ideas in there, there are. I think we've got enough study groups. What we need to do is get something done.;I've got one difference with him. You just can't open the hood, say fix it. I mean, you've got to work with the Congress. And I don't mean to put the blame -- I'll accept blame. But when you're working with Congress, it ain't that easy, believe me. Look at Alex's problem. Here we had a problem that would have helped the community just to keep something that was there, rebuild it. You've got all these contrasting interests. I go up as President, say restore Homestead, and you can't dictate to them. They're tough. You've got to hit them over the head like that mule with a two-by-four.;But the good news, there's good news, they screwed up that two-bit bank up there and that post office so bad that there are going to be 100 new Members of Congress. And maybe we can get things moving much quicker the next term.;AIDS;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. I bring a question that comes from clients and other professionals in my agency. They'd like to know why over the last 4 years when the Names Project has been in Washington three times, you have not visited the Names Project, which now contains more than 26,000 panels for those who have died of AIDS?;The President. Well, that's a good question. I have felt a little bit unloved by the AIDS community. We have spent, as I say, far more money on research, far more, I think, money on compassionate programs. We've got the NIH with their great researchers out there geared up. What happens to me when I go out -- and I shouldn't judge the whole community by the excesses, but they've got an outfit called ACT - UP. And they come to my home and throw condoms around and behave in a very bad fashion. They break up your political appearances.;I don't think that helps the cause any. And I don't want to be a lightning rod in a compassionate project like this quilt project by going out there. I can take it. Good God, I've seen worse characters than those. But they don't help the cause any. For me to go as a lightning rod out onto those grounds to be yelled at and screamed at and as a symbol, I don't think it helps the AIDS problem.;The AIDS problem requires compassion, requires understanding. Both Barbara and I have been to clinics and held AIDS babies and tried to demonstrate the concern we feel. But to be a lightning rod for the excesses, I don't think that is good for the President of the United States. And that's my very frank feeling on it.;Maybe we differ. Maybe you can make a case for ACT - UP. I can't. When they come to a guy's home, little home village, and stand there with outrageous behavior, I'm afraid I just have to say I don't agree with that. I don't agree with them going into a Catholic cathedral, when people are on their knees worshiping, and start throwing condoms around. I don't want to be the symbol for that kind of behavior. I want to help that. I want to help with research. I want to see compassion. But I don't want to be the catalyst for excess. That's why I didn't do it.;Communism;Q. As a major foreign policy accomplishment, you have consistently maintained in this campaign that you deserve credit for the dissolution of communism. How can you prove that communism is virtually dead when more than one billion Chinese and, importantly, more than 10 million Cubans in our backyard are still committed to undemocratic governments?;The President. Well, I don't say communism is totally dead. I say imperial communism is, if not dead, stretched out on the slab there about to be buried, because you don't have the Soviet Union anymore. For years we had a cold war going on between the Soviet Union. That ended. That ended when I was President. And I think our policies had a lot to do with it.;Do you remember, do you remember about 12 years ago people were saying, "Nuclear freeze, the only way you're going to solve nuclear terror for the kids is to freeze, stop right where we are." If we'd have done that, there would have been no driving force to get the Soviet Union moving towards democracy and to get rid of their nuclear weapons. I stood out there in the East Room of the White House and made a deal with Yeltsin to get rid of every single SS - 18. Those are the big, destabilizing, multiwarheaded nuclear missiles. That is a major accomplishment for all the kids.;But you're right. I gave a big speech here today on Cuba. The guy's trying to keep his snorkel out of the water. Castro, he's not reaching out trying to corrupt the Dominican Republic and these other people.;And China, we've got big differences with them. What's happening in China, though, is their economic side of the house is moving toward market forces. And that's going to lead them to political change. That's why I don't want to cut off relations with China.;I'm glad you asked it because if I left the impression that I think there's no more communism anywhere, I should clear that up. There is, but it's not what I call imperial communism that's trying to take over its neighbors. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. I didn't realize I'd been that unclear on it.;Space Programs;Q. I'm an aerospace worker. In obtaining funding for space station, it's been tough going through the Democrat-controlled Congress. My question is, specifically, how committed will your new administration be towards funding our space station and our future space programs at Kennedy Space Center?;The President. Rick, I'm committed, and my word is on the line on that. It's in every budget we've sent forward. We're going to continue to fight for it. One of the places I might be able to do better on is to convince people that the research that goes into the space station and the space station itself will benefit not just those interested in space but all mankind. Now, you guys know this. The fallout in medicine and other fields from our space effort already has been appreciable. Agriculture has benefited.;So I am committed. I will keep fighting for it. We have a big fight with Congress because when money is tight, as it is, you've got to set priorities. But research and development is going to lead this country to a brandnew level of prosperity for young people. And you guys are on the cutting edge. So we're going to fight again in the next Congress for it.;Ms. Bishop. Mr. President, Diane Tass is with us, and she has a question not only important to the country but terribly important to this community.;Airline Industry;Q. I wanted to know, Mr. President, how do you plan to support some of these airlines that are being edged out by the big three or four, and especially for just the average traveler who, once we get down to three or four airlines, we're not going to be able to travel on vacations? Also I want to know how you feel about the USAir-British Airways alliance.;The President. Good questions. First I've got to start off with, we may have a philosophical difference. I don't believe it's the Government's role to say how many airlines there are going to be, which ones are going to survive, which ones not. The market has to do that for the most part, unless you want to go to state-owned airlines. And I don't want to do that.;So we're just going to have to be as competitive as possible. The problem with my argument is, a little bit, is that there are some Government controls on airlines because the routes are set. But I still don't want to see Government saying who's going to get in, who can't get in, who's got to get out.;On the USAir deal, it's a tough one right now. It boils down to this, that British Air wants to take over USAir. USAir workers are picketing me out here in the field when I land, wherever I land, wherever there's any USAir. Standing next to them in the field are the American Airline pickets, all decent, wonderful Americans, all concerned about their jobs. American Airlines are saying, "Don't let British come in and take over USAir unless we get access to the European markets.;Now, here's what will seem like a hedge to you. This matter is now under adjudication with the Secretary of Transportation. And to prejudge what his decision is, I would be -- I wouldn't be run out of office, but I'd have a lot of explaining to do in the legal community. And I'm not going to do it. But it is being heard. The interests are very difficult because you've got people whose jobs are going to be threatened one way or the other. It will come to me. I'm not ducking it, it will come to me. But I have to wait until we hear from the Department before I tell you what I think is going to happen on the British Air-USAir proposed merger.;On balance, on general statement, please discount airlines, I think we need more access to foreign markets in everything, whether it's agriculture or whether it's textiles or whatever it is. Exports have saved us in an extraordinarily difficult global recession, and exports are going to lift us up and lead us out of it. But they aren't if we don't hammer away and get more access to foreign markets.;Thank you.;Retraining Military Personnel;Q. Good evening, Mr. President.;The President. Hi.;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. I'm Sergeant Oliver, stationed at MacDill Air Force Base. What type of program or help will you offer those military members who are now being forced out of the military?;The President. Just signed a bill today, the Defense Authorization Act, which also included this Cuban Democracy Act, I might add, signed it in Miami. And that has a significant numbers of millions, up in the hundreds of millions, for retraining and relocation.;The sergeant puts his finger on something. Because we were successful, Desert Storm, around the world, we are cutting back on defense. I've cut back on it significantly. My opponent Governor Clinton and Ross Perot want to cut it $50 billion more. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to wait until I get a recommendation by Colin Powell and Dick Cheney, in whom I have total trust and whom the Nation trusts, because I think, even though there are problems in this world, I mean, a lot of the problems have been solved, there still are wolves out there. And we'd better be strong.;But back to your question. The new defense authorization bill authorizes significant funds for exactly what you're talking about. But let's not let them cut into the muscle of our defense.;Taxes;Q. It is my understanding that capital gains tax reduction is actually supported by Bill Clinton. Is he not letting the public know this because a reduction of capital gains would actually help the middle class as much, if not more, than it would help the so-called wealthy? And isn't it true that the only time we should be happy about taxes is when ours are going down and not when anybody else's are going up?;The President. Well, you're my kind of guy. That's what I think. [Laughter] But for years the Democrats have been beating up on me saying capital gains is a tax break for the rich. Let me tell you something. For months I've been asking the Congress to pass an investment tax allowance, a tax credit for the first-time homebuyer, and a cut in capital gains, not to help some rich guy but to create new small businesses. Small businesses employ two-thirds of the people. Jobs in the private sector would have been enhanced. I'm going to keep on fighting for breaks for small business, and one of them is capital gains.;I cannot get that point across. And if Governor Clinton is for it, he's whispering in one place and then -- the first bad thing I've said about the guy tonight. But look, you can't be on all sides of every issue. And if he's for it, stand up and get his Members of Congress, who allegedly are -- who are opposed to it, to say, "I will support this man. I will get it through." I have big differences with him, and this may be one of them. But if he's for it, he's whispering it to the business guys but not saying anything to the rest of the people about it.;Young Voters;Q. Mr. Bush, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have reached out to young voters with their recent appearances on MTV. Why have you and Vice President Quayle rejected such opportunities to reach out to 18- to 24-year-old voters?;The President. Hey, we're trying to reach out to them with programs. I'm not too much of a mod MTV man. But I don't think what program you appear on -- I can't play the saxophone, but I know a good deal about issues. And so you can't be everywhere. I think our programs have strong appeal for young people, whether it's education reform or whether it's on the health care so their families have a much better break on that, whether it's on college scholarships where our record is superb in terms of these Pell grants.;But look, there's something funny going on in American politics. I've been doing this kind of program since 1978 in forums that were called "Ask George Bush." And I like it. I feel comfortable.;Some of the programs to get out there and kind of outdo Oprah or Phil Donahue, that's not my style. Maybe MTV would be a good one, and I'll think about it. But you can't do them all, and you shouldn't be judged by whether you go on one single network or one single program. That's my answer.;National Debt;Q. Good evening, President Bush. How do you envision American life and standard of living in 5 to 10 years if the national debt isn't controlled?;The President. Not good. But I think we can control it. You've got to start by controlling the growth of mandatory spending and not do it by raising people's taxes. And I think that will stimulate economic growth.;We're limping along. We've had five straight quarters of economic growth. The definition of recession is two straight quarters of negative growth. We haven't had negative growth for five quarters. That's over a year and a -- maybe six now, because the end of September, I think we'll find we grew. So we've had very anemic growth, caught up in an economic global recession in some countries, slowdown in others. We're going to come out of that. The way we're going to come out of it, I believe, is by controlling the growth of our spending, by stimulating through the kinds of tax proposals I told him about, and getting this country growing. After the last recession, we grew at 5.4 percent. Now we're growing at 1.7 or 1.8 percent, maybe up into 2 now. And it's too anemic.;So you've got to have economic programs that are going to stimulate growth. And when that happens, then the standard of living, the standard of living goes up. Personal income is up in this country. Agricultural income has reached a high under our administration. Please don't wait to hear about that on the top of the CBS evening news or NBC or ABC -- I've got to be careful here -- because you don't get much good economic news out there. The unemployment claims went down yesterday, the biggest since, I think, 2 years, and I didn't even hear about it on the news.;I'm not saying everything's perfect. A lot of people are hurting. But don't despair about the future standard of living if we get in there and bring a lot of new Members of Congress and say, now let's do what the people want done. I don't think they want their taxes raised. I do think they want to stimulate the economy.;Family Leave Bill;Q. Mr. President, time and time again you have used your veto power to go against the wishes of the American public. You did this by vetoing the family leave bill, something that I feel our country really needed. At a time when your campaign has pushed for family values, how could you veto the bill? And please don't tell me that it was so it wouldn't hurt small businesses. From what I understand -- --;The President. That's a good answer to it.;Q. -- -- those with less than 50 employees would have been exempt. Is that true?;The President. They would have been exempt, but we have a better idea. In the first place, I keep telling everybody here, and I'll tell them up there, the thing that's going to lead us out of this into recovery is small business. They do not need any more mandates from Washington.;My approach was a tax credit approach. And that includes -- what are those eyes going up? You don't agree with it. [Laughter] I saw you rolling your eyes. But my approach says why not the lower than 50? Why not the mom-and-pop store? Why not others? And my program would have covered them all. You want to go with having the Government dictate all this, and to say that that veto makes me less on family? I'm sorry. I reject it. It's a philosophical difference. And let's get a little more support out of these who think the Government can do it all for some ways to strengthen the American family, as those mayors urged us to do.;I'm for family leave. I am not for needlessly burdening small businesses. So I am telling you what you don't want to hear. Sorry about that.;Enterprise Zones;Q. I'd like to ask you, considering the financial constraints facing cities yet the increasing need, would you support a plan to offer low or interest-free loans to local or State governments for infrastructure improvements?;The President. I'd rather do it through enterprise zones. I'd rather do it through tax breaks to bring jobs into the inner cities. That's my priority. And it's a program -- when L.A. blew up, L.A., South Central, the Mayor, the Governor, and Peter Ueberroth all came back. I arranged for a meeting in the Cabinet Room with the Speaker and Gephardt, the leader of the Democrats in the House, and the Senate leaders. All three of those people from California said the way to help the cities is through enterprise zones, urban enterprise zones. So that's my preferred approach, rather than the one you suggest. I really think it will work. I believe it will work.;Aid to Russia and the Federal Budget;Q. My question is as follows: Do you believe that the United States must invest a significant amount of money in the Russian economy in order to help Mr. Yeltsin's newfound democracy, prevent a resurgence of the hardliners, and perhaps initiating a new cold war? And part two of the question is, how do you think this would influence in balancing the budget?;The President. The answer to your question is yes, I believe it. We have already passed on a bipartisan basis a thing called the FREEDOM Support Act. It's like an insurance policy. It says we spent trillions of dollars in the cold war, and now Boris Yeltsin, the guy that stood on the tank and brought democracy forward in Russia, needs support. The Russian people need it. And we've already done it. I don't think we need more of that regard.;But you raise a good point. Anything we do of that nature makes balancing the budget more difficult, any spending. All these programs we're being asked about tonight makes getting the deficit down hard. So what you have to do is put together a budget, as I do every year. Four straight years I've had budgets that get in balance, putting to the Congress over 5 years. You can't do it in one. Included in the last one is funding for the FREEDOM Support Act.;But the man's on to something. I mean, I happen to think that this is an insurance policy with Russia. I don't want to see them go back to totalitarianism. Let's hope that this approach keeps them from doing that. But it costs money. And we've got to recognize it every time. Whether it's a program here or a program there, the taxpayer is bearing the burden.;Haiti;Q. Mr. President, your own immigration officials interviewed Haitian refugees and found 40 percent were not economic migrants but had credible fears of political persecution in Haiti. We correctly give asylum to Cuban refugees. Why since May have you ordered the Coast Guard to repatriate all of the Haitian boat people to a dictatorship we don't even recognize and which the State Department says executes and tortures its own people and which actually fingerprints the arrivals in Port-au-Prince and photographs them? And lastly, if you're really serious about restoring Haiti's ousted democratically elected government, why do you let oil and other essential supplies reach Haiti's dictators from Europe?;The President. Let me answer the last part first. We're not trying to starve the people of Haiti, and we're not trying to freeze them or cook them or do anything of that nature.;On the first part of your question, this information that 40 percent are considered political refugees, I'd like to see the documentation of that because our program says the law will apply. Political refugees have access to asylum.;What I don't want to do is to see these merchants of death, these guys that rent these leaky boats or build them, then sell passage to poor people, who offer them the hope of coming to America, and then have a rescue operation -- some of them not rescued -- at sea. We had a program to screen these people in Haiti. I must have different information than you, but I've got pretty good information as President of the United States that these people are not being persecuted when they go to file their claims for asylum. So we've got a factual difference there.;Q. In the Embassy, a case has come to our attention -- it's not the first one -- of a man who applied in June at the Embassy, 3 months later they invited him for an interview, but he'd been dead 9 days. Earlier a man's toenails had been ripped out. There are 11,000 people that your own asylum officers in Guantanamo, for 6 months before June, said had credible fears of persecution in Haiti, and they'd been allowed to come here and ask for asylum. But now you send everybody back.;The President. That's exactly my point. If they find cases like that, they're allowed to apply.;Q. But now you're sending them back with no asylum interviews whatsoever, right to the docks to get fingerprinted by the Haitian military.;The President. But I am told that when they go back there, there is not this persecution. You've raised it, let me take a look at it.;Aristide going back, we support that. I've got to be a little careful as President on what I say about him and how it works and what he's doing here. Our policy has been to support the OAS, the Organization of American States, to get this man back, not because of a great love for any individual but because of a commitment to democracy. I don't like to see democracy aborted by a coup. It isn't working too well because you don't have the public support that he once had. But we're going to stay with that for a while. But shutting down the oil is not that easy either. You ask the naval people about that.;Mr. Wills. Mr. President, I hate to stop this discussion -- --;The President. Kind of interesting debate, though.;Mr. Wills. -- -- but I've got to move on to Tampa-St. Petersburg for our next question, sir.;The Character Issue;Q. Good evening, Mr. President. I wanted to find out from you what is the goals of your administration for the next 5 years? And also, I am a person who served in the military, and my father served before me, and I want to find out your thoughts on the integrity of the person who will serve in the White House?;The President. The goals are restore economic prosperity to this country. That is the single overriding goal. As Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, as custodian of the national security, I've got to guarantee against threats to the United States or threats to the free world, really, and I take that responsibility very, very seriously.;In terms of the next person to serve there, I have had differences with Governor Clinton. And some say to me, "You're old-fashioned. I find it difficult to understand how the Commander in Chief reacts," taking the position that he did, that it's okay to organize demonstrations against your country when your country is at war in a foreign land. People say, "What's the difference in a foreign land?" I don't know. I make a distinction. If you want to protest, come to the White House and do it. That's the American way. Everybody else does. Why don't you come along and do that? But I have big differences.;But my differences with Governor Clinton in terms of the custodianship of the -- or the being Commander in Chief is the problem that he has with kind of coming down on one position. On the war he said, "I agree with the minority, but I guess I would have voted for the majority." You can't do that in the Oval Office. You have to make a decision. And sometimes it's painful, and you'll make a mistake and you say, "Look, I fouled that up. I made a mistake.;But on the war, we did the right thing, and I thought his position was waffling around out there. So I can't pass judgment on how anybody else would behave. But I've tried to uphold the honor. Honor, duty and country: I believe in that. I believe in service to country. And I think I'm a better Commander in Chief because I fought for my country. I don't think it's a mandatory requirement, but I just think it's made me more sensitive when you have to commit somebody else's son or someone's daughter to combat, having been there.;Mr. Wills. Mr. President, we've run out of time. Thank you so much for being here with us tonight.;That was our last question. We know there are so many others. We'd like to get them all in, but we have used up all of our time. We hope that the Florida News Network, through their town meetings, has helped you make an informed choice on November 3d.;Ms. Bishop. I'm sure last month you saw Governor Clinton on our town meeting, and the Florida News Network has issued an invitation to Ross Perot. We are waiting for his response. We thank all of you for joining us on television. Thank you here in our studio and our other studios around the State.;And of course, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us.;The President. Thank you all very, very much.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks at the Memorial Mass for Robert F. Kennedy in Arlington, Virginia</td><td class="c6">June 6, 1993</td><td class="c7">Father Creedon, Mrs. Kennedy, the children of Robert Kennedy, and the Kennedy family, to all the distinguished Americans here present, and most of all, to all of you who bear the noble title, citizen of this country: Twenty-five years ago today, on the eve of my college graduation, I cheered the victory of Robert Kennedy in the California primary and felt again that our country might face its problems openly, meet its challenges bravely, and go forward together. He dared us all. He dared the grieving not to retreat into despair. He dared the comfortable not to be complacent. He dared the doubting to keep going.;As I looked around this crowd today and saw us all graced not only by the laughter of children but by the tears of those of us old enough to remember, it struck me again that the memory of Robert Kennedy is so powerful that in a profound way we are all in two places today. We are here and now, and we are there, then.;For in Robert Kennedy we all invested our hopes and our dreams that somehow we might redeem the promise of the America we then feared we were losing, somehow we might call back the promise of President Kennedy and Martin Luther King and heal the divisions of Vietnam and the violence and pain in our own country. But I believe if Robert Kennedy were here today, he would dare us not to mourn his passing but to fulfill his promise and to be the people that he so badly wanted us all to be. He would dare us to leave yesterday and embrace tomorrow.;We remember him, almost captured in freeze-frame, standing on the hood of a car, grasping at outreached hands, black and brown and white. His promise was that the hands which reached out to him might someday actually reach out to each other. And together, those hands could make America everything that it ought to be, a nation reunited with itself and rededicated to its best ideals.;When his funeral train passed through the gritty cities of the Northeast, people from both sides of the tracks stood silent. He had earned their respect because he went to places most leaders never visit and listened to people most leaders never hear and spoke simple truth most leaders never speak.;He spoke out against neglect, but he challenged the neglected to seize their own destiny. He wanted so badly for Government to act, but he did not trust bureaucracy. And he believed that Government had to do things with people, not for them. He knew we had to do things together or not at all. He spoke to the sons and daughters of immigrants and the sons and daughters of sharecroppers and told them all, "As long as you stay apart from each other, you will never be what you ought to be.;He saw the word not in terms of right and left but right and wrong. And he taught us lessons that cannot be labeled except as powerful proof. Robert Kennedy reminded us that on any day, in any place, at any time, racism is wrong, exploitation is wrong, violence is wrong, anything that denies the simple humanity and potential of any man or woman is wrong.;He touched children whose stomachs were swollen with hunger but whose eyes still sparkled with life. He marched with workers who strained their backs for poverty wages while harvesting our food. He walked down city streets with people who ached, not from work but from the lack of it. Then as now, his piercing eyes and urgent voice speak of the things we all like to think that we believe in.;When he was alive, some said he was ruthless. Some said he wasn't a real liberal, and others claimed he was a real radical. If he were here today, I think he would laugh and say they were both right. But now as we see him more clearly, we understand he was a man who was very gentle to those who were most vulnerable, very tough in the standards he kept for himself, very old-fashioned in the virtues in which he believed, and a relentless searcher for change, for growth, for the potential of heart and mind that he sought in himself and he demanded of others.;Robert Kennedy understood that the real purpose of leadership is to bring out the best in others. He believed the destiny of our Nation is the sum total of all the decisions that all of us make. He often said that one person can make a difference, and each of us must try.;Some still believe we lost what is best about America when President Kennedy and Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed. But I ask you to remember, my fellow Americans, that Robert Kennedy did not lose his faith when his own brother was killed. And when Martin Luther King was killed, he gave from his heart what was perhaps his finest speech. He lifted himself from despair time after time and went back to work.;If you listen now you can hear with me his voice telling me and telling you and telling everyone here, "We can do better." Today's troubles call us to do better. The legacy of Robert Kennedy is a stem rebuke to the cynicism, to the trivialization that grips so much of our public life today. What use is it in the face of the aching problems gripping millions of Americans, the American without a job, the American without health care, the American without a safe street to live on or a good school to send a child to? What use is it in the face of all the divisions that keep our country down and rob our children of their rightful future?;Let us learn here once again the simple, powerful, beautiful lesson, the simple faith of Robert Kennedy: We can do better. Let us leave here no longer in two places, but once again in one only: in the here and now, with a commitment to tomorrow, the only part of our time that we can control. Let us embrace the memory of Robert Kennedy by living as he would have us to live. For the sake of his memory, of ourselves, and of all of our children and all those to come, let us believe again, we can do better.</td></tr>

Clinton: Message to the Congress Reporting on the National Emergency With Respect to Haiti</td><td class="c6">April 25, 1994</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;1. In December 1990, the Haitian people elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President by an overwhelming margin in a free and fair election. The United States praised Haiti's success in peacefully implementing its democratic constitutional system and provided significant political and economic support to the new government. The Haitian military abruptly interrupted the consolidation of Haiti's new democracy when in September 1991, it illegally and violently ousted President Aristide from office and drove him into exile.;2. The United States, on its own and with the Organization of American States (OAS), immediately imposed sanctions against the illegal regime. The United States has also actively supported the efforts of the OAS and the United Nations to restore democracy to Haiti and to bring about President Aristide's return by encouraging and facilitating a political process involving all the legitimate Haitian parties. The United States and the international community also offered material assistance within the context of an eventual settlement of the Haitian crisis to support the return to democracy, build constitutional structures, and foster economic well-being.;In furtherance of these twin objectives—restoration of constitutional democracy and fostering economic recovery—as discussed in section 10 below, the United States has taken additional measures to block the U.S.-located assets of persons (civilian as well as military) whose conduct, or material or financial support, has assisted the illegal maintenance of the illegitimate regime in Haiti, including persons obstructing the U.N. Mission in Haiti or the implementation of the Governors Island Agreement, and persons perpetuating or contributing to the violence in Haiti. In addition, in an effort to stabilize employment and minimize economic hardship for the local populace in Haiti, U.S. persons currently licensed to deal with the vital Haitian assembly sector have received reauthorization through May 31, 1994.;3. This report is submitted to the Congress pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c), and discusses Administration actions and expenses since my last report (November 13, 1993) that are directly related to the national emergency with respect to Haiti declared in Executive Order No. 12775, as implemented pursuant to that order and Executive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, and 12872.;4. Economic sanctions against the de facto regime in Haiti were first imposed in October 1991. On October 4, 1991, in Executive Order No. 12775, President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by events that had occurred in Haiti to disrupt the legitimate exercise of power by the democratically elected government of that country (56 Fed. Reg. 50641). In that order, the President ordered the immediate blocking of all property and interests in property of the Government of Haiti (including the Banque de la Republique d'Haiti) then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of a U.S. person, including its overseas branches. The Executive order also prohibited any direct or indirect payments or transfers to the de facto regime in Haiti of funds or other financial or investment assets or credits by any U.S. person, including its overseas branches, or by any entity organized under the laws of Haiti and owned or controlled by a U.S. person.;Subsequently, on October 28, 1991, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12779, adding trade sanctions against Haiti to the sanctions imposed on October 4 (56 Fed. Reg. 55975). This order prohibited exportation from the United States of goods, technology, services, and importation into the United States of Haitianorigin goods and services, after November 5, 1991, with certain limited exceptions. The order exempted trade in publications and other informational materials from the import, export, and payment prohibitions and permitted the exportation to Haiti of donations to relieve human suffering as well as commercial sales of five food commodities: rice, beans, sugar, wheat flour, and cooking oil. In order to permit the return to the United States of goods being prepared for U.S. customers by Haiti's substantial "assembly sector," the order also permitted, through December 5, 1991, the importation into the United States of goods assembled or processed in Haiti that contained parts or materials previously exported to Haiti from the United States. On February 5, 1992, it was announced that specific licenses could be applied for on a case-by-case basis by U.S. persons wishing to resume a preembargo import/export relationship with the assembly sector in Haiti.;5. On June 30, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12853 that expanded the blocking of assets of the de facto regime to include assets of Haitian nationals identified by the Secretary of the Treasury as providing substantial financial or material contributions to the regime, or doing substantial business with the regime. That Executive order also implemented United Nations Security Council Resolution ("UNSC Resolution") 841 of June 16, 1993, by prohibiting the sale or supply by U.S. persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of petroleum or petroleum products or arms and related materiel of all types to any person or entity in Haiti, or for the purpose of any business carried on in or operated from Haiti, or promoting or calculated to promote such sale or supply. Carriage of such goods to Haiti on U.S.-registered vessels is prohibited, as is any transaction for the evasion or avoidance of, or attempt to evade or avoid, any prohibition in the order.;6. As noted in my previous report, apparent steady progress toward achieving the firm goal of restoring democracy in Haiti permitted the United States and the world community to suspend economic sanctions against Haiti in August 1993. With strong support from the United States, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 861 on August 27, 1993, suspending the petroleum, arms, and financial sanctions imposed under UNSC Resolution 841. On the same day, the Secretary General of the OAS announced that the OAS was urging member states to suspend their trade embargoes. In concert with these U.N. and OAS actions, U.S. trade and financial restrictions against Haiti were suspended, effective at 9:35 a.m. e.d.t., on August 31, 1993.;These steps demonstrated my determination and that of the international community to see that Haiti and the Haitian people resume their rightful place in our hemispheric community of democracies. Our work to reach a solution to the Haitian crisis through the Governors Island Agreement was however seriously threatened by accelerating violence in Haiti sponsored or tolerated by the de facto regime. The violence culminated on October 11, 1993, with the obstruction by armed "attaches," supported by the Haitian military and police, of the deployment of U.S. military trainers and engineers sent to Haiti as part of the United Nations Mission in Haiti. The Haitian military's decision to dishonor its commitments made in the Governors Island Agreement was apparent. On October 13, 1993, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 873, which terminated the suspension of sanctions effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., October 18, 1993.;As a result, effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., October 18, 1993, the Department of the Treasury revoked the suspension of those trade and financial sanctions that had been suspended, so that the full scope of prior prohibitions was reinstated (58 Fed. Reg. 54024, October 19, 1993). In addition to the actions I took in Executive Order No. 12853, the reinstated sanctions in the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 580 (the "HTR"), prohibit most unlicensed trade with Haiti, and block the assets of the de facto regime in Haiti and the Government of Haiti. Restrictions on the entry into U.S. ports of vessels whose Haitian calls would violate U.S. or OAS sanctions had they been made by U.S. persons were also reinstated.;Also effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., October 18, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12872 (58 Fed. Reg. 54029), authorizing the Department of the Treasury to block assets of persons who have: (1) contributed to the obstruction of UNSC resolutions 841 and 873, the Governors Island Agreement, or the activities of the U.N. Mission in Haiti, (2) perpetuated or contributed to the violence in Haiti, or (3) materially or financially supported either the obstruction or the violence referred to above. This authority is in addition to the blocking authority provided for in the original sanctions and in Executive Order No. 12853 of June 30, 1993, and ensures adequate authority to reach assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction of military and police officials, civilian "attaches" and their financial patrons meeting these criteria. A list of 41 such individuals was published on November 1, 1993, by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) of the Department of the Treasury (58 Fed. Reg. 58480).;On October 18, I ordered the deployment of six U.S. Navy vessels off Haiti's shores. To improve compliance with the ban on petroleum and munitions shipments to Haiti contained in UNSC resolutions 841 and 873, my Administration succeeded in securing the passage of UNSC Resolution No. 875. UNSC Resolution 875 calls upon the United Nations Member States acting either nationally or through regional agencies or arrangements to halt inward maritime shipping for Haiti in order to inspect and verify that the Haiti-bound cargo does not contain UNSC-prohibited petroleum or arms. A multinational Maritime Interdiction Force that includes elements of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard has been established and now patrols the waters off Haiti.;7. The declaration of the national emergency on October 4, 1991, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the Congress on October 4, 1991, pursuant to section 204(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)). The additional sanctions set forth in Executive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, and 12872, were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, as well as the United Nations Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c), and represent the response by the United States to the United Nations Security Council and OAS directives and recommendations discussed above.;8. Since my report of November 13, 1993, FAC, in consultation with the Department of State and other Federal agencies, has issued General Notice No. 3, "Notification of Blocked Individuals of Haiti." The Notice, issued January 27, 1994, identifies 523 officers of the Haitian Armed Forces who have been determined by the Department of the Treasury to be Blocked Individuals of Haiti. General Notice No. 4, issued April 4, 1994, identifies an additional 27 individual officers of the Haitian Armed Forces and one civilian who have been determined by the Department of the Treasury to be Blocked Individuals of Haiti. These are persons who are members of the de facto regime or are blocked pursuant to Executive Orders Nos. 12853 or 12872. (A comprehensive list of Blocked Individuals of Haiti was published on April 7, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 16548)).;U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with these individuals and with all officers of the Haitian military (as members of the de facto regime), whether or not named in General Notice No. 3 or No. 4, unless the transactions are licensed by FAC. Additionally, all interests in property of these individuals that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked. U.S. persons are not prohibited, however, from paying funds owed to these entities or individuals into the appropriate blocked account in domestic U.S. financial institutions. Copies of the comprehensive list and of General Notices No. 3 and No. 4 are attached.;A policy statement, effective January 31, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 8134, February 18, 1994), was published to extend until March 31, 1994, the expiration date for all current assembly sector licenses issued by FAC pursuant to the HTR, and a second policy notice, effective March 29, 1994, was published on April 1, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 15342), extending these licenses through May 31, 1994. These licenses have provided an exception to the comprehensive U.S. trade embargo on Haiti under which the "assembly sector" has continued to receive parts and supplies from, and supply finished products to, persons in the United States. Copies of the policy statements are attached.;Assembly sector trade with the United States accounted for a significant portion of Haiti's imports, and a substantial majority of its exports, prior to the institution of the OAS-requested embargo in November 1991. Although initially suspended due to the embargo, assembly sector imports from and exports to the United States were allowed to resume on a case-by-case basis beginning in February 1992 in order to keep poorer segments of the Haitian population employed and to reduce their incentive to attempt illegal and dangerous immigration by sea to the United States and other countries. However, the continuing uncertainties of the Haitian situation have led to a sharp decline in assembly sector activity, where employment is now estimated to be no more than 10 percent of pre-embargo levels.;9. In implementing the Haitian sanctions program, FAC has made extensive use of its authority to specifically license transactions with respect to Haiti in an effort to mitigate the effects of the sanctions on the legitimate Government of Haiti and on the livelihood of Haitian workers employed by Haiti's assembly sector, and to ensure the availability of necessary medicines and medical supplies and the undisrupted flow of humanitarian donations to Haiti's poor. For example, specific licenses were issued: (1) permitting expenditures from blocked assets for the operations of the legitimate Government of Haiti, (2) permitting U.S. firms with pre-embargo relationships with product assembly operations in Haiti to resume those relationships in order to continue employment for their workers or, if they choose to withdraw from Haiti, to return to the United States assembly equipment, machinery, and parts and materials previously exported to Haiti, (3) permitting U.S. companies operating in Haiti to establish, under specified circumstances, interest-bearing blocked reserve accounts in commercial or investment banking institutions in the United States for deposit of amounts owed the de facto regime, (4) permitting the continued material support of U.S. and international religious, charitable, public health, and other humanitarian organizations and projects operating in Haiti, (5) authorizing commercial sales of agricultural inputs such as fertilizer and foodcrop seeds, and (6) in order to combat deforestation, permitting the importation of agricultural products grown on trees.;10. During this reporting period, U.S.-led OAS initiatives resulted in even greater intensification and coordination of enforcement activities. Continued close coordination with the U.S. Customs Service in Miami sharply reduced the number of attempted exports of unmanifested, unauthorized merchandise. New FAC initiatives are expected to result in more effective coordination of Customs Service and Department of Justice activities in prosecution of embargo violations. During the reporting period, the multinational Maritime Interdiction Force that contains elements of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, continued to patrol offshore Haiti and to conduct ship boardings, inspections of cargoes bound for Haiti, identification of suspected violators, and referrals for investigation. The Maritime Interdiction Force has boarded 612 ships and diverted 38 of these ships for various reasons (inaccessibility of cargo for inspection, items prohibited by the United Nations Security Council embargo on board) from its inception to March 30, 1994. Actions have been taken to counter embargo violations as they have developed. There have been high-level discussions with the Government of the Dominican Republic to encourage its stated desire to cooperate with the United Nations in increasing the effectiveness of the enforcement of the sanctions on that country's common border with Haiti across which fuel smuggling is occurring. Other steps have been taken to control sales of bunker fuel by ships in Haitian ports and smuggling of fuel in Haitian- Dominican coastal waters.;The Department of the Treasury, in close coordination with Department of State and the intelligence community, continues to designate "Blocked Individuals of Haiti," blocking the assets of persons (civilian as well as military) whose conduct meets the criteria of Executive Orders Nos. 12755, 12853, and 12872, including persons obstructing the U.N. Mission in Haiti or the implementation of the Governors Island Agreement and persons perpetuating or contributing to the violence in Haiti. The list was last expanded on January 27, when the entire officer corps of the Haitian Armed Forces was blocked as part of the de facto regime in Haiti, and on April 4, when one additional civilian was added to the list. As others subverting democracy in Haiti and additional members of the officer corps are identified by name, these names will be incorporated into the list of "Blocked Individuals of Haiti.;Since the last report, 35 penalties, totaling in excess of $146,000, have been collected from U.S. businesses and individuals for violations of the Regulations. Eighteen violations involved unlicensed import- and export-related activity. As of March 4, 1994, 12 payments of penalties assessed against the masters of vessels for unauthorized trade transactions or violations of entry restrictions totalled about $53,000. A significant penalty collection during the reporting period was from American Airlines for its direct payments of taxes and fees to the de facto regime in Haiti.;11. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from October 4, 1993, through April 3, 1994, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Haiti are estimated at about $3.4 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department of State, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Department of Commerce.;12. I am committed to the restoration of democracy in Haiti and determined to see that Haiti and the Haitian people resume their rightful place in our hemispheric community of democracies. Active U.S. support for United Nations/OAS efforts to resolve the Haitian crisis has led to the maintenance and enforcement of sweeping economic sanctions. Our diplomatic efforts complementing these sanctions are designed to encourage and facilitate participation by all legitimate Haitian political elements in a broad-based political process that will bring about the fulfillment of the undertakings they made in the Governors Island Agreement so that Haitian democracy can be restored and President Aristide can return to Haiti. Such a political process will enable the lifting of sanctions and the start of Haiti's economic reconstruction and national reconciliation. The United States will continue to play a leadership role in the international community's program of support and assistance for the restoration of democracy and return of President Aristide to Haiti.;I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant developments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).;WILLIAM J. CLINTON;The White House, April 25, 1994.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks Announcing the Appointment of William H. Gray III as Special Adviser on Haiti and an Exchange With Reporters</td><td class="c6">May 8, 1994</td><td class="c7">The President. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I want to speak for a few moments about the crisis in Haiti, the challenge it poses to our national interests, and the new steps I am taking to respond.;Three and a half years ago, in free and fair elections, the people of Haiti chose Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President. Just 9 months later, their hopes were dashed when Haiti's military leaders overthrew democracy by force. Since then, the military has murdered innocent civilians, crushed political freedom, and plundered Haiti's economy.;From the start of this administration, my goal has been to restore democracy and President Aristide. Last year, we helped the parties to negotiate the Governors Island accord, a fair and balanced agreement which laid out a road map for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. But late last year, the Haitian military abrogated the agreement, and since then they have rejected every effort to achieve a political settlement.;At the same time, the repression and bloodshed in Haiti have reached alarming new proportions. Supporters of President Aristide, and many other Haitians, are being killed and mutilated. This is why 6 weeks ago I ordered a review of our policy toward Haiti. As a result of this review, we are taking several steps to increase pressure on Haiti's military while addressing the suffering caused by their brutal misrule. We are stepping up our diplomatic efforts, we are intensifying sanctions, and we are adapting our migration policy.;Let me describe these steps. First, to bring new vigor to our diplomacy, I am pleased to announce that Bill Gray, president of the United Negro College Fund, former House majority whip, and chair of the House Budget Committee, has accepted my invitation to serve as special adviser to me and to the Secretary of State on Haiti. Bill is here with his wife, on his way to the inauguration of President Mandela in South Africa, and I will ask him to speak in just a few moments. But let me just say that he is a man of vision and determination, of real strength and real creativity. And I appreciate his willingness to accept this difficult and challenging assignment. He will be the point man in our diplomacy and a central figure in our future policy deliberations.;As part of our diplomatic efforts, we will work with the United Nations to examine the changes in the proposed U.N. military and police mission in Haiti. We want to ensure that once Haiti's military leaders have left, this mission can do its job effectively and safely.;Second, the U.S. is leading the international community in a drive to impose tougher sanctions on Haiti. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution we had proposed to tighten sanctions on everything but humanitarian supplies, to prevent Haiti's military leaders and their civilian allies from leaving the country, to promote a freeze of their assets worldwide, and to ban nonscheduled flights in and out of Haiti. U.S. naval vessels will continue to enforce these sanctions vigorously.;We are also working with the Dominican Republic to improve sanctions enforcement along that nation's border with Haiti. To shield the most vulnerable Haitians from the worst effects of the sanctions, we will increase both humanitarian aid and the number of U.N. and OAS human rights monitors in Haiti.;While these stronger sanctions will cause more hardships for innocent Haitians, we must be clear: The military leaders bear full responsibility for this action. They can stop the suffering of their people by giving up power, as they themselves agreed to do, and allowing the restoration of democracy and the return of President Aristide.;Third, I am announcing certain changes in our migration policy toward Haiti. Currently, Haitians seeking refugee status, including those interdicted at sea, are interviewed only in Haiti and not beyond its shores. Our processing centers, which have been dramatically expanded in this administration, are doing a good job under bad circumstances.;In 1993, we processed and approved about 10 times the number of refugee applicants as in 1992. In recent months, however, I have become increasingly concerned that Haiti's declining human rights situation may endanger the safety of those who have valid fears of political persecution, who flee by boat, and who are then returned to Haiti where they are met at the docks by Haitian authorities before they can be referred to in-country processing.;Therefore, I have decided to modify our procedures. We will continue to interdict all Haitian migrants at sea, but we will determine aboard ship or in other countries, which ones are bona fide political refugees. Those who are not will still be returned to Haiti, but those who are will be provided refuge. We will also approach other countries to seek their participation in this humanitarian endeavor.;The new procedures will begin once we have the necessary arrangements in place. This will take some weeks. Until then, the Haitians must understand that we will continue to return all boat migrants to Haiti. Even under the new procedures, there will be no advantage for Haitians with fears of persecution to risk their lives at sea if and when they can assert their claims more safely at a processing center in Haiti.;The ultimate solution to this crisis, however, is for the military leaders to keep their own commitment to leave, so that Haiti's people can build a peaceful and prosperous future in their own country.;I am committed to making these new international sanctions work. At the same time, I cannot and should not rule out other options. The United States has clear interests at stake in ending this crisis. We have an interest in bolstering the cause of democracy in the Americas. We have an interest in ensuring the security of our citizens living and working in Haiti. We have an interest in stopping the gross human rights violations and abuses of the military and their accomplices. And we clearly have a humanitarian interest in preventing a massive and dangerous exodus of Haitians by sea.;The steps I have announced today are designed to relieve suffering, redouble pressure, and restore democracy. Working with the Haitian people and the world community, we will try to advance our interests and give Haiti an opportunity to build a future of freedom and hope. They voted for it, and they deserve the chance to have it.;Mr. Gray.;[ At this point, Mr. Gray made brief remarks. ];Q. Mr. President, what makes you believe that these sanctions, these new policies on returning Haitian refugees to Haiti will work this time? Haven't they been tried before and found to be unreliable or to encourage people to——;The President. Before, when they were tried, the circumstances were somewhat different.;First of all, let me answer the question about why we would undertake to change the policy, even though there is clearly some logistical challenge involved in doing so.;I ordered the review of this policy 6 weeks ago when we began first to get intelligence reports and then clear news reports that there was increasing violence against citizens of Haiti who did not agree with the policies of the military regime—and indeed, some of them seem to not be political at all—of people not only being killed but being mutilated. It seems to me reasonable to assume that some of the people who are fleeing by boat are in that group of people who also are fearful of their lives. And the way the boat return has worked so far is that we take the people back, let them off at the dock at Port-au-Prince. They are then—by and large, they have been free to go to the in-country processing. But they are subject to the authority of the Haitian police at that moment. And I simply think that the risks of that cannot be justified, given the increased level of political violence in the country. Therefore, I think we have to change the policy.;Now, why do I think it will work? First, we've studied what happened before when the policy of inspection of people at sea occurred, and we have determined that two things ought to be done. First, we ought to look for a thirdcountry processing center. And second, if we do it at sea, we ought not to do it on the Coast Guard cutters, which can be quickly overrun in their capacity, but to do it on bigger ships.;We believe if—given a little time to organize this logistically, we can handle it. Also, it will be clear that we are not changing our policy, which is the law of the United States with regard to economic refugees. People who seek to come to the United States for economic reasons only, are not eligible for this kind of status.;So we will do these reviews. We think we can do them fairly quickly, in a matter of a few days, and then return those who should be returned and take those who should be taken into the United States.;Ron [Ron Fournier, Associated Press].;Q. Are you in danger, sir, of sending signals that could open the floodgates for Haitian refugees? And how much, if any, did the fast play into your decisionmaking process?;The President. First, let me answer your first question. I hope that we will not have a flood of refugees, but we are increasing our naval resources to deal with them. We are not changing our policy about who can come and who cannot. That is a matter of American law. We are not able to do that, nor should we do that.;But I don't believe the policy we have now is sustainable, given the level of political violence against innocent civilians in Haiti. We have to try to implement this policy. I believe we can, and I think, as we do it firmly, the Haitian people will see we are not opening the floodgates for indiscriminate refugee migration into the United States but that we are going to try to find those people who have left because they have a genuine fear.;The review of this policy began before Mr. Robinson's fast, but if you will go back, and when I was first asked about it I said that I did not mind his criticism of our policy, it obviously had not worked. I said that from day one. And I respect his conviction and his courage and his conscience. And I was gratified by the comments that he said today. And I'm glad that on this Mother's Day he's going to be having dinner with his wife tonight.;Q. Mr. President, on sanctions, your former envoy to Haiti warns that the stricter sanctions will—could also ruin the situation on the ground in Haiti. It would make it impossible for President Aristide or for anyone Mr. Gray works with to set up there to bring democracy back. What kind of confidence do you have that economic sanctions are going to bring the military leaders out?;The President. Well, I think the economic sanctions will have to be coupled with a vigorous and aggressive and broad-based diplomatic effort. And we are exploring all alternatives.;As you know, we have been reluctant to impose the more severe sanctions, although President Aristide and many of the Friends of Haiti group, the French, the Canadians, others who have worked with us on this for a long time, since, have advocated this course. In my view, we must exhaust all available alternatives as we try to resolve this diplomatically. And I think it is an appropriate thing to do now.;If we are successful in trying to bring back democracy and to restore not only President Aristide but the concept, the spirit that was in the Governors Island accord, that is, a broadbased, functioning representative government that can relate to the business community as well as to the ordinary citizens of Haiti, then we will have to get ourselves in gear to try to make sure that that economy comes back as quickly as possible. We're trying to do that with South Africa and others. I think we'll be able to do it.;Q. Mr. President, I don't understand why the administration is saying that it does not expect a large influx of Haitian refugees now. Are you saying effectively that you expect the results of the new policy will be the same as the results of the old policy?;The President. No, I'm saying—I think there will be more—some more people in the sense that we will be reviewing more people simultaneously. That is, we will be reviewing people not only in the in-country processing centers, but we'll be interviewing people either on boats or in a third country. But what I'm saying is that we have not broadened the criteria of eligibility for coming to the United States.;I want to make this very clear. The problem with the present policy is—the present policy worked in 1993 up through the abrogation of the Governors Island accord and for some time thereafter in the sense that we did not have evidence of widespread indiscriminate killing of civilians. And we increased by tenfold, by tenfold, the number of people processed and the number of people approved for refuge in this country for 1993 over 1992.;But when all this killing started, when it became obvious that the military leaders had no earthly intention of honoring Governors Island or anything approaching it or keeping their commitments, but instead were going to tolerate, organize, and abet increased killing in Haiti, it is logical to assume that some of those who get on the boats include not only economic refugees, who are the vast majority of them, but also some who genuinely fear for their lives. The only way we can get those people to the in-country processing is to let them off at the dock in Port-au-Prince where the police have jurisdiction. I do not believe that is a sustainable policy, either practically or morally, given the level of indiscriminate violence.;So there may be some more people who get in because we'll be reviewing even more people. But it would be a great mistake for Haitians who want to come here for economic reasons to just take to the boats, because we are not changing the standard by which we admit people.;Gwen [Gwen Ifill, New York Times].;Q. It seems there are two outstanding problems. One is that Lieutenant General Cedras said this morning he doesn't really have any intention of stepping aside in order to replace— in order to make room for President Aristide, and that even your supporters on this policy are concerned that there is still no equivalency between what happens with the United States and Cuban immigrants and the United States and Haitian immigrants. How do you address those two things?;The President. Well, I think we are going to have—we do have an equivalency in terms of people who get here. But we have an obligation to try to let the people who genuinely fear for their lives into this country. We are now going to do that without regard to whether they're processed in-country or on boats. Therefore, the legal standard is what it ought to be.;The Cuban situation is unique in the sense that there is an act of Congress which has certain specifics about the Cuban situation which changes our relationship with Cuba to some extent. But this will alleviate the legitimate concern with regard to the Haitians, and I hope will minimize the likelihood that hundreds of people will die at sea innocently.;Q. And about Lieutenant General Cedras?;The President. Well, of course, he's going to say that. That's what he's been saying ever since—that's what he told us when he abrogated the Governors Island accord. "I gave my word. I never expect President Aristide to keep his word. President Aristide called my bluff, kept his word, and so I'm going to shaft the agreement." That's what he said on September 30th. So he hasn't changed his mind since then. But we may be able to do better now. And I think the gentleman to my right is a person of extraordinary ability, maybe he can do some things we haven't done yet. We're going to give it our best shot.;[ At this point, a Cuban-American expressed appreciation for the new policy on Haiti. ];The President. Thanks.;One more.;Q. How long are you willing to give sanctions to take the desired effect?;The President. I think I have to let Mr. Gray do a little work before I can answer that question.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks Announcing Additional Economic Sanctions Against Haiti</td><td class="c6">June 10, 1994</td><td class="c7">Good afternoon. Today I want to have Bill Gray, our Special Adviser on Haiti, announce two new steps that are necessary to intensify the pressure on that country's military leaders, a ban on commercial air traffic and sanctions on financial transactions.;As Bill Gray will explain, these steps represent an important new stage in our efforts to restore democracy and return President Aristide to Haiti. The message is simple: Democracy must be restored, the coup must not endure.;In the past month, we have taken steps to advance the interests of the Haitian people and the United States. Our national interests, to help democracy thrive in this hemisphere and to protect the lives of thousands of Americans who live and work in Haiti, require us to strengthen these efforts.;Under our leadership, comprehensive United Nations trade sanctions have gone into force. To enforce these sanctions, we are moving to assist the Dominican Republic to seal its shared border with Haiti. The Dominican Republic has agreed to welcome a multilateral sanctions monitoring team to help the Dominican s seal their border.;We've deployed U.S. naval patrol boats to the area to stop smugglers and have begun detaining ships suspected of violating the sanctions. We've also made important strides in dealing with the difficult issue of Haitians who leave that country by sea. A facility to interview Haitians who have been interdicted will soon open in Jamaica. And one month from now, we will open a second interview facility on the Turks and Caicos Islands. I want to thank the governments of those countries and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees for their collaboration in this effort.;I want to be clear about this issue. I continue to urge all Haitians to avoid risking their lives in treacherous boat voyages. Anyone who fears persecution should apply for refugee status at our facilities within Haiti. Since our administration began, those offices have arranged resettlement for some 3,000 Haitian political refugees, far, far more than was the case prior to that time. They stand ready to review further cases and represent the safest and fastest way for Haitians to seek refuge.;Now I'd like to ask Bill Gray, who stepped into this very difficult role and has used great skill to make real progress, to explain these new steps which we're announcing today.</td></tr>

I'll say, "Well, I had to get Ted Turner up off the floor." [ Laughter ] "Didn't have much to do with public policy, couldn't stand to see a man with all that energy prone for the rest of his life. Seemed like an incalculable waste of human potential." [ Laughter ];Thank you. Thank you, Ted, and thank you, Jane. When I was down in Atlanta the other day to do the global press conference—which is one of the most exciting experiences I have had as the President or, indeed, in my entire public life, and I loved meeting all the journalists from around the world and trying to answer their questions and communicating with them— when it was over, I got a handwritten note from Jane Fonda that said, "Well, you did a pretty good job on that, but don't forget about population." [ Laughter ] It was more formal, more polite, but that is the distilled essence of the letter that I got. So for both of them, I thank them for being here, although I do believe being on a stream in Montana is a way of supporting sustainable development that all of us could appreciate.;I want to thank, also, Dr. Bruce Alberts and the staff at the National Academy of Sciences, the Shorenstein Barone Center of the Kennedy School, and the Pew Global Stewardship Initiative for this event. And I do want to say a special word of thanks to Tim Wirth. All of you who care passionately about this issue know how well he has done, what a great advocate he has been for bringing the world's attention to the kinds of challenges that will command all of us for decades to come. It's not always easy, and it's now almost become trite to say that anyone who wants to truly change things has to be willing to be misunderstood. And sometimes I think Tim is competing with me for first in line on that subject. [ Laughter ] But the country is in your debt, sir, and we thank you very much.;I've been trying to prepare to go to the G- 7 meeting in Naples. And I've been working on this organization for the last, well, year and a half—as long as I've been in office—to try to first get them to focus on global growth in the short run, about what we can do within our nations and together, and then to think about what the world will look like in the next century and what we must do. And I must tell you, I am of two minds. I am so happy and proud to be going there, basically to say that what we agreed to do is working, in the near term, it is clearly working.;The United States has 40 percent of the gross domestic product of the G-7. But in the last year, we've had 75 percent of the growth, almost 100 percent of the jobs, twice the investment rate, twice the export increase rate, the highest rate of productivity growth. We've got the second lowest deficit, next year we'll have the lowest deficit of all of the G-7 countries. These things are heartening to me. And as a group, our economy is in the best shape it's been in in 4 years. There is a sense that we're working together and that our Nation is fortunate enough to lead the way.;But when you look at the longrun trends that are going on around the world—you read articles like Robert Kaplan's article in the Atlantic a couple of months ago that some say it's too dour—still, if you really look at what is going on, you could visualize a world in which a few million of us live in such opulence we could all be starring on nighttime soaps and the rest of us look like we're in one of those Mel Gibson "Road Warrior" movies.;And I was so gripped by many things that were in that article and by the more academic treatment of the same subject by Professor Homer Dixon. And I keep trying to imagine what it's going to be like to bring children into this world in this country or that one or the other. That is really what we are forced to come to grips with. And when I think about it, my mind starts bursting in those ways that some people say are undisciplined, but I think are productive. [ Laughter ];If you look at the landscape of the future and you say, we have to strengthen the families of the globe, we have to encourage equitable and strong growth, we have to provide basic health care, we have to stop AIDS from spreading, we have to develop water supplies and improve agricultural yields and stem the flow of refugees and protect the environment, and on and on and on, it gives you a headache. And of course, on that list, you have to say, if you look at the numbers, you must reduce the rate of population growth.;Tim was talking about Haiti. My daughter and I once were talking about Haiti a few months ago, and I was telling her about how her mother and I had gone to Haiti once many years ago, shortly after we married, and what sadness and hope I had seen there at the same time, and what had happened since then. And she said to me, "I know all that, Dad, because I've seen aerial photographs from in space. And if you look at the island, you can see where the Dominican Republic ends and where Haiti begins. And there couldn't be that environmental destruction without all those other problems you talked about." It was a stunning thing from the perspective of an American schoolchild that sort of wraps all this up.;I say that to make this point: We have to be disciplined in saying, "Well, all right, how much time and how much money and how much energy have we got?" And we have to order our priorities. But we cannot be naive enough to think that it is so easy to isolate one of these issues as opposed to another, that there is some silver bullet that solves the future of the world.;If you look at the rate at which natural resources are disappearing and you look at the rate at which the gap between rich and poor is growing, if you look at the fact that the world's population has doubled since only 74 nations met in Rome 40 years ago, it is clear that we need a comprehensive approach to the world's future. We call it under the buzzword of "sustainable development," I guess, but there is no way that we can approach tomorrow unless we at least are mindful of our common responsibilities in all these areas.;During the 9 days of the upcoming Cairo conference, more than 2 million people will enter our world. More than 2 million new babies will be born into a world in which one-third of our children are already hungry, 2 of every 5 people on Earth lack basic sanitation, and large parts of the world exist with only one doctor for every 35,000 or 40,000 people. Reversing these policies will require innovation and commitment and a determination to do what can be done over a long period of time, while all of us around the world are busy with our own business within our borders. It will require us to be willing to think anew about the relationship of human development to what is going on in all of these nations, to cast aside a lot of our ideas in the past when it was always tempting to believe that there was one single thing we could do, some silver bullet, that would make everything all right.;To bring about shared prosperity, as Professor Homer Dixon has written, the nations of the world simply must move forward on many fronts at one time. Reducing population growth without providing economic opportunity won't work. Without education, it's hard to imagine how basic health care will ever take hold. Ignored, these challenges will continue to divide people from one another. We simply have to solve these problems together, both the problems together and together as the people of the world.;I'm really proud of the fact that the G-7 has agreed to address some of these issues in a serious way this week in Naples. We're going to talk about what we can do within the G- 7 to promote not just growth but more jobs, because a lot of the wealthy countries are finding they can't create jobs even when they grow their economy. And then, when they can't do that, they lose the constituency at home to engage the rest of the world.;We're going to talk about how we build an economic infrastructure for the 21st century. What's this new world trade organization that we create with GATT going to look like? And what should the World Bank and the IMF do? We're also going to talk about how we can help economies in transition, like the states of the former Soviet Union, and what we can do with the economies that are not in transition or, if anything, are going the wrong way, to address our common responsibilities.;This is quite a unique thing, really, for the world's advanced nations. And I'm quite pleased that, with all the economic problems that exist in many of these countries, they are willing to have a serious look at where we should be 10 or 20 years from now, far beyond the election prospects of all the world leaders who will be there.;As we head for the Cairo conference, I think that same approach has to guide us. The policies we promote must be based on enduring values, promoting stronger families, having more responsibility from individual citizens, respecting human rights, deepening the bonds of community. Here at home and around the globe, that's where the future lies, beginning with our families. When they're whole and they function, families nurture and care for us. They provide role models. They communicate values and enable people to live together in peace and to work together for common objectives. Therefore, that is the most important thing we can do.;Since the beginning of this administration, we have worked to promote policies that would permit families to grow in strength at home and abroad. I reversed the so-called Mexico City policy because I thought that doctors and medical workers around the world should be able to really work on family planning and provide a full range of family planning information.;Since then, we have increased by about 50 percent, at a very tough budget time, the Agency for International Development's budget for international family planning and support services. To bolster families here at home, we passed a big increase in the earned-income tax credit to help keep 15 million working families off welfare, out of poverty, and in the work force. We increased Head Start availability and nutrition programs to hundreds of thousands of children, cracked down on delinquent child support payments, increased immunization funds so that we can increase by literally more than a million the number of children who are immunized. We're working to reduce out-of-wedlock and teen births.;Through the Family and Medical Leave Act, we're working to make it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents, a big issue everywhere in the world now, where more and more parents must work. In any society which forces people to choose, we are doomed to failure. If people have no option to work and we all need people to continue to bear children, surely all of our parents must be successful workers, and our workers must be able to succeed as parents.;Our population policy is rooted in the idea that the family should be at the center of all of our objectives. Therefore, there must be a support for the concept of responsibility of parents to their children, of men and women to one another, and of our current generation to future generations.;Progress brings freedom, freedom requires more disciplined responsibility. And we must teach our young people to choose wisely and tell them that their choices must include abstinence. Our policy has always been rooted in the ethical principles of compassion and justice and respect for human rights. We have supported every individual's dignity and worth. And we will continue to oppose and to condemn all forms of coercion in family planning.;Helping to translate these principles into reality is the charge that the Vice President will take to Cairo in September. No one is better suited to this task than he is. He has shown his commitment to these long-term challenges, and he has been thinking in large ways about them long before they were politically popular or even the source of much current discussion.;In Cairo, we'll join the international community in pursuing a new plan of action to attack the population problem as part of the larger issue of sustainable development. At the top of our agenda will be active support for efforts to invest in the women of the world. Maybe over the long run, maybe the most important thing the Cairo policy will call for is that every nation make an effort to educate its children on an equal basis, to put an end to the widespread practice of withdrawing girls from school and forcing them to go to work before boys do. To ensure that nations can develop at a more rapid pace, it will call on each of us to recognize women's work and development and to engage them fully in the work force. It will help to give women the full rights of citizenship and to end discrimination which exists still nearly everywhere and slows progress wherever it exists.;At Cairo, the United States will also join the international community in launching new, highquality, voluntary family planning and reproductive health programs. Our goal is to make these programs available to every citizen in the world by early in the next century. Parents must have the right to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.;Now, I want to be clear about this. Contrary to some assertions, we do not support abortion as a method of family planning. We respect, however, the diversity of national laws, except we do oppose coercion wherever it exists. Our own policy in the United States is that this should be a matter of personal choice, not public dictation and, as I have said many times, that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. In other countries where it does exist, we believe safety is an important issue. And if you look at the mortality figures, it is hard to turn away from that issue. We also believe that providing women with the means to prevent unwanted pregnancy will do more than anything else to reduce abortion.;Finally, let me say, we must take to Cairo the same basic commitment to provide health care for every citizen of the world that we have brought to the public debate here in America. I must say that there is less disagreement among the representatives of the 174 countries going to Cairo than there is among the 535 Members of Congress. Maybe we can bring the spirit back home.;Experience shows that investing in maternal health, prenatal services, preventive care for children does not only save lives, it eventually gives people the confidence they need to know that their children will survive. And that changes all kinds of attitudes that affect the way children are raised. Every country has committed itself to improving the health of women and children. And every one that has really done that has seen a decline in population growth and a rise in prosperity.;The Cairo conference, therefore, can do a great deal to advance our vision of sustainable development and stabilized population growth, to help us fulfill a vision of a world of intact families in which every member is cherished, a world that has the wisdom and the strength to tackle challenges head on, instead of to talk about them and use words to divide people so they don't really address them, a world that will lead to equal opportunity and shared prosperity.;When President Roosevelt died in 1945, there was a typed manuscript of his last speech which was found with just a single sentence written in his own hand. This was the last sentence of the last speech that Franklin Roosevelt had written, one that he never got to give. His handwritten sentence said, "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith." In the face of so many seemingly intractable problems, it is certainly tempting to let those doubts take control. But I think those of you here tonight believe as I do that we can, instead, search for and find solutions that will help generations yet to come. President Roosevelt governed in a time when doubt was a luxury the American people could not afford.;I say to you tonight, doubt is a luxury the world can no longer afford.;I commend you for your compassion and your commitment. I urge you to turn this faith into action and to help me to do my job to do the same.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders Reporting on the National Emergency With Respect to Haiti</td><td class="c6">October 13, 1994</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr. Speaker: (Dear Mr. President:);1. In December 1990, the Haitian people elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President by an overwhelming margin in a free and fair election. The United States praised Haiti's success in peacefully implementing its democratic constitutional system and provided significant political and economic support to the new government. The Haitian military abruptly interrupted the consolidation of Haiti's new democracy when, in September 1991, it illegally and violently ousted President Aristide from office and drove him into exile.;2. The United States, on its own and together with the Organization of American States (OAS), immediately imposed sanctions against the illegal regime. The United States also actively supported the efforts of the OAS and the United Nations to restore democracy to Haiti and to bring about President Aristide's return by facilitating negotiations between the Haitian parties. The United States and the international community also offered material assistance within the context of an eventual negotiated settlement of the Haitian crisis to support the return to democracy, build constitutional structures, and foster economic well-being.;As a result of continuing military intransigence in the face of these efforts and of worsening human rights abuses in Haiti, the conclusion was reached that no political settlement of the Haitian crisis was possible as long as the three principal military leaders remained in power. Therefore, beginning in early May 1994, a series of steps were taken to intensify the pressure of sanctions on the military leaders and their associates in order to bring the three leaders to step down. With U.S. leadership, the U.N. Security Council on May 6, 1994, enacted Resolution 917, imposing comprehensive trade sanctions and other measures on Haiti. This was followed by a succession of unilateral United States sanctions—banning scheduled air service and financial transactions to or from Haiti or between Haiti and third countries through the United States and blocking the assets in the United States or under United States control of Haitians resident in Haiti. Additionally, under authorities not related to the IEEPA, all visas that had been issued to Haitians at Port-au-Prince or Curacao before May 11, 1994, were revoked. Several other countries took similar actions.;The continued resistance of the illegal regime to the efforts of the international community also prompted the United States to augment embargo enforcement. The United States and other countries entered into a cooperative endeavor with the Dominican Republic to monitor that country's enforcement of sanctions along its land border with Haiti and in its coastal waters.;As the reporting period progressed, it became apparent that the Haitian military leaders, even under the pressure of intense worldwide sanctions, were determined to cling to power and to block the restoration of democracy and return of President Aristide. Internal repression continued to worsen, exemplified by the expulsion in July of the U.N./OAS-sponsored International Civilian Mission (ICM) human rights observers. As a result of this deterioration and the threat it posed to peace and security in the region, the U.N. Security Council enacted Resolution 940 on July 31, 1994, authorizing the use of all necessary means to bring about the departure of the military leadership and the return of the legitimate authorities including President Aristide. In the succeeding weeks, the international community under U.S. leadership assembled a multinational coalition force to carry out this mandate.;On September 18, 1994, I directed the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces to Haiti to remove the military leaders and restore democracy. However, I remained deeply committed to achieving our goals peacefully if possible. Therefore, on the previous day I had sent former President Jimmy Carter, Senator Sam Nunn and retired General Colin Powell to Haiti on a final diplomatic mission. The combination of an imminent military operation and determined diplomacy led to an agreement on September 18, that portends the early achievement of our and the international community's goals in Haiti. The military leaders have relinquished power and the legitimate authorities will be restored by October 15 at the latest. As a result of the agreement reached in Port-au-Prince on September 18 U.S. forces in the vanguard of the multinational coalition force drawn from 26 countries began a peaceful deployment to Haiti on September 19.;In a spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction, President Aristide called on September 25 for the immediate easing of sanctions to further the mission of the coalition forces and begin without delay the work of rebuilding. In response to this request, on September 26, in an address before the United Nations General Assembly, I announced my intention to suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except those that affect the military leaders and their immediate supporters and families. I also directed that steps be taken in accordance with Resolutions 917 and 940 to permit supplies and services to flow to Haiti to restore health care, water and electrical services, provide construction materials for humanitarian programs, and allow the shipment of communications, agricultural, and educational materials.;Regulations to accomplish those objectives were published in the Federal Register on October 5. In addition, the U.N. Security Council on September 29 enacted Resolution 944 directing that all U.N. sanctions be terminated the day after President Aristide returns to Haiti. Finally, the national emergency with respect to Haiti was extended on September 30, 1994, to allow the continued enforcement of those sanctions that are to remain in force until the restoration of democracy to Haiti is completed as will be signified by President Aristide's return to his country.;3. This report is submitted to the Congress pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It is not a report on all U.S. activities with respect to Haiti, but discusses only those Administration actions and expenses since my last report (April 25, 1994), that are directly related to the national emergency with respect to Haiti declared in Executive Order No. 12775, as implemented pursuant to that order and Executive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, and 12922.;4. Economic sanctions against the de facto regime in Haiti were first imposed in October 1991. On October 4, 1991, in Executive Order No. 12775, President Bush declared a national emergency to deal with the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States caused by events that had occurred in Haiti to disrupt the legitimate exercise of power by the democratically-elected government of that country (56 Fed. Reg. 50641). In that order, the President ordered the immediate blocking of all property and interests in property of the Government of Haiti (including the Banque de la Republique d'Haiti) then or thereafter located in the United States or within the possession or control of a U.S. person, including its overseas branches. The Executive order also prohibited any direct or indirect payments or transfers to the de facto regime in Haiti of funds or other financial or investment assets or credits by any U.S. person, including its overseas branches, or by any entity organized under the laws of Haiti and owned or controlled by a U.S. person.;Subsequently, on October 28, 1991, President Bush issued Executive Order No. 12779, adding trade sanctions against Haiti to the sanctions imposed on October 4 (56 Fed. Reg. 55975). This order prohibited exportation from the United States of goods, technology, and services and importation into the United States of Haitian-origin goods and services, after November 5, 1991, with certain limited exceptions. The order exempted trade in publications and other informational materials from the import, export, and payment prohibitions and permitted the exportation to Haiti of donations to relieve human suffering as well as commercial sales of five food commodities: rice, beans, sugar, wheat flour and cooking oil. In order to permit the return to the United States of goods being prepared for U.S. customers by Haiti's substantial "assembly sector," the order also permitted, through December 5, 1991, the importation into the United States of goods assembled or processed in Haiti that contained parts or materials previously exported to Haiti from the United States. On February 5, 1992, it was announced that specific licenses could be applied for on a case-by-case basis by U.S. persons wishing to resume a preembargo import/export relationship with the assembly sector in Haiti.;5. On June 30, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12853 that expanded the blocking of assets of the de facto regime to include assets of Haitian nationals identified by the Secretary of the Treasury as providing substantial financial or material contributions to the regime, or doing substantial business with the regime. That Executive order also implemented U.N. Security Council Resolution (UNSC Resolution) 841 of June 16, 1993, by prohibiting the sale or supply by U.S. persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, or petroleum or petroleum products or arms and related materials of all types to any person or entity in Haiti, or for the purpose of any business carried on in or operated from Haiti, or promoting or calculated to promote such sale or supply. Carriage of such goods to Haiti on U.S.-registered vessels was prohibited, as was any transaction for the evasion or avoidance of, or attempt to evade or avoid, any prohibition in the order.;6. As reported earlier, apparent steady progress toward achieving the firm goal of restoring democracy in Haiti permitted the United States and the world community to suspend economic sanctions against Haiti in August 1993. With strong support from the United States, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 861 on August 27, 1993, suspending the petroleum, arms, and financial sanctions imposed under UNSC Resolution 841. On the same day, the Secretary General of the OAS announced that the OAS was urging member states to suspend their trade embargoes. In concert with these U.N. and OAS actions, U.S. trade and financial restrictions against Haiti were suspended, effective at 9:35 a.m. e.d.t., on August 31, 1993.;Our work to reach a solution to the Haitian crisis through the Governors Island Agreement was seriously threatened by accelerating violence in Haiti sponsored or tolerated by the de facto regime. The violence culminated on October 11, 1993, with the obstruction by armed "attaches" supported by the Haitian military and police of the deployment of U.S. military trainers and engineers sent to Haiti as part of the United Nations Mission in Haiti. The Haitian military's decision to dishonor its commitments made in the Governors Island Agreement was apparent. On October 13, 1993, the U.N. Security Council issued Resolution 873, which terminated the suspension of sanctions effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., October 18, 1993.;As a result, effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., October 18, 1993, the Department of the Treasury revoked the suspension of those trade and financial sanctions that had been suspended, so that the full scope of prior prohibitions was reinstated (58 Fed. Reg. 54024, October 19, 1993). The reinstated sanctions in the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 580 (the HTR), prohibited most unlicensed trade with Haiti, and blocked the assets of the de facto regime in Haiti, and of the Government of Haiti. Restrictions on the entry into U.S. ports of vessels whose Haitian calls would violate U.S. or OAS sanctions had they been made by U.S. persons were also reinstated.;Also effective at 11:59 p.m., October 18, 1993, I issued Executive Order No. 12872 (58 Fed. Reg. 54029), authorizing the Department of the Treasury to block assets of persons who have: (1) contributed to the obstruction of UNSC Resolutions 841 and 873, the Governors Island Agreement, or the activities of the U.N. Mission in Haiti, (2) perpetuated or contributed to the violence in Haiti, or (3) materially or financially supported either the obstruction or the violence referred to above. This authority was in addition to the blocking authority provided for in the original sanctions and in Executive Order No. 12853 of June 30, 1993, and ensured adequate authority to reach assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction of military and police officials, civilian "attaches" and their financial patrons meeting these criteria. A list of 41 such individuals was published on November 1, 1993, by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury (FAC) (58 Fed. Reg. 58480).;On October 18, 1993, I ordered the deployment of six U.S. Navy vessels off Haiti's shores. To improve compliance with the ban on petroleum and munitions shipments to Haiti contained in UNSC Resolutions 841 and 873, the United States succeeded in securing the passage of UNSC Resolution 875. UNSC Resolution 875 called upon the United Nations Member States, acting with national or through regional agencies or arrangements, to halt inbound maritime shipping for Haiti in order to inspect and verify that the Haiti-bound cargo does not contain UNSC prohibited petroleum or arms. A multinational Maritime Interdiction Force, including elements of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, was established.;7. The declaration of the national emergency on October 4, 1991, was made pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the Congress on October 4, 1991, pursuant to section 204(b) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703 (b)). The additional sanctions set forth in Executive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, and 12872 were imposed pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the statutes cited above, as well as the United Nations Participation Act, 22 U.S.C. 287c, and represent the response by the United States to the U.N. Security Council and OAS directives and recommendations discussed above.;8. Since my report of April 25, 1994, in order to implement UNSC Resolution 917 of May 6, and to take additional steps with respect to the actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti, I issued Executive Order No. 12914, dated May 7, 1994. Effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., on May 8, 1994, the order blocks all funds and financial resources of three categories of individuals that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches. These groups include (a) all officers of the Haitian military, including the police, and their immediate families, (b) the major participants in the coup d'etat in Haiti of 1991 and in the illegal governments since the coup d'etat and their immediate families, and (c) those employed by or acting on behalf of the Haitian military, and their immediate families. The Executive order also bans arriving and departing flights, and overflights stopping or originating in Haiti, except regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights. A copy of E.O. No. 12914 (59 Fed. Reg. 24339, May 10, 1994), is attached for reference.;9. Subsequently, on May 21, 1994, in implementation of UNSC Resolution 917 of May 6, and in order to further strengthen sanctions in response to the actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti, I issued Executive Order No. 12917. Effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., on May 21, 1994, the order prohibits (1) the importation into the United States of any goods originating in Haiti or services performed in Haiti, that are exported from Haiti after May 21, 1994, or any activity by any U.S. persons or in the United States that promotes, or is intended to promote, such importation, (2) any activity by U.S. persons or in the United States that promotes the exportation or transshipment of any goods originating in Haiti that are exported from Haiti after May 21, 1994, (3) any dealing by U.S. persons or in the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of any goods originating in Haiti that are exported from Haiti after May 21, 1994, and (4) the sale, supply, or exportation by U.S. persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of any goods, regardless of origin, to Haiti, or for the purpose of any business carried on in or operated from Haiti, or any activity by U.S. persons or in the United States that promotes such sale, supply, or exportation.;Exemptions from the foregoing prohibitions include: (1) informational materials, such as books and other publications, needed for the free flow of information, (2) the sale, supply, or exportation of medicines and medical supplies, as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, and rice, beans, sugar, wheat flour, cooking oil, corn, corn flour, milk and edible tallow, provided that neither the de facto regime in Haiti nor any person designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as a blocked individual or entity of Haiti is a direct or indirect party to the transaction, and (3) transactions specifically licensed or otherwise authorized by FAC. A copy of E.O. No. 12917 (59 Fed. Reg. 26925, May 24, 1994) is attached for reference.;10. Again, on June 10, 1994, in order to take additional steps with respect to the actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti, I issued Executive Order No. 12920. Effective at 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., on June 10, 1994, the order prohibits, first, any payment or transfer of funds or other financial or investment assets or credits to Haiti from or through the United States, or to or through the United States from Haiti, with the following exceptions: (1) payments and transfers for the conduct of activities in Haiti of the United States Government, the United Nations, the OAS, or foreign diplomatic missions, (2) payments and transfers between the United States and Haiti for the conduct of activities in Haiti of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) engaged in the provision in Haiti of essential humanitarian assistance as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, (3) payments and transfers from a U.S. person to any close relative of the remitter or of the remitter's spouse who is resident in Haiti, provided that such payments do not exceed $50.00 per month to any one household, and that neither the de facto regime in Haiti nor any person designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as a blocked individual or entity of Haiti is a beneficiary of the remittance, (4) reasonable amounts of funds carried by travelers to or from Haiti to cover their travel-related expenses, and (5) payments and transfers incidental to shipments to Haiti of food, medicine, medical supplies, and informational materials exempt from the export prohibitions of this order. The order also prohibits the sale, supply, or exportation by U.S. persons or from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, of any goods, technology, or services, regardless of origin, to Haiti, or for the purpose of any business carried on in or operated from Haiti, or any activity by U.S. persons in the United States that promotes such sale, supply, or exportation. Exportations of the following types are exempt from the foregoing provision: (1) informational materials, such as books and other publications needed for the free flow of information, (2) medicines and medical supplies, as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, and rice, beans, sugar, wheat flour, cooking oil, corn, corn flour, milk, and edible tallow, provided that neither the de facto regime in Haiti nor any person designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as a blocked individual or entity of Haiti is a direct or indirect party to the transaction, and (3) donations of food, medicine, and medical supplies intended to relieve human suffering. A copy of E.O. No. 12920 (59 Fed. Reg. 30501, June 14, 1994), is attached for reference.;11. Once again, on June 21, 1994, in order to take additional steps with respect to the actions and policies of the de facto regime in Haiti, I issued Executive Order No. 12922. Effective at 10:09 p.m. e.d.t., on June 21, 1994, the order blocks all property and interests in property that are or come within the United States or within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, of (1) any Haitian national resident in Haiti, or (2) any other person subject to the blocking provisions of Executive Order Nos. 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, or 12914 and Haitian citizens who are members of the immediate family of any such person, as identified by the Secretary of the Treasury. This provision does not apply to property of nongovernmental organizations engaged in the provision of essential humanitarian assistance in Haiti or in the conduct of refugee and migration operations in Haiti, as identified by the Secretary of the Treasury.;Payments and transfers previously authorized by Executive Order No. 12920, of June 10, 1994, may continue to be made in a manner directed by the Secretary of the Treasury. A copy of Executive Order No. 12922 (59 Fed. Reg. 32645, June 23, 1994), is attached for reference.;12. A policy statement, effective January 31, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 8134, February 18, 1994), was published to extend until March 31, 1994, the expiration date for all current assembly sector licenses issued by FAC pursuant to the HTR, and a second policy notice, effective March 29, 1994, was published on April 1, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 15342), extending these licenses through May 31, 1994. These licenses provided an exception to the comprehensive U.S. trade embargo on Haiti under which the "assembly sector" continued to receive parts and supplies from, and supply finished products to, persons in the United States.;Assembly sector trade with the United States accounted for a significant portion of Haiti's imports, and a substantial majority of its exports, prior to the institution of the OAS-requested embargo in November 1991. Although initially suspended due to the embargo, assembly sector imports from and exports to the United States were allowed to resume on a case-by-case basis beginning in February 1992 in order to keep poorer segments of the Haitian population employed and to reduce their incentive to attempt illegal and dangerous migration by sea to the United States and other countries. However, the continuing uncertainties of the Haitian situation led to a sharp decline in assembly sector activity, with such employment estimated by the spring of 1994 to be no more than 10 percent of preembargo levels.;As noted above and as mandated by UNSC Resolution 917, Executive Order No. 12917 further restricted imports from and exports to Haiti after May 21, 1994. Consequently, all FAC licenses for importation into the United States from the Haitian assembly sector were withdrawn effective May 22, 1994. The FAC is continuing, in close coordination with the Department of State, to evaluate license applications from U.S. companies seeking to repatriate capital equipment, parts, and components previously exported for use in assembly sector activities.;Following the successful deployment to Haiti of U.S. forces serving as the vanguard of the multinational coalition force, and as promised in my September 26 address before the United Nations General Assembly, amendments to the HTR were published on October 5, 1994, suspending, effective 10:28 a.m. on October 5, 1994, the sanctions that the United States had imposed on Haiti unilaterally, with the exceptions noted below. Section 580.211 of the HTR, which was added to the HTR in June 1992 to deny entry into U.S. ports to vessels engaged in certain trade transactions with Haiti, was removed. A new section, 580.518, was added to license generally the export from the United States to Haiti of all food and food products.;Section 580.519 was added to the HTR to remove the prohibition (which I had imposed in Executive Order No. 12920 on June 14) on payments or transfers of funds or other financial or investment assets to Haiti from or through the United States, or to or through the United States from Haiti. Section 580.520 was added to unblock the property and interests in the United States of Haitian nationals resident in Haiti, which I had blocked in Executive Order No. 12922 on June 23, however, section 580.520 provides that the property and interests in property of certain persons, listed in the revised "Appendix A" to the HTR, will remain blocked until further notice. The HTR were also amended by the addition of section 580.521 to permit the specific licensing of exports to Haiti of fuel and equipment for electric power generation, telecommunications materials, media and educational supplies, agricultural supplies, and construction and transportation supplies for humanitarian purposes. Section 580.522 was added to authorize the case-by-case licensing of charter flights between the United States and Haiti for use by humanitarian relief agencies to transport needed personnel and supplies, or for journalists covering events in Haiti. The HTR were also amended to provide, in new section 580.523, a general license authorizing the export to Haiti from the United States of equipment needed for reporting and broadcasting from Haiti and for documentary film making in Haiti, provided that such equipment is removed from Haiti when the reporting, broadcasting, or filming has been completed.;Each of the new sections added to the HTR provides that no transaction authorized thereunder may result in a payment or transfer to, from or through a person listed in the revised "Appendix A" to the HTR. In the revised "Appendix A" are set forth, in section I, the names of individuals who, until further notice, will remain "Blocked Individuals of Haiti," and in section II, entities of the de facto regime in Haiti whose assets will remain blocked.;On September 29, I directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue the necessary directives to terminate the ban on regularly-scheduled air passenger service between the United States and Haiti that had been imposed on June 24.;The HTR will be further amended upon the return of President Aristide to Haiti to provide that, in accordance with U.N. Resolution 944 of September 29, 1994, on the day following his return, the U.S. sanctions imposed pursuant to U.N. Resolutions 841, 873, and 917 will be terminated. At that time, I will also direct the Secretary of Transportation to rescind the ban on all other air transportation (all cargo and charter) between the United States and Haiti that I imposed on May 7, 1994.;13. Humanitarian Shipments. Executive Order No. 12917 revoked an earlier exception to the export ban permitting the exportation to Haiti of "donated articles to relieve human suffering." A substantial amount of humanitarian aid, such as clothing or shoes, had previously been shipped to Haiti pursuant to this exception. The exception of donated foodstuffs was not affected. However, the Executive order provides an exemption from its trade prohibitions for the sale, supply, or exportation of certain basic commodities essential to humanitarian assistance programs serving Haiti's urban and rural poor, i.e., medicines and medical supplies and certain nutritional staples of the Haitian diet, as well as for informational materials. The FAC developed procedures to facilitate U.N. Sanctions Committee approval for humanitarian shipments to Haiti that do not fall within the narrowly-defined U.N. exemption categories. Specific authorizations have also been issued on a caseby-case basis for commercial deliveries to certain "blocked individuals of Haiti," in order to allow the continued supply in Haiti of essential foodstuffs, while retaining the ability to closely monitor such transactions. Food supplies and prices are being monitored for profiteering by Haitian food importers. Between issuance of Executive Order No. 12917 on May 21, and September 1, 1994, FAC issued 94 specific licenses for such humanitarian exports.;Humanitarian Services. Executive Order No. 12920 exempts from its financial prohibitions payments and transfers between the United States and Haiti in support of the conduct of activities in Haiti of NGOs engaged in the provision in Haiti of essential humanitarian assistance. The FAC immediately issued a specific license to the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), permitting it to continue uninterrupted its essential services in Haiti. Subsequently, based on recommendations by AID and the State Department, FAC developed a system of registration for NGOs engaged in relief efforts such as the delivery of food, medicine and medical supplies, as well as refugee and migration operations, to assure that approved payment orders are neither rejected nor blocked by U.S. banks in implementing the financial prohibitions of recent Executive orders. Since June 10, FAC has registered 156 NGOs, of which 16 have been issued specific licenses authorizing provision of their services in Haiti. One application has been denied. Others are under review by the Department of State and AID.;Air Transportation Services. Executive Order No. 12914, effective 11:59 p.m. e.d.t., May 8, 1994, banned arriving and departing flights and overflights stopping or originating in Haiti, except regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights. On June 10, an order was issued by the President to the Secretary of Transportation that terminated, effective June 24, 1994, regularly scheduled air service between the United States and Haiti by U.S. and Haitian carriers.;Specific licenses have been issued to authorize air ambulance services for medical evacuation flights to and from Haiti. Licenses have also been issued to authorize certain cargo flights for the delivery of humanitarian shipments, including food and medicine, by registered NGOs, as well as passenger service for NGO personnel and a congressional delegation wishing to assist in food distribution. The FAC also has licensed a U.S. air carrier to continue paying its Haitian employees in Port-au-Prince. In addition to providing support for the airline's Haitian employees and their families, the license aimed to position the airline to resume service speedily in the event of an emergency or when sanctions were lifted. Effective on the date of the rescission of the June 10, 1994, unilateral ban on scheduled air service between the United States and Haiti, carriers are authorized to resume such in coordination with the commander of the Multinational Force who controls the Haitian airports.;More than 35 requests have been received from news organizations for specific licenses to charter flights to Haiti in connection with newsgathering activities, ranging from personnel rotation and equipment transportation to proposals from nationally known television anchors to conduct interviews. Licensees include major U.S. and foreign networks.;Blocked Haitian-Owned Vessels. Several dozen Haitian-owned vessels in the United States were blocked by Executive Order No. 12922 on June 21, 1994. Nearly all such vessels were old, smallcapacity vessels (many wood-hulled) that formerly loaded and discharged cargoes along the narrow Miami River. These vessels that had previously delivered the bulk of humanitarian assistance shipments to Haiti, were moored at the facilities of their U.S. agents and presented a serious hazard to navigation (particularly with the onset of the hurricane season), clogging the channel and occupying needed docking space. Most Haitian-owners were unable to finance the costs of a long-term lay-up. Some 170 crew members, who were confined to the vessels, were faced with diminishing provisions and maintenance supplies, and dependency upon donations from the local community.;Specific licenses have been issued to U.S. agents for the blocked vessels to authorize the provisioning, maintenance and repairs necessary to ensure seaworthiness to facilitate the lawful return of crew members to their home countries. No debits of U.S.-blocked funds were authorized by such licenses. The FAC has also issued licenses effectively unblocking the Haitian vessels by authorizing them to engage in trade transactions consistent with sanctions, particularly the carriage of authorized humanitarian supplies to Haiti. In some cases, where appropriate, the vessels were licensed to depart the United States but not return for the duration of the sanctions.;14. Following the issuance of the blocking order in Executive Order No. 12922 on June 21, more than 1,200 Haitian accounts were blocked totaling in excess of $79.1 million as of August 30, 1994. This success was due, in part, to FAC notices about the new Executive orders posted to banks through the Federal Reserve, the New York Clearing House, the Council on International Banking and the International Banking Operations Association in Miami. Notices also were posted to other electronic bulletin boards such as the Federal Bulletin Board of the United States Government Printing Office and the Economic Bulletin Board of the Department of Commerce. These notices were passed on to family remittance forwarders by banking oversight authorities in New York and Florida. The FAC launched an aggressive compliance initiative to identify family remittance forwarders in the Miami area who route funds to Haiti. This review revealed that one of the largest companies in south Florida handling remittances to Haiti (previously valued at about $500,000 per month) is owned and controlled by a Haitian national resident in Haiti. The company's accounts, with combined balances of more than $1 million, were blocked and other enforcement actions involving them were undertaken.;15. Continued close coordination between FAC special agents and the U.S. Customs Service in Miami has resulted in the interception of substantial quantities of checks and currency transported from and to Haiti through the United States, as well as the seizure of merchandise valued at $1.5 million. Numerous other enforcement matters are under active investigation.;During the reporting period, the multinational Maritime Interdiction Force (MIF), which contains elements of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, continued to patrol offshore Haiti and to conduct ship boardings, inspections of cargoes bound for Haiti, identification of suspected violators and referrals for investigation. The MIF boardings resulted in numerous vessel diversions to non-Haitian ports after MIF boarding parties determined that cargo was not fully accessible for inspection or that vessels were attempting to enter Haiti with cargo prohibited by UNSC resolutions and U.S. sanctions. The FAC acted on MIF boarding reports by subsequently denying entry into the United States of several vessels that had attempted to violate the sanctions. With assumption of control of Haitian ports by the Multinational Force following its September 19 deployment to Haiti, enforcement of the maritime sanctions in the ports became possible. The MIF operations therefore were terminated on September 28, 1994.;16. Since my report of April 25, 1994, in consultation with the Department of State and other Federal agencies, FAC has issued General Notices No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, and No. 10, "Notification of Blocked Individuals and Blocked Entities of Haiti." The Notices (issued June 2, June 17, June 22 (two Notices), August 2, and September 14, 1994, respectively) identify a total of 372 additional individuals and 94 companies and banks determined by the Department of the Treasury to be Blocked Individuals and Blocked Entities of Haiti. These are persons (1) who seized power illegally from the democratically-elected government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on September 30, 1991, or who have since the effective date of Executive Order No. 12775, acted or purported to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, or under the asserted authority of, such persons or of any agencies, instrumentalities or entities of the de facto regime in Haiti or any extra-constitutional successor thereto, (2) are the immediate family members of an individual who is (a) an officer of the Haitian military, including the police, (b) a major participant in the coup d'etat in Haiti of 1991 or in the illegal governments since the coup d'etat, (c) employed by or acting on behalf of the Haitian military, or (d) a Haitian national resident in Haiti, or persons subject to the blocking provisions of Executive Orders No. 12775, No. 12779, No. 12853, No. 12872, or No. 12914, or a Haitian citizen who is member of the immediate family of such person. United States persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with these entities and individuals and with all officers of the Haitian military unless the transactions are licensed by FAC. All assets owned or controlled by these parties that are or come within the United States or that are or come within the possession or control of U.S. persons, including their overseas branches, are blocked. United States persons are not prohibited, however, from paying funds owed to these entities or individuals into blocked Government of Haiti Account No. 021083909 at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or, pursuant to specific licenses issued by FAC, into blocked accounts held in the names of the blocked parties in domestic U.S. financial institutions. Copies of General Notices No. 5 - No. 10 are attached for reference.;On August 18, 1994, in consultation with the Department of State and other Federal agencies, FAC identified three additional entities of Haiti, whose property and interests in property are now blocked pursuant to Executive Order No. 12922. On the same date, FAC removed the name of one individual from the list of Blocked Individuals of Haiti. These actions bring the total number of entities so blocked to 128 and the number of individuals to 916.;Since March 1994, FAC has collected 49 civil monetary penalties, totaling in excess of $133,000 as of August 30, 1994. Penalties were imposed pursuant to FAC enforcement investigations, U.S. Customs Service referrals, and FAC compliance audits of reports required pursuant to specific licenses. The enforcement investigations dealt with violations of the HTR by vessels carrying unauthorized and nonexempt cargo to Haiti. The Customs Service referrals all involved import and export violations of the embargo. Compliance audits related to licenses issued to U.S. participants in Haiti's assembly sector.;17. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month period from April 4 through October 3, 1994, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Haiti are estimated at about $3.7 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in FAC, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Office of the General Counsel), the Department of State, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Department of Commerce.;The combination over time of mediation among the Haitian parties and steadily intensified sanctions proved, in the end, ineffective in budging the Haitian military leaders from their stubborn and illegal hold on power. Only the imminent threat of force combined with determined diplomacy was in the end successful in making it possible to achieve our objectives and further our national interests regarding Haiti. With the return of Haiti's democraticallyelected President near, it is my hope and expectation that those U.N. and unilateral sanctions that remain in effect, as detailed in this report, can soon be terminated, and that I will shortly have the privilege of sending to you my final report, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) on implementation of the national emergency regarding Haiti declared 3 years ago by the previous Administration in Executive Order No. 12775.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">February 2, 1995</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr. Chairman;In accordance with section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug producing or drug transit countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Venezuela. These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the April 1, 1994, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and from other United States Government sources.;While it is an important cannabis producer, Morocco does not appear on this list since I have determined that its estimated 30,000 hectares of illicit cannabis cultivation are consumed mostly in Europe and North Africa as hashish and do not significantly affect the United States. (Under section 481(e)(2)(C) of the Foreign Assistance Act, as amended by the International Narcotics Control Corrections Act of 1994, the term "major illicit drug producing country" is defined to include countries in which 5,000 hectares or more of illicit cannabis is cultivated or harvested during a year, unless I determine that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.);This year the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Taiwan, and Vietnam have been added to the list and Belize has been removed for the following reasons;Dominican Republic and Haiti. These countries share an important location astride one of the key transit routes for drugs moving from South America to the United States. Over the past few years, there has been continuing evidence that Colombian traffickers use the Dominican Republic to transship cocaine bound for the United States. A number of metric ton cocaine seizures in Puerto Rico were delivered in small craft proceeding from Dominican ports. In March 1993, the U.S. Coast Guard seized 756 kilograms of cocaine just south of the Dominican Republic. In June 1993, Dominican authorities seized another 784 kilograms on the country's northern coast. As of November 29, 1994, Dominican authorities had seized 2.6 metric tons of cocaine this year. These record seizures represent an increasingly active and effective counternarcotics effort on the part of the Dominican government in 1994. We look forward to building upon this cooperation in the coming year.;There is strong evidence that much of the cocaine passing through the Dominican Republic was originally delivered on the Haitian side of the island, where until September a chaotic political situation provided an environment for drug trafficking. Before the U.S. intervention, Haitian authorities reported seizing 716 kilograms of cocaine. Accurate measurement of the volume of drugs moving through Haiti, however, was difficult because of the minimal cooperation from the military regime.;Since the intervention, measures taken by the Aristide government, as well as improved cooperation between the Haitian and United States Governments, appear to have drastically reduced trafficking through the Haitian part of Hispaniola. We expect that the return of democratic government will make it harder to move drugs through Haiti, but its geographical location will continue to offer a convenient transshipment point for U.S.-bound drugs. We plan to work closely with Haitian authorities to develop even more effective antidrug programs in the months ahead.;Taiwan. Taiwan has become an important point for the transshipment and repackaging of heroin and should be included on the list on that basis. The recordbreaking U.S. seizures of nearly half a metric ton (486 kilograms) of heroin in 1991 was transshipped through Taiwan. Heroin seizures in Taiwan have risen from 240 kilograms in 1991 to more than one metric ton (1,114 kilograms) in 1993, confirming Taiwan's role as a point of major activity in the heroin trade. Taiwan authorities are aware of the heroin trafficking problem they face and have mounted a vigorous drug enforcement campaign that is responsible for the recent high volume of seizures.;Vietnam. We have no official United States Government estimate of opium cultivation in Vietnam, but the Government of Vietnam and the United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) agree that cultivation far exceeds the 1,000-hectare threshold that requires inclusion on the list as a drug producing country. According to the UNDCP, over 14,000 hectares of opium were cultivated in the 1992/93 growing season, 10,000 of which were eradicated and 4,000 harvested. A Government of Vietnam source stated that 3,770 hectares were cultivated in the 1993/94 season. Vietnam also has a worsening drug addiction problem and a growing role as a transit and trafficking point for Southeast Asian heroin.;Belize. Belize was originally listed as a major cannabis producer at a time when the country's marijuana exports were having an impact in the United States. Since joint eradication efforts have effectively reduced cannabis to negligible amounts. Belize has been removed from the list of major drug producing countries. We will be watching to determine whether it becomes a major transit point for drugs moving to the United States.;Although Cambodia and Cuba have not been added to the list during this cycle, their strategic location along major trafficking routes makes them logical prospects for inclusion as major drug transit countries. We do not yet have sufficient information to evaluate either country's importance in the transit of U.S.-bound drugs. We will be observing them closely with the possibility of adding one or both to the list in the future if the circumstances warrant.;In my letter of January 3, 1994, to your predecessors, setting forth last year's list of major illicit drug producing and drug transit countries, I noted that we were examining the possibly significant illicit cultivation of opium poppies in Central Asia and anticipated completion of our assessment by 1995. Because of technical and resource limitations, we do not yet have useful survey results on opium cultivation in Central Asia. We hope to be in a better position to assess the situation by late 1995.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Message to the Congress Reporting on the National Emergency With Respect to Haiti</td><td class="c6">February 3, 1995</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;1. In December 1990, the Haitian people elected Jean-Bertrand Aristide as their President by an overwhelming margin in a free and fair election. The United States praised Haiti's success in peacefully implementing its democratic constitutional system and provided significant political and economic support to the new government. The Haitian military abruptly interrupted the consolidation of Haiti's new democracy when, in September 1991, it illegally and violently ousted President Aristide from office and drove him into exile.;2. The United States, on its own and with the Organization of American States (OAS), immediately imposed sanctions against the illegal regime. Upon the recommendation of the legitimate government of President Aristide and of the OAS, the United Nations Security Council imposed incrementally a universal embargo on Haiti, beginning June 16, 1993, with trade restrictions on certain strategic commodities. The United States actively supported the efforts of the OAS and the United Nations to restore democracy to Haiti and to bring about President Aristide's return by facilitating negotiations between the Haitian parties. The United States and the international community also offered material assistance within the context of an eventual negotiated settlement of the Haitian crisis to support the return to democracy, build constitutional structures, and foster economic well-being.;The continued defiance of the will of the international community by the illegal regime led to an intensification of bilateral and multilateral economic sanctions against Haiti in May 1994. The U.N. Security Council on May 6 adopted Resolution 917, imposing comprehensive trade sanctions and other measures on Haiti. This was followed by a succession of unilateral U.S. sanctions designed to isolate the illegal regime. To augment embargo enforcement, the United States and other countries entered into a cooperative endeavor with the Dominican Republic to monitor that country's enforcement of sanctions along its land border and in its coastal waters.;Defying coordinated international efforts, the illegal military regime in Haiti remained intransigent for some time. Internal repression continued to worsen, exemplified by the expulsion in July 1994 of the U.N./O.A.S.-sponsored International Civilian Mission (ICM) human rights observers. Responding to the threat to peace and security in the region, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 940 on July 31, 1994, authorizing the formation of a multinational force to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership and the return of legitimate authorities including President Aristide.;In the succeeding weeks, the international community under U.S. leadership assembled a multinational coalition force to carry out this mandate. At my request, former President Carter, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell went to Haiti on September 16 to meet with the de facto Haitian leadership. The threat of imminent military intervention combined with determined diplomacy achieved agreement in Portau-Prince on September 18 for the de facto leaders to relinquish power by October 15. United States forces in the vanguard of the multinational coalition force drawn from 26 countries began a peaceful deployment in Haiti on September 19 and the military leaders have since relinquished power.;In a spirit of reconciliation and reconstruction, on September 25 President Aristide called for the immediate easing of sanctions so that the work of rebuilding could begin. In response to this request, on September 26 in an address before the United Nations General Assembly, I announced my intention to suspend all unilateral sanctions against Haiti except those that affected the military leaders and their immediate supporters and families. On September 29, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 944 terminating U.N.-imposed sanctions as of the day after President Aristide returned to Haiti.;On October 15, President Aristide returned to Haiti to assume his official responsibilities. Effective October 16, 1994, by Executive Order No. 12932 (59 Fed. Reg. 52403, October 14, 1994), I terminated the national emergency declared on October 4, 1991, in Executive Order No. 12775, along with all sanctions with respect to Haiti imposed in that Executive order, subsequent Executive orders, and the Department of the Treasury regulations to deal with that emergency. This termination does not affect compliance and enforcement actions involving prior transactions or violations of the sanctions.;3. This report is submitted to the Congress pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and 1703(c). It is not a report on all U.S. activities with respect to Haiti, but discusses only those Administration actions and expenses since my last report (October 13, 1994) that are directly related to the national emergency with respect to Haiti declared in Executive Order No. 12775, as implemented pursuant to that order and Executive Orders Nos. 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, and 12922.;4. The Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (FAC) amended the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 580 (the "HTR") on December 27, 1994 (59 Fed. Reg. 66476, December 27, 1994), to add section 580.524, indicating the termination of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order No. 12932, effective October 16, 1994. The effect of this amendment is to authorize all transactions previously prohibited by subpart B of the HTR or by the previously stated Executive orders. Reports due under general or specific license must still be filed with FAC covering activities up until the effective date of this termination. Enforcement actions with respect to past violations of the sanctions are not affected by the termination of sanctions. A copy of the FAC amendment is attached.;5. The total expenses incurred by the Federal Government during the period of the national emergency with respect to Haiti from October 4, 1991, through October 15, 1994, that are directly attributable to the authorities conferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to Haiti are estimated to be approximately $6.2 million, most of which represent wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. This estimate has been revised downward substantially from the sum of estimates previously reported in order to eliminate certain previously reported costs incurred with respect to Haiti, but not directly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration of the terminated national emergency with respect to Haiti.;Thus, with the termination of sanctions, this is the last periodic report that will be submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) and also constitutes the last semiannual report and final report on Administration expenditures required pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c).;WILLIAM J.

Clinton: Remarks at the University of Connecticut in Storrs</td><td class="c6">October 15, 1995</td><td class="c7">Thank you very much, first, Senator Dodd, for your dedication and your service, your friendship, and your wonderful, wonderful introduction. It's worth three more strokes the next time we play golf. [ Laughter ] Chairman Rome, President Hartley, Governor Rowland, Senator Lieberman, members of the congressional delegation, and especially your Congressman, Representative Gejdenson, thank you for your fine remarks here today. To the State officials who are here and the Senators and former Members of the United States Senate, to my friend Governor O'Neill and all others who have served this great State, the faculty, students, and friends of the University of Connecticut, and to the remarkable American treasure, Morton Gould, who composed that awesome piece of music we heard just before we started the program.;Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here. As an old musician, I'd like to begin by congratulating the wind ensemble. They were quite wonderful in every way, I thought. As a near fanatic basketball fan, I am glad to be in a place where it can truly be said there is no other place in America where both men and women play basketball so well under the same roof. And at the risk of offending the Dodd family and all the other Irish who are here, I want to say that your new football coach, with his remarkable record, learned at his father's knee, not at Notre Dame but when he spent 9 years in my home State as a football coach. [ Laughter ] But congratulations on that great start for the University of Connecticut football team. That is a remarkable thing.;When Governor Rowland made his fine remarks and talked about the Special Olympians turning their cameras around and turning their camera sighting into the telescope, I thought it was a remarkable story. And I was wondering if he could identify them and arrange to send them to Washington for a few weeks—[ laughter ]—so that we might clear vision down there as we make these decisions.;Let me also say just one other thing by way of introduction. The State of Connecticut is really fortunate to have two such remarkable United States Senators, and I am very fortunate to have known both of them a long, long time before I became the President and a long, long time before either one of them thought that was even a remote possibility for the United States. [ Laughter ];I was a student at Yale Law School and a sometime volunteer when Joe Lieberman first ran for the State senate back in 1970. He still barely looks old enough to be a State senator. [ Laughter ] And I thank him for the remarkable blend of new ideas and common sense and oldfashioned values he brings to the Senate.;And in many, many ways I have enjoyed a long and rich personal friendship with Chris Dodd. I can't add anything to what Senator Lieberman said, but I will say this: At a time when every person in public life talks about family values, it is quite one thing to talk and another thing to do. And I have been very moved by the family values of the Dodd family and what they have done together that has brought this magnificent day to pass. And I honor them all and especially my friend Senator Chris Dodd.;I have been asked today to inaugurate the first Dodd center symposium on the topic of "50 Years After Nuremberg." I am honored to do that. I was born just after World War II, and I grew up as a part of a generation of young students who were literally fascinated by every aspect of the Nuremberg trials and what their ramifications were and were not for every unfolding event in the world that was disturbing to human conscience.;I wish that Tom Dodd could be here today to see this center take life, not only because of what his family and friends and this State have done but because now, for all time, we will be able to study this great question as we strive to overcome human evil and human failing to be better.;Senator Dodd, as we know, was a man of extraordinary breadth and depth, who was passionate about civil rights three decades before the civil rights movement changed the face of our Nation, who fought to provide the young people of America with an education and a decent job, a fight that is never-ending, who understood then the menace of violence and guns and drugs on the streets of our cities. And if only others had joined him firmly then, think what we might have avoided today.;But most important, we look today at his experience at Nuremberg as a prosecutor, an experience that compelled him for the rest of his life to stand up for freedom and human dignity all around the world. He made a great deal of difference. And now, because his spirit lives on in the Dodd center, he will be able to make a difference forever.;A few moments ago, in the powerful documentary we watched on Nuremberg, our chief prosecutor, Mr. Justice Jackson's words spoke to us across three decades: "The wrongs which we seek to condemn and punish have been so calculated, so malignant, and so devastating, that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored because it cannot survive their being repeated.;At Nuremberg, the international community declared that those responsible for crimes against humanity will be held accountable without the usual defenses afforded to people in times of war. The very existence of the Tribunal was a triumph for justice and for humanity and for the proposition that there must be limits even in wartime. Flush with victory, outraged by the evil of the Nazi death camps, the Allies easily could have simply lashed out in revenge. But the terrible struggle of World War II was a struggle for the very soul of humankind. To deny its oppressors the rights they had stripped from their victims would have been to win the war but to lose the larger struggle. The Allies understood that the only answer to inhumanity is justice. And as Senator Dodd said, three of the defendants were actually acquitted, even in that tumultuous, passionate environment.;In the years since Nuremberg, the hope that convicting those guilty of making aggressive war would deter future wars and prevent future crimes against humanity, including genocide, frankly, has gone unfulfilled too often. From 1945 until the present day, wars between and within nations, including practices which were found to be illegal at Nuremberg, have cost more than 20 million lives. The wrongs Justice Jackson hoped Nuremberg would end have not been repeated on the scale of Nazi Germany, in the way that they did it, but they have been repeated and repeated on a scale that still staggers the imagination.;Still, Nuremberg was a crucial first step. It rendered a clear verdict on atrocities. It placed human rights on a higher ground. It set a timeless precedent by stripping away convenient excuses for abominable conduct. Now it falls to our generation to make good on its promise, to put into practice the principle that those who violate universal human rights must be called to account for those actions.;This mission demands the abiding commitment of all people. And like many of the other challenges of our time, it requires the power of our Nation's example and the strength of our leadership, first, because America was founded on the proposition that all God's children have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are values that define us as a nation, but they are not unique to our experience. All over the world, from Russia to South Africa, from Poland to Cambodia, people have been willing to fight and to die for them.;Second, we have to do it because, while fascism and communism are dead or discredited, the forces of hatred and intolerance live on as they will for as long as human beings are permitted to exist on this planet Earth. Today, it is ethnic violence, religious strife, terrorism. These threats confront our generation in a way that still would spread darkness over light, disintegration over integration, chaos over community. Our purpose is to fight them, to defeat them, to support and sustain the powerful worldwide aspirations of democracy, dignity, and freedom.;And finally, we must do it because, in the aftermath of the cold war, we are the world's only superpower. We have to do it because while we seek to do everything we possibly can in the world in cooperation with other nations, they find it difficult to proceed in cooperation if we are not there as a partner and very often as a leader.;With our purpose and with our position comes the responsibility to help shine the light of justice on those who would deny to others their most basic human rights. We have an obligation to carry forward the lessons of Nuremberg. That is why we strongly support the United Nations War Crimes Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda.;The goals of these tribunals are straightforward: to punish those responsible for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, to deter future such crimes, and to help nations that were torn apart by violence begin the process of healing and reconciliation.;The tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has made excellent progress. It has collected volumes of evidence of atrocities, including the establishment of death camps, mass executions, and systematic campaigns of rape and terror. This evidence is the basis for the indictments the tribunal already has issued against 43 separate individuals. And this week, 10 witnesses gave dramatic, compelling testimony against one of the indictees in a public proceeding. These indictments are not negotiable. Those accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide must be brought to justice. They must be tried and, if found guilty, they must be held accountable. Some people are concerned that pursuing peace in Bosnia and prosecuting war criminals are incompatible goals. But I believe they are wrong. There must be peace for justice to prevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.;In recent weeks, the combination of American leadership, NATO's resolve, the international community's diplomatic determination: these elements have brought us closer to a settlement in Bosnia than at any time since the war began there 4 years ago.;So let me repeat again what I have said consistently for over 2 years: If and when the parties do make peace, the United States, through NATO, must help to secure it. Only NATO can strongly and effectively implement a settlement. And the United States, as NATO's leader, must do its part and join our troops to those of our allies in such an operation. If you were moved by the film we saw and you believe that it carries lessons for the present day and you accept the fact that not only our values but our position as the world's only superpower impose upon us an obligation to carry through, then the conclusion is inevitable: We must help to secure a peace if a peace can be reached in Bosnia. We will not send our troops into combat. We will not ask them to keep a peace that cannot be maintained. But we must use our power to secure a peace and to implement the agreement.;We have an opportunity and a responsibility to help resolve this, the most difficult security challenge in the heart of Europe since World War II. When His Holiness the Pope was here just a few days ago, we spent a little over a half an hour alone, and we talked of many things. But in the end, he said, "Mr. President, I am not a young man. I have a long memory. This century began with a war in Sarajevo. We must not let this century end with a war in Sarajevo.;Even if a peace agreement is reached, and I hope that we can do that, no peace will endure for long without justice. For only justice can break finally the cycle of violence and retribution that fuels war and crimes against humanity. Only justice can lift the burden of collective guilt. It weighs upon a society where unspeakable acts of destruction have occurred. Only justice can assign responsibility to the guilty and allow everyone else to get on with the hard work of rebuilding and reconciliation. So as the United States leads the international effort to forge a lasting peace in Bosnia, the War Crimes Tribunal must carry on its work to find justice.;The United States is contributing more than $16 million in funds and services to that tribunal and to the one regarding Rwanda. We have 20 prosecutors, investigators, and other personnel on the staffs. And at the United Nations, we have led the effort to secure adequate funding for these tribunals. And we continue to press others to make voluntary contributions. We do this because we believe doing it is part of acting on the lessons that Senator Dodd and others taught us at Nuremberg.;By successfully prosecuting war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, we can send a strong signal to those who would use the cover of war to commit terrible atrocities that they cannot escape the consequences of such actions. And a signal will come across even more loudly and clearly if nations all around the world who value freedom and tolerance establish a permanent international court to prosecute, with the support of the United Nations Security Council, serious violations of humanitarian law. This, it seems to me, would be the ultimate tribute to the people who did such important work at Nuremberg, a permanent international court to prosecute such violations. And we are working today at the United Nations to see whether it can be done.;But my fellow Americans and my fellow citizens of the world, let me also say that our commitment to punish these crimes against humanity must be matched by our commitment to prevent them in the first place. As we work to support these tribunals, let's not forget what our ultimate goal is. Our ultimate goal must be to render them completely obsolete because such things no longer occur.;Accountability is a powerful deterrent, but it isn't enough. It doesn't get to the root cause of such atrocities. Only a profound change in the nature of societies can begin to reach the heart of the matter. And I believe the basis of that profound change is democracy.;Democracy is the best guarantor of human rights—not a perfect one, to be sure, you can see that in the history of the United States— but it is still the system that demands respect for the individual, and it requires responsibility from the individual to thrive. Democracy cannot eliminate all violations of human rights or outlaw human frailty, nor does promoting democracy relieve us of the obligation to press others who do not operate democracies to respect human rights. But more than any other system of government we know, democracy protects those rights, defends the victims of their abuse, punishes the perpetrators, and prevents a downward spiral of revenge.;So promoting democracy does more than advance our ideals. It reinforces our interests. Where the rule of law prevails, where governments are held accountable, where ideas and information flow freely, economic development and political stability are more likely to take hold and human rights are more likely to thrive. History teaches us that democracies are less likely to go to war, less likely to traffic in terrorism and more likely to stand against the forces of hatred and destruction, more likely to become good partners in diplomacy and trade. So promoting democracy and defending human rights is good for the world and good for America.;These aims have always had a powerful advocate in Senator Chris Dodd, who has defended the vulnerable and championed democracy, especially here in our own hemisphere, as has his brother, Tom, first as a distinguished academic at our common alma mater, Georgetown, and then as America's Ambassador to Uruguay.;As a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic, Senator Dodd helped some of our poorest neighbors to build homes for their families. Twenty-five years later, when a brutal dictatorship overthrew the legitimate government of Haiti, murdering, mutilating, and raping thousands and causing tens of thousands more to flee in fear, Chris Dodd was the conscience of the Senate on Haiti. He urged America and the world to take action.;On this very day one year ago, an Americanled multinational force returned the duly elected President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to his country. The anniversary we celebrate today was the culmination of a 3-year effort by the United States and the international community to remove the dictators and restore democracy. Because we backed diplomacy with the force of our military, the dictators finally did step down. And Haiti's democrats stepped back into their rightful place.;Our actions ended a reign of terror that did violence not only to innocent Haitians but to the values and the principles of the civilized world. We renewed hope in Haiti's future where once there was only despair. We upheld the reliability of our own commitments and the commitments that others make to us. We sent a powerful message to the would-be despots in the region: Democracy in the Americas cannot be overthrown with impunity.;We have seen extraordinary progress in this year. The democratic government has been restored. Human rights are its purpose, not its disgrace. Violence has subsided, though not ended altogether. Peaceful elections have occurred. Reform is underway. A new civilian police force has already more than 1,000 officers on the street. A growing private sector is beginning to generate jobs and opportunity. After so much blood and terror, the people of Haiti have resumed their long journey to security and prosperity with dignity.;There is a lot of work to do. Haiti is still the poorest nation in our hemisphere, and that is a breeding ground for the things we all come here to condemn today. Its democratic institutions are fragile, and all those years of vicious oppression have left scars and some still thirsting for revenge.;For reform to take root and to endure, trust must be fully established not only between the Government and the people but among the people of Haiti themselves. President Aristide understands that when he says, no to violence, yes to justice, no to vengeance, yes to reconciliation.;This is very important. Assigning individual responsibilities for crimes of the past is also important there. Haiti now has a national commission for truth and justice, launching investigations of past human rights abuses. And with our support, Haiti is improving the effectiveness, accessibility, and accountability of its own justice system, again, to prevent future violations as well as to punish those which occur.;The people of Haiti know it's up to them to safeguard their freedom. But we know, as President Kennedy said, that democracy is never a final achievement. And just as the American people, after 200 years, are continually struggling to perfect our own democracy, we must and we will stand with the people of Haiti as they struggle to build their own. Indeed, the Vice President is just today in Haiti celebrating the one-year anniversary.;And let me say one final thing about this. I thank Senator Dodd and Ambassador Dodd for their concern with freedom, democracy, and getting rid of the horrible human rights abuses that have occurred in the past throughout the Americas. The First Lady is in South America today—or she would be here with me—partly because of the path that has been blazed by the Dodd family in this generation to stand up for democracy, so that every single country of the Americas, save one, now has a democratically elected leader. And human rights abuses and the kinds of crimes that Senator Thomas Dodd stood up against at Nuremberg are dramatically, dramatically reduced because of that process and this family's leadership.;In closing, let me say that, for all of the work we might do through tribunals to bring the guilty to account, it is our daily commitment to the ideals of human dignity, democracy, and peace that has been and will continue to be the source of our strength in the world and our capacity to work with others to prevent such terrible things from occurring in the first place.;We will continue to defend the values we believe make life worth living. We will continue to defend the proposition that all people, without regard to their nationality, their race, their ethnic group, their religion, their gender, should have the chance to live free, should have the chance to make the most of their God-given potential. For too long, all across the globe, women and their children, in particular, were denied these human rights. Those were the rights for which the First Lady spoke so forcefully in China at the women's conference and for which the United States will work hard in the years ahead.;Ladies and gentlemen, we are living in a moment of great hope and possibility. The capacity of the United States to lead has been energized by our ability to succeed economically in the global economy and by the efforts we are making to come to grips with our own problems here at home. But I leave you with this thought that was referred to by the Governor in his fine remarks and that the president of this University has emphasized in his comments today.;It is important that we be able to act upon our values. And what enables us to do it is our success as a nation, our strength as a people, the fact that people can see that if you live as we say we should live, that people can work together across racial and ethnic and other divides to create one from many, as our motto says, and to do well.;Therefore, we should in the weeks ahead in Washington find a way to come together across our political divide to balance the budget after the deficit has taken such a toll on our economy over the last dozen years. But I ask you to remember this: We must do it in a way that is consistent with our values and with our ability to live by and implement and support those values here at home and all around the world.;Therefore, if our goal is to preserve our ideals and our dreams and our leadership and to extend them to all Americans, when we balance the budget we must not turn our backs on our obligation to give all Americans a chance to get an education, including a college education, to honor our fathers and our mothers in terms of how we treat their legitimate needs which they have earned the right to have addressed, including their health care needs, and not to forget the poor children, even though it is unfashionable to talk about poverty in this world today. They will be the adults of this country someday.;We are strong because we honor each other across the generations. We are strong when we reach across the racial and ethnic divides. We are strong when we continue to invest in education and the technology which opens all the mysterious doors of the future. We are strong when we preserve the environment that God gave us here at home and around our increasingly interconnected planet. We are strong when we continue to determine to lead the world.;These are the things which make it possible for us to meet here in Connecticut today and advocate the responsibility of the United States to lead in the protection of human rights around the world and the prevention of future horrendous circumstances such as those that Senator Dodd had to address at Nuremberg.;So I ask you to remember those lessons as well. If we have an obligation to stand up for what is right, to advance what is right, to lift up human potential, we must be able to fulfill that obligation.;If there is one last lesson of this day, I believe it should be that prosperity for the United States is not the most important thing and not an end in itself. We should seek it only, only, as a means to enhance the human spirit, to enhance human dignity, to enhance the ability of every person in our country and those whom we have the means to help around the world to become the people God meant for them to be. If we can remember that, then we can be faithful to the generation that won World War II, to the outstanding leaders which established the important precedents at Nuremberg, and to the mission and the spirit of the Dodd center.;Thank you, and God bless you all.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">February 22, 1996</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Ranking Member:);In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug producing or drug transit countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the March 1, 1995, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and from other United States Government sources.;No countries on the 1995 list have been removed from the list this year. I have added Belize and Cambodia to the list for the following reasons;Belize. In my letter of February 2, 1995, which removed Belize from last year's list of major drug-producing countries, I stated, "We will be watching to determine whether it becomes a major transit point for drugs moving to the United States." I did so because Belize's geographical location south of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula makes it an ideal strategic drug transshipment point for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. The country's long, unprotected coastline, large tracts of rain forest, many inland waterways and large unpopulated areas make Belize an inviting feeder site for moving drugs into the mainstream Mexican trafficking routes that carry the bulk of South American cocaine to U.S. markets. Despite a demonstrated commitment to cut off access to these routes, the Government of Belize lacks the human and material resources to control its borders adequately. In earlier years, the British Defense Forces stationed in Belize were a partial deterrent to drug traffic, though cocaine transited the country even then. Their withdrawal in late 1994 cleared the way for new trafficking opportunities.;There is little doubt that traffickers are exploiting Belize's vulnerable antidrug infrastructure, particularly as other countries have strengthened their counternarcotics efforts. The very factors that make Belize attractive as a backdoor to the Mexican cocaine route to the United States preclude a precise estimate of the volume of drugs transiting Belize. But it is clear from a number of airdrops off Belize's coast and important seizures that the trafficking organizations view it as a valuable transit point. Mexico's disruption of the large jets carrying multi-ton loads of cocaine ("cargas") has made Belize even more attractive as a feed-in point for U.S.-bound cocaine.;While shipments transiting Belize are smaller than those entering Mexico directly, they can still be sizable. For example, in a single operation in 1995, Belizean authorities seized more than half a ton (636 kilograms) of U.S.-bound cocaine and arrested two Colombians and a Belizean believed to be connected to the Cali cartel. In all of 1995, Belizean authorities seized a total of 840 kilograms of cocaine, which probably represents only a small fraction of the cocaine actually finding its way to the Mexican conduit to the United States. Moreover, this route is not new, since Belizean authorities reported seizing 850 kilograms of cocaine in 1993, and 650 kilograms in 1990. Consequently, I am now adding Belize to the list as a major drug transit country.;Cambodia. Over the past year we have seen numerous indicators that the heroin trafficking problem in Cambodia is severe. Newly formed and undertrained drug enforcement units have made large seizures of heroin. Cambodian police and customs sources have uncovered narcotics cases that involve the Cambodian military and police. Narcotics-related corruption also seems to be a problem in government and business circles. Cambodia shares borders with Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam—all countries on the list of major drug producing and drug transit countries.;The Cambodian government formally acknowledged that drug transshipment was a significant problem in a royal decree establishing an interministerial committee against narcotics signed by the King on September 7. The head of the Phnom Penh Municipal Counternarcotics Bureau has stated to the press that as much as 600 kilograms of heroin is smuggled through Cambodia each week. While we have no evidence to corroborate this figure, which seems high, seizures in Cambodia give us reason to believe there is a significant volume of heroin transiting the country. On August 11, the Cambodian Customs Service seized 71 kilograms of heroin hidden in a speedboat in Koh Kong province. This is the largest seizure ever made in Cambodia and one of the largest made in Southeast Asia this year. Two west African traffickers apprehended by the Cambodian authorities in July have admitted smuggling heroin to the United States and other destinations.;The extent of narcotics-related corruption suggests that the overall drug transshipment problem in Cambodia may be even greater than recent seizures suggest. There have been investigations and arrests involving both police and military suspects. Local police were arrested in the 71-kilogram heroin seizure in Koh Kong province. In August, Thai police arrested several Cambodians including members of the Cambodian military for attempting marijuana smuggling. For all the reasons listed above, I believe it is appropriate for Cambodia to be added to the list as a transit country.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, they do not appear on this list since I have determined that in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States, and thus such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States. (FAA 481(e)(2) states that a country that cultivates and harvests more than 5,000 hectares per year of illicit cannabis falls within the definition of a "major illicit drug producing country," unless I determine that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.);Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. Turkey and its neighboring countries play a key role as a major transit route for much of the Southwest Asian heroin moving to Western and Central Europe along the so-called Balkan Route. We know that some of this heroin also flows to the United States, but thus far our information has been limited and we have traced only relatively small quantities. We will be looking further into this issue over the next year. Insofar as we determine that heroin transiting Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, I will add such countries to the list.;Cuba. We still do not have sufficient evidence that Cuba plays an active role in the drug trade affecting the United States to add it to the list at this time. However, Cuba's geographic location and evidence of some movement of drugs around the island indicate it could become a target for greater trafficking activity in the future.;Central Asia. During 1995, we conducted probe efforts in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These probes did not show significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, I will add the relevant countries to the list.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Illicit Drug-Producing and Drug-Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">December 2, 1996</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Ranking Member:);In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug-producing or drug-transit countries: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the March 1, 1996, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and from other United States Government sources.;This year, I have added Aruba to the list of major illicit drug-transit countries. At the same time, I am adding the Netherlands Antilles to those countries that we monitor as potentially significant drug-transit countries. These already include Cuba, Turkey, the Balkan Route countries and the former poppy-growing countries of Central Asia.;Aruba. In the past 2 years, there has been a major shift in drug trafficking patterns, as enforcement activities in Mexico, the western Caribbean, and The Bahamas have pushed trafficking routes eastward. Taking advantage of the limited enforcement capabilities of most eastern Caribbean countries, Colombian drug syndicates have been routing U.S.-bound cocaine and heroin through the region. Consequently, countries that in the past have been peripheral to the drug trade have now taken on major roles that significantly affect the United States. While all of the eastern Caribbean is vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers, we have identified Aruba as a major drug-transit country. Aruba is situated on a major drug-transit route, with the vast majority of the cocaine and heroin that transits Aruba destined for the United States.;Cocaine trafficking through Aruba to Puerto Rico continues to involve both transshipment through Aruba and redistribution from Aruba as a hub to other locations. Cocaine is smuggled by ship via Aruba, using commercial vessels, cruise ships, pleasure craft, and fishing boats. In addition, according to the DEA, traffickers use Aruba's free-zone facilities to engage in transit of bulk shipments of cocaine without scrutiny by local officials. A substantial portion of the free-zone's businesses in Aruba are owned and operated by members of the Mansur family, who have been indicted in the United States on charges of conspiracy to launder trafficking proceeds.;Netherlands Antilles. Analysis of the trafficking patterns indicates that there is considerable drug activity taking place around the Netherlands Antilles, especially around St. Maarten. Although, at present, we have only anecdotal information, it is possible that significant quantities of U.S.-bound drugs are involved.;Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. Although I am still concerned about the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin moving through Turkey and neighboring countries to Western Europe along the Balkan Route, there is no clear evidence that this heroin significantly affects the United States. If in the future it is determined that heroin transiting Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, I will add the relevant countries to the "majors" list.;Cuba. Cuba's geographical position astride one of the principal Caribbean trafficking routes to the United States makes it a logical candidate for consideration for the "majors" list. While there continue to be some credible reports that trafficking syndicates use Cuban territory (including waters and airspace) for moving drugs, it has not been confirmed that this traffic carries significant quantities of cocaine or heroin to the United States.;Central Asia. In 1996, the State Department conducted probe efforts in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, traditional poppy-growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These probes did not show significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, I will add such countries to the "majors" list at the appropriate time.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, they do not appear on the list since I have determined, pursuant to FAA section 481(a)(2), that in all cases the cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States, and thus, such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

I have determined that the following major illicit drug producing and/or major transit countries do not meet the standards set forth in section 490(b) for certification: Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria.;In making these determinations, I have considered the factors set forth in section 490 of the Act, based on the information contained in the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report of 1997. Because the performance of each of these countries/dependent territories has differed, I have attached an explanatory statement for each of the countries/dependent territories subject to this determination.;You are hereby authorized and directed to report this determination to the Congress immediately and to publish it in the Federal Register.;WILLIAM J. CLINTON;THE WHITE HOUSE;Washington, February 28, 1997.;STATEMENTS OF EXPLANATION;Aruba;Aruba is a major trafficking and staging point for international narcotics trafficking organizations which transship cocaine and heroin from Colombia, Venezuela and Suriname to the United States and Europe. Its key position near the Venezuelan coast with air and sea links to South America, Europe, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean locations makes it a prime transshipment point. Drug shipments are made primarily via containerized cargo, but commercial airlines and cruise ships are also used. Although USG law enforcement agencies estimate that about 155 mt of cocaine are transshipped through the Caribbean to the United States annually, and that more than 100 international trafficking organizations operate in that region, Aruba seized only about 170 kg of cocaine and about 2 1/2 kg of heroin in 1996.;Money laundering organizations use legitimate companies as fronts to invest in land development and other construction projects. The Government of Aruba's (GOA) Free Trade Zone (FTZ), casinos and resort complexes are reported to be attractive venues for money laundering and smuggling. A joint Dutch-Aruban Commission in 1996 issued recommendations to improve regulation of the FTZ, and invited a U.S. Customs technical expert to help implement those recommendations. Legislation on the FTZ, casinos and off-shore corporations is pending.;Aruba is a part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (GON), and has independent decision-making ability in many drug policy areas. The Kingdom of the Netherlands (GON), a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, has not yet extended it to Aruba. The Aruban legislature is in the final stages of considering comprehensive criminal law reform, expected to be adopted in 1997. The law would create a basis for the Kingdom's extension of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, for expanded investigative powers for local law enforcement, as well as for extradition of nationals subject to service of sentences in Aruba.;The GOA participated with the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles in the establishment of a joint Kingdom-Caribbean Coast Guard, designed to patrol the Kingdom's Caribbean coastal waters to interdict drug shipments. The GOA established money transaction monitoring entities to review unusual transactions in the banking sector. Aruban law enforcement officials participated in USG-sponsored training courses for drug enforcement during 1996. The GOA has taken limited steps to punish corrupt officials, and replaced senior police and justice officials in Aruba.;Corruption is a problem that hinders effective efforts against international narcotics traffickers. A joint Netherlands Antilles and Aruba court denied a USG extradition request for a Colombian narcotics trafficker in 1996. Despite these problems, Aruba generally cooperated with the USG to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;The Bahamas;Over the past ten years, successful combined U.S./Bahamian counternarcotics efforts have dramatically reduced the amount of cocaine and marijuana transiting The Bahamas en route to the United States. This downward trend has continued over the last several years. Nevertheless, significant quantities of illicit drugs continue to pass through The Bahamas. The Bahamas is also a dynamic financial services center and a tax haven with bank secrecy laws, which are both factors conducive to money laundering. Some marijuana is grown in The Bahamas, but the country is not a major drug producer.;The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (GCOB) vigorously strives to combat drug trafficking and is extraordinarily cooperative with USG counterdrug efforts. The first country to ratify the 1988 UN Drug Convention, The Bahamas took further steps during 1996 to implement it. Strong anti-money laundering legislation and implementing regulations entered into force in 1996. During the year, the GCOB continued its successful efforts to strengthen its justice system, with assistance from the USG.;U.S. and Bahamian law enforcement officials continued to work closely together to apprehend drug traffickers. Domestic drug abuse remains a problem, but the number of new drug users has declined notably since the mid1980s. Over the past several years, The Bahamas has prosecuted and convicted some middle and low-level officials on charges of narcotics corruption. The GCOB is also making some headway in its efforts to forfeit and dispose of trafficker assets.;Although enormous progress has been made, more can be done. In coming years, The Bahamas should continue to improve the effectiveness with which its justice system handles drug cases, further emphasize forfeiture of trafficker assets and effectively enforce its new anti-money laundering controls.;Bolivia;The Government of Bolivia sustained an intense counternarcotics effort again in 1996, cooperating fully with the USG, and took adequate steps toward full compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Bolivia's coca crop is the third largest in the world, behind Peru and Colombia, but the high yield of Bolivian coca makes Bolivia second only to Peru in terms of the production of cocaine alkaloid. The vast majority of the coca for cocaine production is cultivated in Bolivia's Chapare region. Coca growers produce cocaine base in rudimentary laboratories, then sell it to more sophisticated organizations which convert cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride. Bolivia is believed to be the world's second leading producer of refined cocaine hydrochloride.;During 1996, the Government of Bolivia (GOB) eradicated over 7,500 hectares of coca in the Chapare—the highest level of eradication since 1990. Despite the GOB's commitment to this program, eradication reduced Bolivia's coca crop by only one percent, as new coca cultivation, both within and outside of the Chapare, almost offset eradication. Total potential cocaine production in 1996 declined by an estimated 10 percent, however, from 240 metric tons in 1995 to some 215 metric tons of cocaine HCl. New coca does not become harvestable—and capable of producing the cocaine alkaloid—for two years.;In order to confront the problem of new planting, the government launched late in 1996 an expanded campaign to detect and destroy new coca and seedbeds. For the first time, the GOB also fully applied the letter of its own law, arresting several peasants for planting new coca.;The Minister of Justice produced a package of legislative reforms, designed to modernize Bolivia's criminal justice sector. Among the reforms were strong anti-money laundering provisions. The government presented the package to the Bolivian Congress in January 1997, and is seeking passage before the June 1997 presidential elections. In addition, a new extradition treaty between the United States and Bolivia, which allows for the extradition of Bolivian nationals, entered into force in November 1996.;Overall cocaine base and HCl seizures increased in 1996 compared to 1995, and HCl seizures in the second half of the year increased dramatically. The government established a Chemical Control Directorate. Meanwhile, an expanded and increasingly effective Chemical Police Unit, aided by counterdrug forces in the Chapare, made chemical seizures well above 1995 levels. The government's Seized Asset Directorate, created in December 1995, began operations, while asset seizures increased by some 36 percent over 1995.;In the coming year, the GOB must work to eliminate and prevent new coca cultivation, fully applying the Law 1008 prohibition on new planting, and reduce coca cultivation in the Chapare by at least 10 percent. The GOB should press for the passage and rapid implementation of a money laundering law along with a revised Code of Criminal Procedures. Faced with an increasingly sophisticated group of Bolivian trafficking organizations, the GOB's enforcement strategy must more effectively target cocaine HCl processing and trafficking organizations, as well as Chapare-based cocaine base laboratories. In addition, we expect the GOB to ensure that the Blue Devils Riverine Task Force can fully exercise its drug enforcement authority and product results consistent with its resources.;Brazil;International narcotics traffickers use Brazil to transship cocaine primarily from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia to the United States and Europe. Brazil serves as an increasingly significant transit route for air shipments of cocaine base from Peru to cocaine labs in Colombia. Cocaine also transits the country by river and overland routes. Law enforcement agencies estimate that ten to twenty mt of cocaine transit Brazil annually, of which Brazilian authorities seized about three mt of cocaine in 1996, a decline from last year's almost six mt. Despite the decline, Brazil fully cooperated with the USG to advance the goals of bilateral agreements and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;In 1996, the area of Brazil bordering Peru was heavily used as a staging area for air shipments of cocaine destined for the United States. Brazilian trafficking organizations reportedly provided fuel and airstrips for illicit trafficking purposes.;To address this threat, Brazilian authorities destroyed several airstrips, and commendably repeated operations when traffickers rebuilt those cratered airstrips. In a strong commitment to regional cooperation, Brazilian police cooperated with Peruvian and Colombian police to deter trafficking in the tri-border area between their respective countries.;Focussing on the maritime trafficking problems in Brazil's major seaports, which function as conduits for cocaine shipped to the United States, Brazil participated in one U.S. Customs port assessment visit to the major ports of Rio de Janeiro and nearby Santos. Brazil also tightened enforcement over its chemical companies.;Brazil entered into an agreement with the USG to train police-prosecutorjudge task forces to bolster the Government of Brazil's (GOB) counter-narcotics effort and to enhance coordination between judges, prosecutors and police. Corruption is a problem in mid and lower levels of the DPF that hinders effective enforcement efforts to control drug trafficking through Brazil.;Authorities disrupted the Saavedra-Shapiama Organization, which trafficked cocaine from the Amazon region to the United States. With USG assistance, Brazilian authorities in good faith continue to investigate this and other narcotics trafficking organizations in the Amazon region. In May 1996, the Brazilian Senate approved the Amazon Surveillance System (SIVAM). SIVAM is a detection and monitoring system that will be used to protect the Amazon region, in part against illicit narcotics trafficking.;Although the Brazilian government did not sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) that would have renewed counternarcotics cooperation with the USG in 1996, the GOB has demonstrated a strong interest in continuing its counternarcotics relationship with the USG. The almost $1 million of 1996 counternarcotics funding meant for Brazil instead funded the Organization of American States Anti-Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD). In addition to demonstrating a commitment to cooperate further with the USG on counternarcotics, Brazil participated in important multilateral counter-narcotics initiatives, including an OAS/CICAD meeting in Uruguay.;Other efforts point of Brazil's achievements in 1996. It proposed a National Drug Enforcement Plan in 1996. It also hosted several meetings of the of the mini-Dublin Group in Brasilia to coordinate counternarcotics assistance from major donors, primarily European nations. Demand reduction and other multilateral efforts have successfully raised the profile of the danger of drug trafficking and abuse in Brazil. Although bank secrecy remained a formidable obstacle in the battle against money laundering, and money laundering occurred in Brazil's banks and exchange houses, in 1996 the congress initiated debate on a bill to counter money laundering.;Cambodia;In 1996, Cambodia made significant efforts toward addressing drug trafficking and transit problems, which the Royal Government of Cambodia has acknowledged. There is a significant flow of heroin transiting Cambodia which affects the U.S. and other countries. The National Assembly passed a comprehensive counternarcotics law on December 3, 1996. The statute, drafted with UNDCP assistance and advice, includes tough anti-money laundering provisions and commits the government to becoming a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Other measures taken by the RGC, either separately or in cooperation with the U.S. and other governments and international organizations, include reorganizing its ill-trained and equipped 900-person National Anti-Narcotics Unit into a more effective 40-person National Anti-Drug Unit, participating in UNDCP conferences, and seeking other avenues to broaden cooperation with surrounding countries and the international community. Cambodian drug interdiction efforts resulted in the seizure of 40 kilograms of heroin and the arrest of 12 heroin couriers working for Nigerian trafficking organizations. The RGC also continued a program of marijuana eradication.;The skeletal nature of Cambodia's law enforcement infrastructure, coupled with an impoverished economy, continues to impede efforts as assembling comprehensive information about the drug trade in and through the country. These weaknesses have also made the task of providing appropriate assistance more critical and, at the same time, more difficult. The single most important issue Cambodia faces with regard to its drug trafficking problem, however, is the issue of drug-related corruption. After the publication in 1995 of allegations tying key political and business figures to the drug trade, the RGC publicly called for information which would aid in the prosecution of any such person. There have, however, been no results yet reported in connection with these charges. The U.S. will be looking for efforts to deal vigorously with drug-related corruption, which would otherwise eventually undermine Cambodia's credibility on the issue of narcotics control. USG efforts to assist Cambodia in building stronger law enforcement and judicial institutions are based on the premise that the upper levels of the RGC will thus have available the appropriate means for dealing with the issue.;China;China continues to play a key role as a major transit route for Southeast Asian heroin destined for the U.S. and other Western markets. Addiction and violent crime associated with China's proximity to the Golden Triangle and its flow of narcotics continue to engage the attention of Chinese authorities. In April 1996, China's Ministry of Public Security began a nationwide anti-crime campaign called "Strike Hard," which placed special emphasis on drug interdiction efforts: opium seizures in the first ten months of 1996 were up 26 percent over all of 1995, and heroin seizures in the first ten months of 1996 were up 47 percent over the entire amount seized in 1995. China continues to be an active participant in the United Nations Drug Control Program and in 1996 signed mutual legal assistance treaties, with specific attention to narcotics trafficking, with Russia, Mexico and Pakistan. It is also a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Counternarcotics and law enforcement cooperation with the United States continues to be uneven, although senior U.S. and Chinese officials have publicly recognized the common interest in enhanced cooperation. Lower level officials continue to express a desire to expand cooperation, and working-level dialogue and information sharing have improved and expanded in some respects. Chinese officials participated in a two-week regional cooperation seminar in Bangkok conducted by DEA and in a program to help law enforcement officials detect and prevent illegal transshipments of precursor chemicals. U.S. Customs representatives also taught interdiction techniques to Chinese officials in Sichuan Province. But China in 1996 also denied, "for now," a USG request to be allowed to open a joint DEA/FBI office at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.;China's continued strong stand against crime and official corruption has been widely publicized. Chinese leaders and law enforcement authorities have recognized that rapid economic growth has contributed to the spread of corruption, including among lower level officials. Penalties for such transgressions are severe and include execution.;China is a major chemical producer. The interest PRC officials have shown in techniques for controlling sales and shipments of chemical precursors indicates growing recognition of China's role as a target for criminals seeking to illegally procure or divert such chemicals. China's recognition of its susceptibility to money laundering also appears to be growing, but domestic mechanisms for assessing and addressing the problem are only beginning to catch up to the challenge.;Dominican Republic;In 1996, the Dominican Republic's attention was focused on election year politics. As a result, although the out-going government cooperated with counternarcotics operations, it has left the new administration with unresolved, long-term narcotics-related issues and an environment of public concern about corruption. Despite the absence of a master plan, the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) remains deeply committed to the war against narcotics trafficking and consumption.;Following its installation in August 1996, the Fernandez administration made an anti-corruption agenda and judicial reform high priorities of the GODR. However, the GODR lacks effective enforcement mechanisms to eliminate the corruption which undermines the country's fragile democratic institutions. Additionally, the country's largely unpatrolled coast, its porous border with Haiti, and poorly paid and under-equipped police and military make it attractive to Dominican and Colombian drug transshipment organizations and domestic drug traffickers. The majority of Dominican s condemn the use of illegal drugs and support GODR efforts to combat narcotics trafficking, drug consumption levels are considered low.;The Government of the Dominican Republic cooperated fully with the United States Government on counternarcotics objectives and goals. Among the GODR's accomplishments was the arrest of the Cali cartel's Rolando Florian-Feliz, the DR's most wanted narcotics trafficker.;Due to the absence of effective government supervision of exchange houses or remittance operations and the presence of large cash flows which could hide money laundering activity, it is believed that narcotics money continues to be laundered in the Dominican Republic. Money laundering is not likely to diminish until the GODR aggressively implements the money laundering legislation. Many Dominican s who have committed serious crimes in the United States continue to find refuge in the Dominican Republic, since local law bars extradition of nationals. While 1996 negotiations for a new extradition treaty with the former government did not reach a successful conclusion, the USG is currently assessing a resumption of talks with the Fernandez administration.;Neither the GODR itself nor senior government officials encourage, facilitate, or engage in drug trafficking or money laundering as a matter of government policy. No evidence exists that senior government officials are involved in drug distribution or money laundering. No senior government official has been indicted for drug-related corruption in 1996.;Ecuador;International narcotics traffickers from Colombia and Peru intensified their efforts to transship cocaine and coca base through Ecuador. Trafficking organizations ship about 20–40 metric tons (mt) of coca base from Peru through Ecuador to Colombia for refining into finished cocaine, and about 30–50 mt of cocaine through Ecuador to the United States and Europe. Ecuador seized almost nine mt of cocaine in 1996.;Traffickers continued to transship cocaine overland and by river, and to smuggle chemicals into Ecuador via the Pan American Highway and Ecuador's extensive river network, sometimes committing armed robberies of truck drivers transporting chemicals from petroleum companies in Ecuador's jungle region.;Ecuadoran authorities responded commendably to counter traffickers, placing emphasis on Guayaquil as a favored cocaine transshipment point. Authorities made a nearly seven mt seizure of cocaine from a fishing vessel, the Don Celso, and had it returned from international waters to search it in Guayaquil. Traffickers had loaded the cocaine into the fuel tanks of the 150-ft. fishing vessel.;The Ecuador National Policy (ENP), with USG assistance, identified a major cocaine processing facility just west of Quito in a town called Santo Domingo de los Colorados. Authorities dismantled the lab, but many said it demonstrated a shift in trafficker activity from neighboring countries to Ecuador.;The Government of Ecuador (GOE) demonstrated its commitment to regional counternarcotics cooperation efforts. In an unprecedented law enforcement cooperation effort with Peru, Ecuadoran police deported to Peru Willer Alvarado Linares, a.k.a. "Champa," a Peruvian drug kingpin with close ties to the Cali Cartel. With USG assistance, the ENP dismantled a major drug trafficking organization in Ecuador reportedly run by a Cali-connected trafficker, Jose Castrillon Henao. Ecuadoran authorities continued the prosecution of Jorge Hugo Reyes Torres, a jailed drug kingpin, also tied to Cali.;Although police-military cooperation, maritime cooperation, and inadequate money laundering legislation remained problems, GOE officials made a good faith effort to resolve these issues. The GOE participated in drug enforcement and customs training courses, continued some information-sharing efforts, and attended a money laundering seminar.;The Ecuadoran Supreme Court entered into an agreement with the USG on administration of justice. The USG bought five computers and a laser printer in support of Ecuador's ambitious judicial reform effort. Allegations of corruption in the judiciary and in other branches of the government plagued the former Bacaram administration, and now plague the current administration of interim President Alarcon, hindering effective counter-narcotics efforts.;Despite these problems, Ecuadoran government officials demonstrate continued interest in working with the USG to address more effectively narcotics trafficking problems that threaten to erode democratic institutions. Ecuador is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and has bilateral agreements with the USG. Ecuador has fully cooperated with the USG to advance the goals and objectives of these agreements.;Guatemala;Despite the political distractions of the ongoing peace process, Guatemala continued to cooperate fully with U.S. counternarcotics goals and objectives. Law enforcement cooperation between Guatemala and the United States has been excellent. With USG support, Guatemalan government (GOG) counternarcotics officials seized almost four metric tons of cocaine, a significant increase over previous years.;GOG experts estimate that at least one out of four Guatemalan adults suffers from some sort of chemical dependency, principally alcohol abuse. Illicit drug use has not been effectively documented, but GOG officials believe it has increased steadily since 1990 and contributes to the extremely high level of violence in the country, especially in the capital city.;The Department of Anti-Narcotics Operations (DOAN), the country's principal counternarcotics organization, fully cooperated with USG agencies on information-sharing, joint operations, and special investigations targeting international drug trafficking networks. Also in 1996, a major corruption ring centered on customs tax evasion and extortion was uncovered, giving the GOG further impetus to criminalize money laundering and develop the capability to investigate suspect financial transactions.;Recent information indicates that significant quantities of precursor chemicals, mostly ephedrine, are being diverted through Guatemala to Mexico and the United States. The government has not yet taken steps to halt that traffic, which is not currently illegal in Guatemala. The GOG has, however, requested and will receive USG technical assistance on how to combat this illicit trafficking. In early 1997, Guatemala hosted a regional seminar to address the problem of the control and regulation of precursor chemicals.;The GOG does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions. In addition, no senior government official facilitates or encourages the illicit production or distribution of such drugs or substances or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.;Haiti;Haiti continues to cooperate with U.S. counternarcotics goals and objectives. The Government of Haiti (GOH) confronts a staggering array of issues that compete for the attention of its already stretched professional and managerial talent and consequently impedes rapid progress on counter-narcotics issues. Despite these obstacles, the GOH made definite progress in counternarcotics issues in 1996.;The GOH began to reform its existing narcotics laws and to develop a national narcotics plan and money laundering legislation. With USG support, a Haitian Coast Guard (HCG) unit was established, a Counternarcotics Unit (CNU) was trained, and new chiefs for both units were installed. The changeover in leadership of the CNU proved particularly time-consuming and, despite sincere efforts, the CNU was not functioning in its permanent quarters at the airport by the end of 1996. Nevertheless, the commitment of the Haitian National Police (HNP) leadership to maintain high standards of performance within these two units is notable.;The HCG began operating in August 1996 and scored two major cocaine seizures amounting to 938 kgs. in its first two months of operation. The interdiction and maritime boarding experience in these two operations represented a training opportunity that contributed to the HCG's ability to eventually conduct independent operations.;The USG has made a strong commitment to assist Haiti in establishing stable democratic institutions. As a part of this effort, the USG intends to work with the GOH towards conclusion of a bilateral maritime agreement, and to continue its efforts to assist the GOH with its narcotics-related agenda and legal reform programs. The USG will also assist the HNP in establishing regional law enforcement contacts and continue to provide support for both the HCG and the CNU.;In 1996, the GOH continued to give USG officials high-level assurances of its commitment to drug control, and those assurances have been supported by concrete progress in establishing Haitian counter-drug institutions. However, Haiti still has a number of major goals to achieve before it will be able to take significant, independent action in counternarcotics.;Hong Kong;Hong Kong's role as a money laundering base for the international drug trade continues to grow, while its role as a transit point for drugs appears to have lessened. There were no drug seizures in the United States in the first 10 months of 1996 unequivocally linking Hong Kong to the U.S. as a transit point for drugs. The overall pattern of drug trafficking in the region, however, continues to point to Hong Kong as a key transshipment point for drugs destined for the U.S. and other Western markets.;Hong Kong authorities continued to strengthen the legislative framework for combatting narcotics trafficking. They extended licensing controls to an additional 21 precursor chemicals, introduced implementing legislation for bilateral extradition agreements and proposed legislation establishing heavier sentences for drug traffickers who target the young. On December 20, 1996, the U.S. and Hong Kong signed an agreement for the surrender of fugitive offenders (an extradition agreement) and the two sides have initialled a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement that will expand the basis for mutual legal assistance over a wide range of criminal activity, including that currently covered by a Bilateral Narcotics Agreement, which will be terminated by its terms on June 30, 1997.;Hong Kong's mature and experienced law enforcement structure is characterized by dedication and no reported narcotics-related corruption among senior officials. Cooperation between the United States and Hong Kong on matters relating to drug trafficking and money laundering continues to be excellent.;India;India is the sole producer of licit opium gum for the pharmaceutical industry, a significant cultivator of opium poppies in remote regions of northwest and northeast India and a transit country for opiates from both Southwest and Southeast Asia. Controls over the licit opium industry have been continuously tightened for the past five years but, due to the method of production, some diversion probably continues. The well-developed transportation infrastructure in India, combined with porous borders from neighboring source countries, has made India an attractive transit country for traffickers.;As a licit producer of opium, India must meet an additional certification requirement. In accordance with Section 490(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act, it must maintain licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than those consistent with licit market demand and take adequate steps to prevent significant diversion of its licit cultivation and production into illicit markets and to prevent illicit cultivation and production.;In 1996, India continued to take steps to curtail diversion of licit opium, which remains a concern. The minimum qualifying yield (MQY) for relicensing to cultivate opium poppy was raised from 46 to 48 kilograms per hectare in most growing areas, and offenses related to cultivation and embezzlement of opium are now on par with other trafficking crimes. Sentences of up to 20 years' imprisonment can be imposed.;Although the Government of India (GOI) did not agree to direct USG participation in the 1996 opium yield survey, it did allow U.S. scientists to observe the survey and to work with Indian scientists to include new parameters in future opium yield surveys. A comprehensive opium yield survey verifies data on crop yields, establishes practicable levels of MQY, and better quantifies diversion.;Indian opium gum, a principal source of the baine and other alkaloids essential to certain pharmaceuticals, is in demand by U.S. and other pharmaceutical firms. India once again increased opium poppy cultivation because of the pharmaceutical demand and a desire to establish once again a stockpile against a crop disaster. Opium production rose to 849 mt in 1996 from 833 mt in 1995 (all measures at ten percent moisture).;India has illicit opium poppy cultivation, primarily in areas such as Jammu and Kashmir, where GOI control is challenged by insurgent groups. USG remote sensing in 1996 indicated illicit cultivation on 3,400 hectares, with a theoretical yield of 47 metric tons of opium, a decrease from the previous year's estimate. However, despite efforts by the GOI based on suspect coordinates provided by the USG, it was able to find only small areas of poppy cultivation.;The GOI continues to make progress in controlling the production and export of precursor chemicals. The GOI has a cooperative relationship with the DEA, especially on precursor chemical issues, and has agreed not to allow any shipment unless DEA issues a letter of non-objection. Trafficking in illegally produced methaqualone (mandrax), a popular drug in Africa, is still believed to be a major problem, although seizures fell in 1996.;Authorities have had limited success in prosecuting major narcotics trafficking organizations because of the lack of enforcement funding and weaknesses in the investigations infrastructure. The GOI stresses cooperation among law enforcement entities. India cooperates in "controlled deliveries" that have resulted in arrests in six countries.;The USG receives reports of narcotics-linked corruption, but cannot independently verify the extent. No senior-level politician or bureaucrat has been accused of narcotics-related corruption.;India is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and Indian officials state that it is drafting legislation needed on asset seizures and money laundering. In the meantime, its law enforcement agencies are without the tools to achieve fully the Convention's goals and objectives.;India fulfilled the requirements of FAA Section 490(c) to maintain licit production and stockpiles at levels no higher than consistent with market demand. It also continued to take steps to reduce diversion from the licit crop, although not agreeing to use a crop yield survey as the basis for setting the minimum qualifying yield for license renewal. The GOI, upon receipt of information on suspected illicit crops, acted promptly to seek out and destroy the plots. For 1996, India's efforts meet the additional certification requirements of FAA Section 490(c). The United States continues to work with the GOI in the following areas: taking effective action against major narcotics trafficking syndicates and kingpins, implementing effective measures on money laundering and asset seizure, permitting U.S. participation in opium crop surveys, and eradicating illicit poppy cultivation.;Jamaica;Jamaica produces marijuana and is a significant cocaine transit country. The Government of Jamaica (GOJ) made some progress during 1996 to achieve the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to which it became a party in December 1995. In December 1996, the Jamaican parliament passed a money laundering law, which, although somewhat limited in scope in that it criminalizes only the laundering of the proceeds of drug-related crime, is the beginning of a money laundering control regime. Although the GOJ has yet to prosecute asset forfeiture cases under the relevant 1994 act, it did establish a special unit which is currently investigating two such cases. Action on drafting a precursor chemical bill was deferred to 1997. GOJ–USG negotiations on a maritime counternarcotics cooperation agreement, which commenced in 1996, had been impeded by Jamaica's declaration of exclusive law enforcement authority in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In December 1996, the GOJ withdrew its EEZ declaration, and negotiations resumed in February 1997, in a spirit of cooperation and willingness to conclude an agreement. Although the rate of extraditions declined markedly, from six in 1995 to one (under a waiver of extradition) in 1996, partly attributable to new Jamaican legal procedures regarding appeals, the GOJ expelled or deported to the U.S. eight U.S.-citizen fugitives during 1996. However, a sizeable number of extradition requests to the GOJ remain open.;According to DEA, Jamaican police counternarcotics cooperation in 1996 remained at the high levels of 1995, but drug arrests, cocaine seizures, and cannabis eradication fell somewhat below the goals and objectives of our bilateral letter of agreement (LOA). Signed by the GOJ and USG, the 1996 LOA set an objective of significantly increasing drug arrests and cocaine and heroin seizures. Drug-related arrests in 1996 (3,263) were down slightly from the 1995 level (3,705). Cocaine seizures in 1996 (236 kg) were also reduced from the 1995 level (571 kg). Heroin seizures increased slightly in 1996 (1 kg) compared to 1995 (zero kg). Marijuana seizures, on the other hand, increased significantly (52.99 mt in 1996, compared to 37.20 mt in 1995), bolstered by one very large seizure late in 1996. The 1996 LOA set an eradication goal of 800 hectares of cannabis. During 1996, 473 hectares were eradicated, compared to 695 hectares in 1995, with the area under cultivation estimated to be the same both years. U.S.-provided helicopters used to assist eradication efforts were grounded for safety reasons for part of the year.;Jamaica's National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA) continued its demand reduction efforts, becoming increasingly self-reliant and prominent. Jamaica's national drug control strategy has been drafted and is awaiting government approval for implementation. The GOJ has not formally charged any senior government official with drug-related activity, but several Jamaican policemen and court employees have been arrested and charged on drug and drug-related charges. The Jamaican media continues to report allegations of drug-related corruption among public officials including the police.;In 1997, in order to fully carry out the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the GOJ needs to strengthen its money laundering control law, pass a chemical control law, and continue to modernize its full range of drug control laws and penalties. Jamaica's greatest challenge will be decisive implementation of such laws. The GOJ also needs to conclude a maritime cooperation agreement, intensify its effort to respond to U.S. extradition requests, prosecute asset forfeiture cases, and increases the conviction rate of those arrested for drug-related crimes. On the bilateral level, in order to make better use of U.S. counter-drug and anti-crime assistance, Jamaica needs to intensify its drug law enforcement and marijuana eradication efforts, tighten the security of its export shipments to keep drugs out of them, and participate fully in combined maritime counterdrug operations. In addition, the GOJ needs to formally approve its national drug control strategy and systematically implement it. The GOJ should take decisive measures to root out drug-related corruption among public officials which undermines drug control efforts.;Laos;Laos is still a distant third, after Burma and Afghanistan, in world production of illicit opium. The 1995/96 growing cycle saw an estimated increase of 11% in opium production over the 1994/95 level, this was a little over 50% of the record level set in 1989. Regions of Laos covered by USG-and UNDCP-funded crop substitution projects, however, saw only low levels of poppy cultivation. In May, the Lao Government passed an amendment to its existing drug control law which banned opium production and increased penalties for trafficking. It believes, however, that rigorous enforcement of the provision outlawing opium production requires adequate programs to provide alternative sources of income to farmers and continues to press its case for adequate assistance from the international community to enable it to fully implement its anti-narcotics action plan.;Reservations about its ability to enforce the legislation banning opium production notwithstanding, the Government of Laos continued to participate actively in regional counternarcotics efforts. It signed a UNDCP-sponsored project document on regional law enforcement cooperation and hosted a regional working level conference on the trafficking of precursor chemicals and the involvement of West African drug traffickers in Southeast Asia. Bilateral cooperation with the United States, however, remained at the center of Laos' counternarcotics endeavors. USG funding of the Houaphan crop control project continued, and the Lao formed two additional Special Counternarcotics Units, one in Savannakhet and one in Bokeo, with USG assistance. In November, the Lao Government approved the assignment of a DEA representative to the American Embassy in Vientiane. Overall Lao cooperation with the USG on counternarcotics matters remains excellent, while low-level corruption is assumed to exist, there is little to indicate high-level or systematic drug-related corruption in the Lao government. Laos' vigorous enforcement over the coming year of its newly enacted laws outlawing opium production and increasing the penalties for drug trafficking will be an important signal of its long-term commitment to controlling its drug problem.;Malaysia;Malaysia is a transit country for heroin bound for the U.S., Europe and other destinations. Malaysia's anti-trafficking laws include a mandatory death sentence for convicted traffickers. Law enforcement authorities are pressing for enactment of a conspiracy law to enable prosecution of traffickers who escape prosecution under existing criminal statutes. In addition, the Government of Malaysia has instituted a number of bureaucratic measures, including the establishment of a new interagency group headed by the Prime Minister, to bolster enforcement and demand reduction activities. Malaysia is also a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Cooperation between Malaysian law enforcement officials and DEA continued to expand in 1996. Negotiation of a bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between Malaysia and the U.S. is proceeding smoothly. Both governments hope to conclude the treaty in 1997. Malaysia and the United States also cooperated on drug abuse prevention (demand reduction) programs, many of them directed at rehabilitation center inmates. These programs are of particular concern to the Malaysian Government in view of rising addiction rates. Existing rehabilitation centers have also been a focal point of the lower-level narcotics-related corruption which is known to exist: guard and treatment center employees have sold narcotics to inmates. The Malaysian Government has proposed an amendment to the Dangerous Drugs Act to strengthen the penalty for such activities.;Malaysia is also beginning to look toward money laundering as a vulnerable point in its overall legal and institutional structure. Senior government officials have publicly expressed concern about possible misuse of Malaysia's offshore financial center, Labuan, to launder money. Malaysia has now endorsed the Commonwealth Secretariat's efforts to produce model anti-money laundering legislation.;Mexico;The Government of Mexico's (GOM) 1996 counter-drug effort produced encouraging results and notable progress in bilateral cooperation. President Zedillo has declared the major drug trafficking organizations, and the corruption they foster within governmental structures, to be Mexico's principal national security threat. He has intensified the country's counter-drug effort, in keeping with international human rights norms, both through legal reforms and operationally, through the expanded participation of the nation's military services.;Drug seizures and arrests increased in 1996. Mexican authorities seized 23.8 mt of cocaine, 383 kgs of heroin, 1015 mt of marijuana, 171.7 kgs of methamphetamine and 6.7 mt of ephedrine (its chemical precursor), and destroyed 20 drug labs. Police arrested 11,283 suspects on drug-related charges. Authorities arrested a several major traffickers: Juan Garcia Abrego, Gulf cartel leader and one of the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" fugitive, Jose Luis Pereira Salas, linked to the Cali and Juarez cartels, and Manuel Rodriguez Lopez, linked to the Castrillon maritime smuggling organization.;The Mexican Congress passed two critical pieces of legislation which have armed the GOM with a whole new arsenal of weapons to use to combat money laundering, chemical diversion and organized crime. The GOM established organized crime task forces in key locations in northern and western Mexico in cooperation with U.S. law enforcement. In an effort to confront widespread corruption within the nation's law enforcement agencies, former Attorney General Lozano dismissed over 1250 federal police officers and technical personnel for corruption or incompetence, although some have been rehired, and the GOM indicted two former senior GOM officials and a current Undersecretary of Tourism. He also sought to expand cooperation with the United States and other governments.;The United States and Mexico established the High-Level Contact Group on Narcotics Control (HLCG) to explore joint solutions to the shared drug threat and to coordinate bilateral anti-drug efforts. The HLCG met three times during 1996 and its technical working groups met throughout the year. Under the aegis of the HLCG, the two governments developed a joint assessment of the narcotics threat posed to both countries which will be used as the basis for a joint counter-drug strategy.;U.S.-Mexican bilateral cooperation on drug law enforcement continued to improve in 1996, particularly in the areas of money laundering, mutual legal assistance, and criminal investigations. The USG provided training, technical, and material support to personnel of the Office of the Mexican Attorney General (PGR), the National Institute to Combat Drugs (INCD), the Mexican Treasury, and the Mexican armed forces. The Government of Mexico established the important precedent of extraditing Mexican nationals to the United States under the provision of Mexico's extradition law permitting this in "exceptional circumstances." This paves the way for further advances in bringing fugitives to justice. Both governments returned record numbers of fugitives in 1996.;Even with positive results, and good cooperation with the U.S. and other governments, the problems which Mexico faces remain daunting. The Zedillo Administration has taken important beginning steps against the major drug cartels in Mexico, and towards more effective cooperation with the United States and other international partners, but the strongest groups, such as the Juarez and Tijuana cartels, have yet to be effectively confronted. The level of narcotics corruption is very serious, reaching into the very senior levels of Mexico's drug law enforcement forces, as witnessed by the February 1997 arrest of the recently-appointed national counter-narcotics coordinator. President Zedillo acted courageously to remove him as soon as the internal Mexican investigation revealed the problem, but this has been a set-back for Mexico's anti-drug effort, and for bilateral cooperation.;Mexican police, military personnel, prosecutors, and the courts need additional resources, training and other support to perform the important and dangerous tasks ahead of them. Progress in establishing controls on money laundering and chemical diversion must be further enhanced and implemented. New capabilities need to be institutionalized. Above all, the GOM will have to take system-wide action against corruption and other abuses of official authority through enhanced screening personnel in sensitive positions and putting into place ongoing integrity controls.;While there are still serious problems, and a number of areas in which the USG would like to see further progress, the two governments have agreed on the parameters of a joint approach to combat the narcotics threat, and are at work on developing this strategy. The drug issue will remain one of the top issues in the bilateral agenda and will be one of the main issues discussed during President Clinton's planned visit to Mexico in April.;Panama;Panama continued to cooperate with the United States to achieve our counternarcotics goals and objectives in 1996. The Government of Panama's (GOP) achievements in 1996 included an eradication campaign which resulted in the elimination of the country's fledgling coca cultivation and significant damage to marijuana cultivation, aggressive and effective prevention and education campaigns, and the first-ever conviction of a major money launderer from the Colon Free Zone. In one of the region's most significant arrests, the GOP captured the Cali cartel's primary maritime smuggler, Jose Castrillon Henao, who is scheduled for trial in 1997. The USG provided six helicopters to the GOP in late 1996, for the express purpose of combatting narcotics.;Following up on full congressional certification for the past two years, and spurred on by last year's legislation tightening money laundering regulations, the Government of Panama made Latin America's first financial analysis unit operational, resulting in the presentation of patterns of money laundering to the GOP's National Security Council for eventual prosecution.;Panama continues to be a major financial and commercial center ideally positioned for narcotics smuggling and illicit financial transactions. Money laundering remains the primary problem in Panama. Local factors facilitating money laundering include bank secrecy, the Colon Free Zone, inadequate controls on cash and commodity imports/exports, lax incorporation regulations, and a dollar-based economy. The GOP has taken definite steps to address these problems, including the start-up of a financial analysis unit and the establishment of computerized data bases for tracking financial movements in the Colon Free Zone. The GOP also established a financial investigative unit which will prepare cases of money laundering for prosecution. Armed with more effective legal, policy, and institutional underpinnings, the GOP expects to counter money laundering activities more successfully in 1997.;The GOP needs to continue to crack down on both money laundering and drug trafficking, follow through on reports of suspicious transactions by arresting and convicting major money launderers, improve interdiction capabilities, and make effective use of the financial analysis unit.;Paraguay;The government of Juan Carlos Wasmosy cooperated fully with the United States in 1996. Government of Paraguay (GOP) anti-drug efforts improved substantially, and the government took adequate measures to further its compliance with the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Scarce resources, public corruption, and an only partially-reformed legal system remain obstacles to more effective counternarcotics action, but the GOP has demonstrated its commitment to combatting the drug trade.;President Wasmosy appointed an activist Director to the National Antidrug Executive Secretariat (SENAD) in June, who immediately sought a closer, more productive relationship with the United States and with Paraguay's neighbors. Assuming the post with a reputation for honesty, Carlos Ayala made cocaine trafficking groups the SENAD's top priority. He has removed anti-drug officers implicated in corrupt practices, and focused Paraguay's investigative resources on Paraguay's top traffickers. Under Ayala's leadership, SENAD developed a comprehensive national anti-drug strategy, which President Wasmosy presented to the nation in late fall. Ayala also launched a new approach to combat drug abuse.;The Paraguayan Congress, with strong support from the executive branch, in December enacted an anti-money laundering law consistent with international standards. SENAD Chief Ayala initiated a revision of Paraguay's anti-narcotics statute which would explicitly authorize undercover operations and controlled deliveries. The GOP is pushing for congressional approval of the amendment early in 1997.;The SENAD continued large-scale marijuana eradication operations, worked closely with DEA on training and equipping the Anti-narcotics Police (DINAR) Special Intelligence and Investigative Unit, and assessed the threat of precursor chemical trafficking and diversion in Paraguay. Meanwhile, on the international front, the GOP signed agreements with Brazil and Argentina to cooperate in combatting trans-border criminal activity, including drug trafficking, and Paraguayan officials initiated working-level coordination meetings with counterparts in these countries. The SENAD also agreed with Bolivian counterparts to share intelligence and to conduct joint operations.;In 1997, the GOP should secure passage of a strengthened anti-drug law and begin to forcefully implement its new money laundering statute. The USG will assist the GOP in creating an interagency financial crimes investigative unit. Paraguay also must improve its ability to investigate drug and other organized crime groups in the tri-border area, particularly in the cities of Pedro Juan Caballero and Ciudad del Este, and we expect the GOP to pursue key drug trafficking and corruption cases in the coming year.;Peru;Peru is the world's largest coca producer. The USG has consistently urged the Government of Peru (GOP) to fulfill its signatory obligations under the 1961 Single Convention and the 1988 UN Drug Convention, particularly with regard to reducing its coca production. In 1996, the GOP cooperated fully with the United States in efforts to achieve the goals and objectives of the UN drug conventions. Last year, total coca cultivation decreased by 18 percent, from 115,300 hectares in 1995 to 94,400 hectares in 1996. The level of cultivation in Peru was the lowest since 1986.;Contributing to the reduction was widespread abandonment of coca fields by farmers due to depressed cocaine base prices. Cocaine base prices were held below the break-even point by Peruvian National Police and Peruvian Air Force actions against the narcotics trafficking transportation infrastructure. During 1996, the joint USG–GOP alternative development program established a foothold to begin economic restructuring in coca cultivating areas. Some 226 communities signed agreements to reduce illicit coca cultivation by approximately 15,000 hectares over the next five years, in exchange for assistance to increase productivity and income from licit alternative crops.;Peruvian National Police operations seized greater amounts of cocaine base and coca leaf, but less cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) than in 1995. Efforts to arrest and prosecute major Peruvian traffickers maintained the GOP's stiff narcotics policy, and contributed to disarray among major trafficking organizations. Still, there was strong evidence that Peruvian traffickers continued to refine cocaine hydrochloride and ship it directly to Mexico for distribution in the United States. President Fujimori continued to take a tough public stance against narcotics corruption, and in 1996 created a special drug court system to handle drug offenses. The U.S. Embassy reported that incidents of military and police drug corruption were quickly addressed by the GOP.;In April 1996, the GOP passed Law 824, which established a civilian drug council (CONTRADROGAS). CONTRADROGAS was created to coordinate the efforts of the various GOP agencies involved in counternarcotics efforts, and to implement the Peruvian National Drug Strategy announced in 1994.;In 1997, the GOP must mount an aggressive effort to attract additional donor funding to expand alternative development efforts while coca farmers are still receptive to licit economic alternatives. The GOP must also ensure that the narcotics law enforcement effort which has suppressed cocaine base prices is intensified to address riverborne narcotics traffic and sustain the existing aerial intercept effort.;Taiwan;Taiwan's geographical location relative to the Golden Triangle and its importance as an advanced regional transportation and shipping center make it a major transit point for drugs destined for the U.S. and other markets. Taiwan authorities dispute this assessment, citing reduced seizures and arrests as a signal of the deterrent effect of their considerable counternarcotics efforts. The pattern of trafficking in the region, however, suggests that because of its geographic location and its ports, Taiwan will remain a target for drug traffickers. Taiwan law enforcement authorities, in fact, recently expressed concern that Hong Kong-based drug traffickers may be collaborating with Taiwan organized crime groups to transfer their base of operations to Taiwan before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty in July of 1997, and their cooperation with the U.S. on counternarcotics efforts continues to be good.;Taiwan's law enforcement cooperation with DEA (under the auspices of the American Institute in Taiwan) and other U.S. agencies expanded in 1996. Taiwan is setting up a new National Drug Intelligence Center, we envisage increased cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies resulting from this. The American Institute in Taiwan and the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative Office continue to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a framework for even broader counternarcotics cooperation. Taiwan has been conducting an aggressive anti-crime campaign on other fronts, as well, including prosecuting cases of public corruption. There are, however, no known cases of official involvement in narcotics trafficking.;In 1996, Taiwan also passed money laundering legislation meant to bring it into closer conformity with the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention. While the law enhances the ability of law enforcement officials to deal with the problem, it requires a number of revisions to enable Taiwan to meet international standards.;Thailand;Thailand remains a major transit route for drugs destined for the U.S. and other markets and produces about one per cent of Southeast Asia's opiates. It continues to serve as a model for the region as a result of its successful efforts to control opium production and its commitment to prosecuting drug producers and traffickers. Opium production in the 1995/96 growing season increased from an estimated 25 metric tons in the previous season to 30 metric tons. The upsurge in opium and heroin prices shortly after the destabilization of Khun Sa's trafficking operations in Burma was largely responsible for more widespread opium cultivation. Thailand's actions to close off sections of the Thai border with Burma, however, had helped create the conditions leading to Khun Sa's decision to reach a settlement with the SLORC.;In January of 1996, Thailand extradited a former Member of Parliament to the United States for prosecution on drug trafficking charges. Two "Operation Tiger Trap" defendants (part of drug lord Khun Sa's trafficking operation) were also extradited to the U.S. later in the year. Thirteen individuals have been arrested thus far in connection with this major "sweep.;Thai cooperation with U.S. law enforcement officials remains excellent. Thailand's Office of the Narcotics Control Board and the Police Narcotics Suppression Bureau continue to exhibit a high degree of professionalism. Corruption continues to be a problem in the Police Department, which lacks an effective internal security apparatus to hold officers accountable for wrongdoing. Elements of the Royal Thai Army and Thai Customs have also been publicly accused of corruption. The Royal Thai Government as a whole, however, supports a policy of active measures against drug production and trafficking.;Thailand is vulnerable to money laundering. A bill to enact legislation has been stalled for a number of years. In late November, the newly-elected Prime Minister promised the President that the legislation would be given special handling to hasten its passage. Passage of appropriate anti-money laundering legislation would enable Thailand to become a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Like other countries in the region, Thailand may find itself becoming an even larger market for the region's opium, heroin and amphetamine production as the region's economic expansion continues. We will be urging Thailand to enact a conspiracy law to further enhance its ability to mount effective counternarcotics efforts and to establish an amplified crop control program.;Venezuela;Venezuela continued to be a major transit country for cocaine shipped from Colombia to the United States, and for chemicals transhipped through Venezuelan ports, as well as a money laundering center. Law enforcement agencies estimate that between 100–200 metric tons (mt) of cocaine are shipped through Venezuela to the United States and Europe. The Government of Venezuela (GOV) seized only about six mt of cocaine, almost identical to the amount it seized in 1995. Heroin seizures declined by 27 percent, from 96 kilograms (kg) in 1995 to 70 kg in 1996.;A significant decision this year was President Caldera's appointment of a politically powerful drug czar and elevation of this position to a cabinet rank. However, the GOV must produce more concrete counternarcotics results to match this demonstration of political will during the next year.;Venezuela's main port, Puerto Cabello, is a favored point for illicit smuggling by narcotics trafficking syndicates. The same is true of other ports along Venezuela's long coastline. Venezuela's airspace offers further opportunities for trafficking. Traffickers transport cocaine by small aircraft primarily to Venezuela's border states of Tachira and Apure. Traffickers risk little by transporting cocaine through Venezuela due to weak and ineffectual law enforcement interdiction efforts.;The United States designated Venezuela as a recipient of more than $12 million worth of USG drawdown defense equipment. The Venezuelan Armed Forces adopted a counterdrug strategy, which defines its role as supporting the National Guard (GN) and police forces. The GOV is working with the United States to create a Joint Police/Military Counternarcotics Intelligence Center. However, much more needs to be done to improve communication and coordination between the GN and the Navy, Air Force and Army to implement the strategy.;Maritime cooperation was disrupted by GOV denials of four USG requests from United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments from third country vessels to board suspected Venezuelan narcotics trafficking vessels in international waters. However, USG and GOV authorities are currently seeking to broker a maritime agreement.;Although the GOV lacks effective controls over certain precursor chemicals, it made significant seizures of chemicals at Puerto Cabello. The GOV also continued to make significant progress against illicit cultivation. Venezuelan authorities identified replantings of about 500 hectares (ha) of coca and opium poppy fields in the Sierra de Perija region on the border with Colombia. With USG assistance, those replantings were eradicated. Since 1994, joint efforts have reduced estimated illicit plantings from 1,000 ha to 200 ha.;The GOV permitted the basing of United States military assets and personnel in Venezuela in an effort to cooperate on Operation Laser Strike, a United States Southern Command regional air interdiction operation.;Money laundering in Venezuela continued in its financial network of banks and non-bank institutions because of weak banking supervision and regulatory authority. Although Venezuela passed a drug law in 1993 that included provisions on money laundering, key provisions are lacking, including one on conspiracy.;Allegations of corruption plague the judicial branch and some elements of the GN. Law enforcement agencies believe that corruption in the GN is a problem, hobbling the effectiveness of counternarcotics efforts. These shortfalls have raised the USG's concern about trafficking through Venezuela to the United States. Venezuela must move swiftly to reform its judicial branch, whose corruption threatens to prevent Venezuela from combatting its drug problem and from protecting its democratic institutions and national territory from international drug traffickers.;Despite such problems, eradication efforts, the elevated rank of the drug czar, Venezuela's first national epidemiological survey, and other counter-narcotics efforts reflect the GOV's spirit of cooperation to advance the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention and bilateral agreements with the United States. However, the USG will scrutinize Venezuela's efforts in the coming year and will expect the GOV to be vigorously engaged in increased cooperation on drug interdiction, money laundering, chemical control, anti-corruption efforts and conclusion of a comprehensive bilateral maritime cooperation agreement.;Vietnam;Vietnam's increased trade and tourism have opened new routes for Southeast Asian heroin shipments to such consumer markets as Australia, North America and Europe. The SRV continues to battle against narcotics trafficking but has yet to overcome problems of corruption within the military and police. The SRV does, nonetheless, appear to be actively engaged on the counternarcotics issue, conducting a demand reduction media campaign as well as police operations and crop eradication programs. SRV statistics reflect cultivation of 1800 hectares of opium poppy during 1995/96. USG estimates, however, place the cultivation level at 3,150 hectares.;Vietnam created a Drug Control Master Plan in 1995 which calls for the eradication of opium cultivation by the year 2000. In October of 1996, the SRV promulgated implementing regulations for articles of the criminal code related to narcotics. The new regulations permit asset seizures in narcotics cases. Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Drug Control Cooperation Program in 1996. Vietnam has also stated that it expects to ratify the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 1997. It is currently drafting a comprehensive narcotics control law, based on the tenets of the 1988 Convention, which is expected to go before the National Assembly in 1997. The law will include statutes related to the control of chemical precursors and provide for controlled shipments as an investigative technique.;SRV interdiction efforts resulted in 6,000 narcotics-related arrests in 1996, twice as many as in 1995. SRV law enforcement agencies are working with the UNDCP to create special counternarcotics squads across the country. U.S.–SRV cooperation on narcotics issues expanded throughout 1996. Training initiatives included DEA training for Ministry of Interior narcotics control teams in Hanoi and U.S. Customs Service training for Vietnamese customs officers in Ho Chi Minh City. Several senior Vietnamese narcotics officers also traveled to the United States for consultations with U.S. counterparts. The U.S. hopes to increase the level of its assistance to Vietnam. To that end, it plans to engage the SRV in drafting a Memorandum of Understanding on counternarcotics cooperation, a successful outcome, however, will depend to a great extent on the SRV's coming to grips with the conditionality involved in any expanded U.S. assistance.;VITAL NATIONAL INTERESTS JUSTIFICATIONS;Belize;Because of a significant increase in the detected activities of Colombian drug trafficking organizations in Belize in 1995, Belize was added to the list of major drug producing and transit countries for 1996. Belizean traffickers are also working with Mexican groups to move the Colombian cocaine north to the United States. These criminal activities continued throughout 1996, but the ability of the Government of Belize (GOB) to combat them was severely undermined by deeply-entrenched corruption, which reaches into senior levels of government.;The GOB's accomplishments weighed against those areas where progress was lacking have led to a decision to consider denial of certification of Belize. The GOB's accomplishments in 1996, such as its recent accession to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and passage of money laundering legislation, were achieved only after the United States and other countries exerted intense, coordinated pressure. Belizean cocaine seizures were down 36 percent and marijuana eradication decreased by 4 percent from 1995. Finally, the record of arrests and convictions of major drug dealers was, likewise, disappointing. During 1996, the GOB took no meaningful steps to uncover or punish official corruption.;Bungled investigations, along with several high-profile trials ending in acquittal, including the prosecution of the Home Minister's son-in-law for running an illegal airstrip and two immigration officials fired from their jobs and accused of corruption in an alien smuggling case, have, at a minimum, demonstrated the GOB's deficiencies in its efforts.;The USG urged the GOB to demonstrate its willingness to cooperate with the United States in achieving reasonable counternarcotics goals and objectives. The GOB, however, is not fully cooperating or taking adequate steps to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, especially promises made by the GOB toward the end of the year to complete a new extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty. The GOB has been operating under a US–UK extradition treaty.;Denial of certification would be contrary to U.S. vital national interests because it would require the U.S. to vote against multilateral development bank funding for Belize, an important element in supporting our long-term democracy and economic development goals for the country. Such multilateral support reinforces U.S. counternarcotics assistance which is designed to help Belize develop strong, independent and credible institutions capable of bringing traffickers to justice, stemming the flow of narcotics through the country and better guarding its own borders.;Although Belize's counternarcotics efforts fell short of full cooperation during 1996, the GOB did take steps which demonstrated an effort to work with the USG. It is in the vital national interests of the United States to improve the GOB's counternarcotics efforts and ensure that they are given the attention required.;Lebanon;Lebanon appears to have succeeded in the struggle against illicit crop cultivation due to the joint Lebanese-Syrian eradication efforts since 1992. There appears to be no cultivation of opium and the cannabis cultivation (for hashish production) also has all but disappeared. There are some small farms in the Baalbek-Hermel region which are still engaged in illicit cultivation, but they appear to be few in number. When such farms are discovered, arrests are made immediately and the crops are eradicated. Lebanese Internal Security Forces (LISF) and the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), with assistance from the Syrian Army, reported eradication of approximately 70,000 square meters of cannabis in the Baalbek-Hermel region of the Bekaa Valley during June and July. There were no other reported eradication efforts during the year.;However, Lebanon remains a significant transit country for the purposes of re-export of cocaine, and many small "home"-type labs for processing opium into heroin are still reported to operate in the Bekaa Valley. Several areas of the Bekaa Valley are not under the effective control the Government of Lebanon (GOL), and these areas are vulnerable to the establishment of illegal labs.;Although local authorities deny money laundering is a serious problem, Lebanon still presents itself to narcotics traffickers as a venue for money laundering due to bank secrecy laws, which do not allow for official discovery. Corruption remains endemic through all levels of Lebanese society, reportedly including law enforcement bodies.;In March 1996, the GOL acceded to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but with formal reservations regarding certain provisions of the Convention, including those which relate to bank secrecy. The United States has already indicated its intention to formally object to these reservations if Lebanon does not withdraw them. Parliament is studying a draft anti-drug code, which would make money laundering a crime.;The GOL has displayed a willingness to cooperate with USG agencies during 1996. Unfortunately, Lebanon's reservations to some of the provisions of the 1988 UN Drug Convention suggest that the political will is not yet sufficient to comply fully with world standards.;Lebanese trafficking continues to pose a threat to U.S. citizens and interests. On the other hand, the United States considers the provision of assistance which encourages the continued development of Lebanon's economy and infrastructure as critical to peace and stability in the Middle East, which is also of vital importance to U.S. interests and stability. These factors, combined with Lebanon's sustained positive performance in eradication and other anti-narcotics efforts, outweigh the threat posed by drug trafficking through Lebanon to the United States.;Pakistan;Pakistan is an important transit country for opiates from Afghanistan, a source country for approximately 75 metric tons of opium, and a processing country for domestic opium and opium from Afghanistan. Most opium poppy cultivation and most laboratory production of morphine base and heroin in Pakistan takes place in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), which borders Afghanistan. Pakistan has a bilateral agreement with the United States that provides funding for law enforcement, roads and crop substitution in the NWFP, and demand reduction activities.;Under the government of Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's counternarcotics efforts from January through October 1996 were seriously deficient. However, the interim government of Meraj Khalid, which replaced the Bhutto government in November, took a number of significant counternarcotics actions in accordance with the U.S.-Pakistani bilateral agreement and the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;The primary counternarcotics achievement of the Bhutto government was a reduction in the cultivation of opium poppy. USG estimates of land used for opium poppy decreased 51 percent to 3,400 hectares and the estimate of production decreased 52 percent to 75 metric tons from the previous year. The Bhutto government also extradited Sialek Jan, wanted by the USG on narcotics trafficking charges in March. However, under Bhutto, Pakistani authorities failed to act on DEA information on specific cases of trafficking, severely cut the budget of the Pakistani Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), failed to act on recommendations of the UN Drug Control Programs (UNDCP) for improvements to the Narcotics Substances Act, and failed to interdict trafficking caravans in Baluchistan Province. During Bhutto's tenure, corruption was a significant problem, with ANF officials suspected of perpetrating a hoax seizure of opium base in June, and subsequently covering up their actions.;Pakistani President Leghari November 5 dismissed the Bhutto government for corruption and mismanagement, an act subsequently upheld by the Pakistani Supreme Court. Corruption is a severe and chronic problem in the Pakistani government, including the ANF, which has no bureaucratic system, such as an internal affairs section for identifying, investigating and recommending action against corrupt officers. No one in a policy-making position in either the Bhutto or interim government has been accused of narcotics-related corruption. Sufficient legislation exists to control and punish public corruption but it is seldom enforced. The interim government in November initiated a comprehensive process for holding public officials accountable for corrupt practices.;The interim government in November and December 1996 promulgated changes to the Narcotics Substances Act as suggested by UNDCP, restored some funds to the ANF, conducted two major raids on heroin laboratories in NWFP, extradited to the United States accused trafficker Nasrullah Henjrah, and arrested another individual on the U.S. extradition request list, Nasir Ali Khan.;During the course of the year, the Government of Pakistan froze $3.5 million in assets from 21 traffickers and seized 5.4 metric tons of opium and 2.0 metric tons of heroin. These figures represent declines from those of 1995.;Pakistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, which it ratified in October 1991, but implementing legislation on money laundering has not yet been drafted. The revisions to the Narcotic Substances Act approved by the interim government bring asset seizure and controlled delivery standards to the levels demanded by the Convention.;Vital U.S. national interests could be damaged if Pakistan, under the newly-elected government of Nawaz Sharif, were to be denied certification. Pakistan is a moderate Islamic state with a nuclear weapons capability. Pakistan is the largest contributor of troops for UN peacekeeping operations and has provided key cooperation in the international fight against terrorism. Denial of certification would be viewed in Pakistan as abandonment of a loyal ally and would endanger U.S.-Pakistani dialogue on vital issues. Denial of certification could also bring to a halt the counternarcotics momentum started in November by the caretaker government, and could negatively prejudice the newly elected government against counternarcotics cooperation with the United States.;Denial of certification would further endanger U.S. interests by requiring the United States to vote against Pakistan in multilateral development banks (MDBs). The United States has an interest in seeing that the MDBs continue their support of activities such as the GOP's Social Action Program and its Financial Sector Reform Project, which are essential to Pakistan's human and economic development. Pakistan is one of the largest beneficiaries of World Bank and Asian Development Bank programs.;These risks to vital U.S. interests outweigh any potential gain from denying certification to Pakistan. Pakistan is a primary conduit for opium and morphine base from Afghanistan, the second largest opium producer in the world. With continuing conflict and no central government in Afghanistan, Pakistan's cooperation is particularly important in stopping Southwest Asian drugs.;During the period of vital national interests certification, the United States will strive to work with senior officials of the new government to achieve the goals of the UN Drug Convention.;STATEMENTS OF EXPLANATION;Afghanistan;Afghanistan is second only to Burma as a producer of illicit opium, producing approximately 30 percent of the world illicit supply. Production flattened in 1996, after steep annual increases earlier in the decade. U.S. satellite surveys indicated a very small decrease in both cultivation and production, to 37,950 hectares and 1230 metric tons, respectively.;Civil war not only continued but intensified in Afghanistan during 1996. Between September and December, the Taliban, a movement started by religious students, expanded the territory it controls. The Taliban now control 90 percent of the land on which opium poppy is cultivated. The Taliban have now controlled the province producing the greatest quantity of opium for over two years. Both USG and UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) surveys indicate that there were no concerted eradication efforts in 1996.;Law enforcement actions were virtually non-existent. None of the factions controlling territory made a serious attempt to disrupt narcotics trafficking. Granted that none of the factions has an effective law enforcement bureaucracy, the ease with which narcotics caravans and refineries continued open operations was nevertheless remarkable. In the few instances the USG knows of where arrests were made, most suspects were released upon payment of a bribe.;Taliban leaders, in particular, expressed a desire to cooperate on counter-narcotics with U.S. and UNDCP officials. However, the major opium refining operations are located in Taliban-controlled territory, and the Taliban appear to have done nothing to date to discourage cultivation of opium poppy. The leaders state they cannot do so until international donors provide crop substitution and other assistance.;Many sources have reported that all major factions require farmers to pay a tax on their opium production. Some reports also indicate that deeper involvement in trafficking is also common among Afghan leaders.;The USG strongly promotes the UN Special Mission to Afghanistan's efforts to develop a broad-based national government that can address the problems of narcotics, terrorism and humanitarian concerns. We assist the peoples of Afghanistan, subject to resource availability, primarily through UN programs aimed at humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and counter-narcotics.;Inasmuch as legislation makes special allowance for continuation of such assistance generally and of assistance for Afghanistan specifically, notwithstanding any other provision of law, denying certification to Afghanistan would have minimal effect in terms of implementation of this policy.;The continued large-scale cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan, combined with the failure to initiate law enforcement actions, preclude a determination that Afghanistan has taken adequate counternarcotics steps on its own or that it has sufficiently cooperated with the USG in counter-narcotics efforts, although Afghanistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Accordingly, denial of certification is appropriate.;Burma;Burma produced 84% of the opium cultivated in Asia in 1996 and remains the world's largest producer of opium and heroin. Continuing lack of resources and commitment to effective drug control policies led to near record levels of opium cultivation, totaling 163,000 hectares with a potential yield of 2,560 metric tons of opium gum, or enough to produce 250 tons of heroin. While the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) claimed an improvement in its record with regard to drug and precursor chemical seizures, these efforts were marginal, both in terms of results and in view of the overall level of opium production and trafficking in Burma. The drug lord Khun Sa continues to be exempt from prosecution or extradition. Ethnic drug trafficking armies such as the United Wa State Army (UWSA) and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), having negotiated ceasefires with the SLORC which permit them limited autonomy, remain armed and heavily involved in the heroin trade. Their leaders have used their relationship with Rangoon to increase their wealth, but prosperity has not filtered down to the ordinary people in the areas they control. Lack of enforcement against money laundering and an underdeveloped banking system have created an economic environment increasingly conducive to the use of drug profits in legitimate commerce. While there is no evidence that the government per se encourages or is involved in the drug trade, drug money is beginning to permeate the economy.;The SLORC announced no new drug control policy initiatives in 1996. It did conduct some counternarcotics activities in areas controlled by the Kachin Defense Army, the Kokang Army, the MNDAA and the UWSA, seizing a total of 493 kilos of heroin, over three tons of ephedrine, 5,677,525 amphetamine tablets and 2668.4 gallons of acetic anhydride. These actions did not seriously threaten the drug trafficking activities of the organizations in question. The unprecedented chemical precursor and amphetamine seizures, however, have alarmed Burmese authorities because they signal a possible future stimulants problem for the Burmese.;Negotiations involving the Burmese Government, UNDCP, and Wa leaders on the "Drug Control and Development in the Wa Region of Shan State" project concluded in November. The goal is to bring about a gradual reduction of opium cultivation in the Wa area. The Burmese Cabinet has not yet formally approved the project. While the project is designed to incorporate a monitoring and evaluation component, donors have concerns about implementation.;USG engagement of the Burmese government on counternarcotics issues remains limited. DEA maintains a liaison operation with Burmese police and military units involved in drug enforcement activities. The Burmese have also invited USG participation in a third joint opium yield survey in the Shan State. The U.S. will consider further assistance only upon the Burmese Government's demonstration of a strong commitment to narcotics control, the rule of law and significant political reform.;Colombia;In 1996, as in previous years, Colombia remained the world's leading producer and distributor of cocaine and an important supplier of heroin and marijuana. In the same year, coca cultivation in the country increased by approximately 30 percent.;As in 1995, the Colombian Government made only limited progress in 1996 against the pervasive, narcotics-related corruption from which it suffers. In a process which can only be described as flawed, President Samper was exonerated of charges of corruption by the Colombian Congress. Moreover, Samper remained unwilling to confront fully the drug interests that contributed heavily to his Presidential campaign.;President Samper pledged to push for stricter sentencing laws in 1994, but there was only limited progress in 1996 to advance Congressional passage of legislation which would increase sentences for traffickers and money launderers. As an apparent consequence, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers—the notorious Cali drug leaders—received very light prison sentences which were not commensurate with their crimes. The Colombian government did not respond to the USG's request for extradition of four major drug traffickers and for most of the year it took no action in response to reliable USG information that narcotics traffickers continue to run their operations from prison. Troubling also was Samper's promotion and public praise for a drug-tainted military general—behavior which reinforces USG concern about the credibility of his stated commitment to serious narcotics control for Colombia.;On the eradication front, the Colombian Government's strong opposition to testing more than one granular herbicide—in an effort to replace less effective liquid herbicides—is especially problematic in light of the significant expansion in coca cultivation.;On the positive side, the serious work on the part of the Colombian National Police (CNP) as well as select elements of the military to confront drug trafficking must be highlighted. Government agreement to expand coca and opium eradication was taken on with determination by the CNP despite significant challenges including physical threats and lack of proper resources. In this regard, the USG was encouraged by evidence of increased cooperation from the Colombian military for the CNP in support of illegal crop eradication. The CNP and military also worked closely to counter narco- and guerrilla-sponsored public demonstrations against eradication.;There were signs that newly appointed members of the cabinet are determined and committed to advance important counternarcotics objectives. A noteworthy achievement—pushed also by private Colombian citizens—was pressure on the Congress which resulted in passage, with retroactivity, of an asset forfeiture law. However, its constitutionality is already being challenged by those who would be affected by its implementation. In November, bilateral agreement was reached to expedite shipboarding procedures and a maritime agreement was signed in February 1997. The CNP and the Prosecutor General continued their efforts against corruption by firing corrupt police and prosecutors and by continuing investigations targetted against official corruption. However, without determined and committed leadership, much-needed legal reform and a supportive political environment, real drug control successes by the CNP and other entities will be thwarted.;Progress observed in some areas holds promise for serious drug control efforts in Colombia in the future. Nevertheless, because of high-level corruption, the privileged treatment accorded to major traffickers currently in jail, light sentencing of traffickers and the government's continued stand against extradition, the USG cannot certify Columbia as fully cooperating with the United States on drug control, or as having taken adequate steps on its own to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Iran;Iran remains an important transit country for opiates from Afghanistan and Pakistan destined primarily for processing in Turkey. The USG has no recent surveys of opium poppy cultivation in Iran, but other sources believe cultivation has decreased, possibly as a result of the influx of cheap Afghan opium.;The Government of Iran (GOI) has ratified the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but the USG remains unaware of the passage of implementing legislation that would bring Iran into compliance with the requirements of the Convention. According to UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) and International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) missions that have visited the country, and reports received from countries with embassies in Iran, the GOI is attempting to meet at least some of the goals and objectives of the Convention. The USG cannot evaluate Iranian claims as we do not have diplomatic relations. There is no bilateral narcotics agreement or cooperation and Iran's performance is measured solely against the standards of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;The GOI has, according to reports by other nations, begun reaching out to Western countries in a very tentative fashion, seeking to establish a working counternarcotics relationship. There are, however, countervailing pressures and we know of no working law enforcement relationship. The GOI, Pakistan and UNDCP participate in a tripartite UNDCP law enforcement project, to which Iran contributes important resources according to UNDCP. In 1995, the latest year on which Iran reported, it claims to have seized 126 mt of opium, 2 mt of heroin and 11 mt of morphine, as well as lost 133 citizens in battles against traffickers. The USG cannot verify these claims. The level of narcotics arriving in Turkey does not appear to have diminished according to USG sources.;Credible reports have been received that corruption remains a problem. There have been accusations of corruption against individuals with access to very high levels of power. Low-level corruption remains a problem judging by the number of caravans that successfully evade massive physical barriers at Iran's eastern border. We do not know how extensively or how equitably Iran administers its anti-corruption program.;Sentences imposed for narcotics trafficking are very harsh and 1,000 people have been executed for trafficking since 1989.;Nigeria;Nigeria is the focal point of West African narcotics trafficking. Narcotics producing and trafficking organizations in Asia, South America and, increasingly, Nigeria itself either use Nigeria as a transshipment point or rely on Nigerian courier networks to transport Asian heroin and South American cocaine destined for U.S. or European markets. Nigerian trafficking organizations are among the leading carriers of Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin into the United States. In addition, Nigerian traffickers ship cannabis—the only illicit drug produced in Nigeria—to Europe and other West African countries. The Government of Nigeria (GON) has failed to address corruption adequately among law enforcement and other government agencies, hindering counternarcotics efforts.;Although the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the one positive internal agency working against drug trafficking in Nigeria, has attempted to combat trafficking and corruption, the GON has left it woefully underfunded. Lack of coordination among police, intelligence and other law enforcement agencies also prevents effective progress against narcotraffickers.;Nigerian trafficking organizations operate sophisticated money laundering operations in addition to controlling courier networks. These organizations have been quick to adapt in response to vigorous international law enforcement, as well as to efforts made by the NDLEA within Nigeria. They have found new ways to evade detection and to alter and expand their narcotics smuggling routes and markets, as GON counternarcotics efforts have effectively reduced the amount of drugs shipped through international airports within Nigeria, courier networks have increasingly relied on overland shipments to transport narcotics. Nigerian trafficking organizations actively recruit couriers of diverse nationalities, backgrounds and ages.;Perhaps the most glaring omission by the GON is its failure to provide funding for its law enforcement employees, thus making them ever more vulnerable to bribery and related forms of corruption, and to provide funding for implementation of its laws and strategies. Most law enforcement employees are paid far less than is sufficient to feed, clothe and house their families. In addition, the GON has taken no meaningful steps towards cooperation with the United States on extraditions, information sharing or prosecution of arrested fraud suspects, nor has it moved significantly towards meeting the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Syria;For several years, Syria has been an important transit country for drugs flowing into and out of Lebanon and, in many cases, on to Europe and the United States. The increase in seizures in 1996 over 1995 (especially of hashish) points to increased vigilance by Syrian authorities, but could imply as well that the total flow of drugs across Syria is increasing. Additionally, the presence of approximately 25,000 Syrian troops in the Lebanese Bekaa Valley makes Syrian cooperation with Lebanese officials a substantial element in the fight against drug production and trafficking there. Allegations of corruption against Syrian military officials stationed in Lebanon continued in 1996.;The Government of Syria (SARG) restructured its Syrian National Police force in 1996, thus creating a separate and independent Counter-Narcotics Division. The SARG continued to assist anti-narcotics efforts in Lebanon during 1996, donating more than a million fruit trees for the Lebanese crop substitution program. Though widespread reports claim that Syrian military and security personnel continue to profit from the drug trade, the SARG neither initiated corruption investigations nor brought anti-narcotics charges against any of these individuals in 1996.;Syria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Though Syria made significant progress in some anti-narcotics efforts in 1996, including more aggressive seizures of hashish and various types of amphetamines, it did not meet some of the other goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, specifically, the SARG did not move aggressively enough against narcotics transiting Syrian territory, especially to and from Lebanon, it did not take sufficient action towards locating and dismantling drug laboratories in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon, and it ignored serious allegations against Syrian officials of involvement with drug traffickers. Syria does not have a bilateral narcotics agreement with the United States.</td></tr>

To all of you, to our distinguished guests, to all Ticos and all the people of Central America, let me say, Es realmente un nuevo dia.;Less than a decade ago, much of the Americas was still dominated by civil war, repression, and hopeless poverty. Today, we celebrate the advance of peace, growing prosperity, and freedom across our hemisphere. And we honor the remarkable men and women of Central America who helped to lead the way.;When the history of our region and our time is written, it will record your courage and your strength in ending four decades of conflict, braving the threat of bombs and bullets to cast ballots, embracing the challenge of economic reform, and opening the door to a new era of partnership among all our nations.;President Figueres, in that epic struggle, Costa Rica, this nation of brothers, has been a wise leader and set a powerful example. Waging peace as tenaciously as others have waged war, Costa Rica has shown that a country does not need an army to be strong. We thank Costa Rica and its leaders for building a vibrant democracy that takes care of its citizens and shoulders its responsibilities in the world.;Three years ago, our hemisphere's 34 democracies met in Miami at the historic Summit of the Americas to secure the hard-won gains our nations have made and to make them work for all our people.

<tr><td class="c2"><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=54117&st=dominican&st1=" target="blank">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=54117&st=dominican&st1=</a></td><td class="c5">William J. Clinton: The President's News Conference With Central American Leaders in San Jose</td><td class="c6">May 8, 1997</td><td class="c7">President Figueres. Good afternoon, friends. I wish to express on behalf of the heads of state and of government of Central America and the Dominican Republic how pleased we are with the results of the extraordinary work session we have had this morning with President Clinton. It has been a very sincere dialog, a very realistic dialog, a very human dialog, and especially, a very friendly dialog.;I would like to share with you four main conclusions which are the outcome of our discussions and which are reflected in the joint declaration which we have just signed. First of all, we've inaugurated a new phase, a new stage in the relations among our countries. We attach a very special importance to this alliance. It reflects a new visional mood, a more optimistic one, a more mature one, and a more propositional one. And it also demonstrates the existence of a shared agenda, the fundamental objective of which is the well-being of our peoples through the consolidation of economies which are more and more open and integrated. And we have ratified this will.;Secondly, we wish to emphasize the brotherly spirit, the friendship and the understanding which have prevailed in our discussion of topics which we knew were sensitive and complex. We have made a special effort to reach agreements, to compromise and to understand the realities which our Governments face. Beyond those realities, we found a will to work together, and we have opened areas for this dialog to continue and for our collective action.;Third, we underlined the importance of having maintained, as a constant concern of this meeting, the social issues, the importance of which for Latin America and for our region is more vital today than ever before. We share a special concern with the more needy, a concern which reflects solidarity, not charity, as a means to generate opportunities for productive employment and to ensure the dignified life which our peoples demand.;I especially wish to recognize the contribution of women to the developing of economic democracy and how urgent it is to guarantee nondiscriminatory treatment for them in the workplaces, in political life, and in social relations generally. All this should have a significant impact in the improvement of the quality of life of the coming generations.;Finally, we wish to stress the significant role which environmental issues continue to have on our agenda. We have deepened and expanded the scope of the joint declaration of Central America and the United States, CONCAUSA, and in doing so, we have helped our region move even further forward as one of those regions which are noted throughout the world for their commitment to the rational use and intelligent use of our natural resources. In this regard, we can state that the decisions we've adopted in this field in this declaration can be characterized as revolutionary at a hemispherical level.;An essential element to attain institutional strengthening and to ensure good governance of our countries has to do with the possibility of expanding our markets and stimulating investments which generate employment and improve the quality of life. I believe that with respect to both topics, free trade and investment, we have moved forward in an impressive manner in attaining a better understanding and in acceptance that reciprocity should be the new byword in the establishment of all our discussions.;Ladies and gentlemen, the President and the Prime Minister of Belize and the Dominican Republic would like to make a special mention to the democratic circumstance that prevails in all the region: We are committed to strengthen and perfecting it.;We are aware that, at the threshold of the 21st century, it is not enough to guarantee access to free, fair, and transparent elections for our citizens. Threatened by formidable enemies such as narcotrafficking and organized crime, it is indispensable to fortify democratic institutions and to ensure ways in which civil society can participate more effectively in the decisionmaking process.;Nonetheless, it is through the development of dynamic economies and more equitable social structures that we will be able to fully grasp the benefits of democratic governance. To this regard, we are convinced that one indispensable element to ensure such democratic governance has to do with the possibility to expand our markets and, with it, stimulate investments that generate employment and improve the quality of life of our populations.;Both issues, trade and investment, were positively reinforced during our meeting with President Clinton, and we would like to emphasize our satisfaction as the new criteria that will guide our next steps towards the construction of free-trade zones in the Americas.;In closing, let me emphasize the warmth of this meeting. You, President Clinton, with your insight and your thoughtfulness, have come to Central America and with our friends from the Dominican Republic have given a new dimension to our relations. We all came here with high expectations, We had the opportunity to share our thoughts but express the feelings of our hearts. And we all part full of optimism, ready to continue our work, work that is circumscribed by the need we all have to continue bettering the conditions of living of our people.;Thank you very much.;President Clinton. President Figueres has given an excellent statement. I will just make a few brief comments. First of all, I know I speak for all of us who are guests here in thanking the President and the people of Costa Rica for their warmth and hospitality.;This is truly a new day for Central America. The transition from conflict to cooperation has changed the relationship among the Central American countries and between the United States and Central America. A decade ago, we focused on civil wars. Now, together, we are fighting against poverty and fighting for prosperity, stronger democracy, and the sustainable development of our precious resources.;It is this new reality, this new agenda that we share which brings us here to San Jose for the first summit meeting between the leaders of the United States, Central America, and the Dominican Republic in 30 years. The people of Central America have chosen peace and democracy. We must help them to prove that they made the right choice, that democracy delivers.;Today, we agreed to an intensified ongoing dialog between the United States, Central America, and the Dominican Republic to work together on issues that will make a real difference to the lives of all our people with a high level, follow-on structure to make sure that our commitments are realized.;Together we looked at ways to strengthen our democracies and to combat the drugs, crime, and corruption that threaten to undermine them. I'm encouraged by the growing cooperation among Central American law enforcement authorities, including the creation of a joint center for police studies in El Salvador. To advance it further, the United States plans to establish an international law enforcement academy in Latin America by the end of this year, modeled on our successful academy in Budapest. We also agreed to modernize extradition treaties and to apply them vigorously. Those who commit a crime in one nation in our region should know that they will have no place to run and hide elsewhere in the region.;We took important steps to broaden the benefits of open and competitive trade. Our trade with Central America exceeded $20 billion last year. That is a 120-percent increase since 1990. This dramatic increase is the direct result of the progress the nations of this region have made toward improving their economies and opening their markets.;To identify concrete actions we can take to expand commerce even more, and to explore ways to move toward our common goal of a free trade area of the Americas by 2005, we created a ministerial level trade and investment council.;The open skies agreement we signed today— the first in our hemisphere—are a powerful example of how we can move forward together. They will allow our air carriers greater freedom to increase passenger and cargo services, to lower prices for travelers and shippers, and literally to bring the Americas closer together.;Today, we also agreed that our labor ministers will meet later this year to exchange ideas on promoting respect for worker rights and improving working conditions. And we discussed the issue of immigration. I'm proud that the United States has a tradition of generous legal immigration. Last year, over 900,000 people legally immigrated to the United States. I will do what I can to preserve it because I believe America's diversity is one of our greatest strengths as we move into a new century in an increasingly global society.;But to maintain that tradition and to do what is right by people who immigrate to the United States legally, it is also necessary that we be more effective in stopping illegal immigration. Our new immigration law is designed to accomplish that objective. I appreciate the decision by several Central American nations to criminalize the terrible practice of alien smuggling, which is also a scourge to all of us.;I do want you to know that enforcing our laws, I am determined to balance the need for firm controls against illegal immigration with common sense and compassion. Our country has greatly benefitted from the talents and the energies of Central Americans who came to our shores because they were fleeing civil war. Today, the remarkable progress in that region means that many can return home. But we want that to occur in a manner which avoids destabilizing the nations and the economies of Central America, or creating enormous hardships for children and families.;There will be no mass deportations and no targeting of Central Americans under this law. I am working with Congress to implement the new law so that it does not produce these unintended results.;Finally, we explored ideas to make a good education the birthright of every child in this region. We agreed that education should be a centerpiece of next year's Summit of the Americas in Santiago, for which today's summit is an important building block.;This has been a full and a productive session. Again, let me thank my colleagues for the passion and the depth of commitment they bring to this enterprise, and to our shared vision for a new partnership between the United States and Central America on the brink of a new century. Thank you very much.;Extradition Policy and NAFTA Membership;Q. Good afternoon. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I have two questions. For you, Mr. President Figueres, I'd like to know, within the declaration, in the chapter on strengthening democracy and good governance, I'd like to know what should be understood in the paragraph that says that we take on the commitment to update our extradition treaty and apply it vigorously to make sure that criminals are taken to justice, where the effects of their crime are felt more severely.;If we are dealing here with a paragraph that is somehow suggesting for the future any possibility of extraditing our citizens—[ inaudible ]— that the Central American contingency meet in order to be considered by your country to be part of the free trade agreement and if so, if we are, after Chile, the next one—[ inaudible ].;President Clinton. I was listening—[ inaudible ]—you started talking in Spanish.;Q. Okay, so here again. My question is— [ inaudible ]—[ laughter ].;President Clinton. It's been a long day. [ Laughter ];Q. Thank you. What do you think the conditions that Central American countries should meet in order to be considered by your country to be part of the Free Trade Agreement, and if we do meet those requirements, are we the next after Chile? Thank you.;President Figueres. The biggest—[ inaudible ]—is that respecting our constitutions and the independence of the branches of government in our countries, the judiciary and the legislative. We will continue cooperating in these areas which have to do with ensuring citizen security. And in accordance with our responsibility as Presidents with respect to our population, I think we should work out together combating drug trafficking, money laundering, and these modern scourges which have been developing in our societies and which can only cause harm to our societies.;This is a reaffirmation of our will to continue working in that direction, with respect to our constitutions and to our legal provisions. We are all states under the rule of law, fortunately.;President Clinton. I would like to make one comment about that from the point of view of the United States. We do not believe that our sovereignty is undermined by extraditing people through our countries as long as they follow the same rules with us, so that we both respect each other's criminal justice system.;Now, let me answer your question. First of all, I believe that the nations of Central America have already gone a long way toward becoming part of a free-trade area by embracing democracy, open markets, and committing themselves to expanded trade, and committing themselves to increasing international cooperation. After all, we have the President of the Inter-American Development Bank here, we have the Secretary General of the OAS here. We are all working together more. We are committed already, the United States is, to working with all the nations that are here present to establish a free-trade area of the Americas by 2005, which is not so very far away.;Now, in between now and then, can we do more to have reciprocal open trade with the Central American countries? I believe we can, and I have agreed to two steps. The first is that we have set up a ministerial trade and investment council here, as a result of this communique, to identify what the next concrete steps are. But, before that, I have proposed in my budget an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and I have funded it over the next 5 years, which would permit us to reduce or eliminate tariffs on a large number of other items coming from Central America that would further deepen our trade relations.;So, I'm strongly supportive of it. I think the big steps have already been taken. The next steps are subject to agreement by our trade negotiators and people who are concerned about investment. And they can be worked out if we stay on the path we're on.;Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press];Central America-U.S. Relations;Q. Mr. President, some of the leaders here today and some other prominent Central American figures have complained in recent days that the United States pays attention to this region only in times of war and in times of natural disaster. Do you think that that has been a valid criticism?;And to President Figueres, what, if anything, has President Clinton said today that makes you think that that attitude would change?;President Clinton. Well, first of all, I think there is some validity to that criticism—that is, I think there are some sectors of our society that may have been more interested in Central America when it was a battleground in the cold war or when it could at least be interpreted to have been a battleground in the cold war. But I don't think it's a fair characterization of America as a whole or of the attitude of this administration.;After all, we convened the Summit of the Americas including all the democratically elected leaders of Central America and the Caribbean and the rest of Latin America in 1994. We have worked diligently since then in meeting with and working with various leaders in this area. We have worked for the cause of peace in Central America and applauded it when it prevailed.;And this meeting here, which as I said, is the first time since 1968 when President Johnson met with the leaders of Central America, the Dominican Republic that such a meeting has occurred, and this one has a different agenda. This is designed to send the message that we believe it is in the interest of the United States and the people of the United States, as well as the right thing to do, to have an economic and a political partnership with Central America as we move into the new century.;President Figueres. I—[ inaudible ]—to this meeting with a completely different perspective of what our relationship should be. The old relationship that we have had in the past is no longer the one that can most benefit us in the world of a globalized economy. And today, we have all come as true partners to share the responsibilities of our development and to look for common paths through which we can develop. Central America today, fully democratic and in peace, is willing to pull its own weight, and we are perfectly well aware of the responsibilities in that respect that we have as leaders of our nations. This is truly the beginning of a great new partnership.;Q. Good afternoon, Presidents. For President Clinton. The countries of Central America have been complaining—complaining that the United States has abandoned Central America lately. Aside from progressively, steadily liberalizing trade, in what other way could the United States help the people of Central America—for meetings such as this not be considered as social events with rather rhetorical results that have nothing to do with reality?;President Clinton. Well, I think there are lots of specific ways we can work with Central America apart from trade, and I mentioned one in my remarks. We intend to establish a law enforcement academy in Latin America that will serve the people of Central America in helping them to develop professional police forces that are effective and respects human rights and effective judicial systems.;We did this in Central Europe, with one in Budapest, and we have worked with a lot of former communist countries in the area of law enforcement cooperation in a way that has been extraordinarily well received there, and I believe will be here.;Last night when President Figueres and I had a chance to meet, and again today in our larger meeting, I reaffirmed our willingness to work with countries of Central America to help to expand educational opportunities and to bring the benefits of educational technology to all students. And I think there are great opportunities there. I think there are enormous opportunities for us to cooperate in the environmental areas in ways that will be helpful to the long-term stability of the nations that are represented here.;So those are just three areas in which I expect there to be significantly increased cooperation in the years ahead. In addition to that, as you know, we still have some modest aid programs. The Peace Corps is active in many of these nations, doing very constructive things. So I expect that there will be other things which will be done in the years ahead.;Keep in mind, the United States has finally voted for the first time since 1969—at least we have an agreement with the leaders of the Congress—to balance our budget. And that will permit us the freedom and the economic stability, I think, to be a better partner with our neighbors in a whole range of other areas. But the most important thing is for you to prove that your economy will work. And I think the plan we're following will enable you to do that.;Paul [Paul Basken, United Press International].;Immigration Law;Q. Mr. President, Central American leaders before this meeting were saying the new U.S. immigration laws are causing major economic and political headaches. A State Department official was quoted today as saying that, given the situation in Congress, all you have been able to offer them today was "words and promises and hot air." Did that turn out to be true, and what do you realistically expect to get from Congress on immigration between now and the date of September 30th, set out in the statement today?;And, for President Figueres, if you could, are the Central American leaders overreacting to the situation?;President Clinton. Well, first of all, let's describe what the situation is. There are a lot of immigrants living in the United States from the countries that are represented here today who came to the United States primarily because of upheaval caused in their countries during wars. Some of those immigrants are there legally, but not as legal immigrants. That is, there is a separate category of our immigration law which says if you're, in effect, fleeing political disruption in your own country, you can stay in our country but you don't become a legal immigrant with the right to apply for citizenship after 5 years. But many of them have been there quite a long while. Some of them are not legal under that status but they've been there quite a long while, and they did come because of the political upheaval.;There are two real problems with just shipping all of them up and sending them home, aside from the practical problems of whether it can be done or not. One is that a lot of them have been in the United States so long that they have families there, they have children in school, they have lives that are intertwined with their communities. And it would be significantly disruptive and unfair to the families and the children.;The other is that a lot of—such a dislocation would rob a lot of these countries of cash remittances that a lot of these folks are sending back home to their families which take the place of a lot of foreign aid or domestic economic activity in keeping the country going. And also, that level of influx would destabilize them.;So I think it's fair to say that everyone who studied this understands that the Central American countries—a number of them are in a very special category when it comes to dealing with the immigration laws.;The immigration law that we passed was designed to help us stop illegal immigration at the border, in the workplace, and in the court system. And it will achieve that. But we have to implement it in a way that is humane and recognizes the special problems created here.;So what I have said is that, number one, for the immigrants that are there legally, but not as legal immigrants—that is, they're in the category of people fleeing political problems at home—the law says that I can only exempt 4,000 people from being sent back to their countries. I will not trigger that law until September, the end of September, during which time I will work with Congress to try to figure out how to implement it.;As to people who are generally not in America legally, there will be no mass deportations and no targeting of any citizens from any country. They will have to be dealt with on a case-bycase basis.;And again, I will say, I'm not so sure, as whoever your anonymous source was, that the Congress will be unwilling to recognize the fact that these Central American countries are in a rather special category. After all, the United States Government was heavily involved with a lot of these countries during the time of all this upheaval. And just as we were quite generous—and we should have been—in welcoming Vietnamese people to our shores after the termination of our involvement in Vietnam, where our country did not prevail, in these nations where democracy has prevailed and we want to work with them to succeed, it seems to me we ought to be sensitive to the disruptions that were caused during those tough years that we were involved in as a nation. So I'm not so sure we can't get some treatments.;But the law itself, I want to say, as I said in Mexico, it's a good thing that we try to stop illegal immigration because if we don't, we won't be able to keep the American people in support of legal immigration. So we have to stop it as much as we can. But we have to understand, these Central American countries are in a different category because of what they went through in the 1980s.;President Figueres. I feel that we have advanced a lot on this subject, which is certainly important to the Central American nations for many of the reasons that President Clinton has just mentioned. But on this issue of immigration, your question was, has there been an over-reaction in Central America. I don't believe that there has been an overreaction, and I believe that we have achieved substantial progress.;If I may, on that, I would like to call perhaps on President Armando Calderon Sol, because he is really the one that, in terms of Central America, with President Arnoldo Aleman, led the conversation.;President Calderon. I would just like to add that, for us, this new relationship that we have begun between Central America and the United States, at the time of President Clinton's visit is profoundly significant. It represents a recognition by the United States, a recognition of the contribution that our people make to their economy, a recognition of the human drama that our people are experiencing in the United States because of what happens here, because this was the theater of operations of the cold war, here in Central America, to hear this from the President of the United States and to hear the profoundly humane position that he adopts when he looks at the people which have had so much pain, for us is very encouraging. And he has stated very clearly that there will not be mass deportations, that they will seek to work more flexibly with the new immigration law, that there is time from now until September for a joint initiative with the Congress and to awaken more awareness within the Congress concerning this issue which is so important for Central America.;Today is a very important day, a day of great hope for all Central Americans who, because of some of the tragic conditions of violence, had to leave to seek new shores, to find refuge in the United States.;President Figueres. One last question.;Central America-U.S. Trade;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. The question first for President Figueres, don't you think there's very little scope in having the support of the U.S. Government for a draft that would provide to expand the benefits of the Caribbean Basin Initiative when the countries of the region would like to have something more specific than that before the year 2005?;And President Clinton, don't you think that mere support of good will for a draft is actually a very small guarantee for the Central American countries when there is a Congress which is actually against anything that has to do with free trade or unions or even the Democrats, themselves?;President Figueres. With respect to trade, I feel that we have made major progress. These countries have benefitted from the Caribbean Basin Initiative for a number of years now. And this program is the basis on which we have been able to expand our exports from the entire region into traditional markets and also into new markets.;The program that the executive branch of the United States is submitting to the Congress differs from the situation of the past. It contains funds to be able to counteract the loss of tariff income, which would mean expanding the list of products and the exemptions for many of the products coming from this region.;Moreover, I think it is vitally important that we have agreed here to ask our ministers, the ministers who are involved in foreign trade, to task them with finding new ways, new creative ways to continue working together as a region with an eye to the year 2005, the date for which our continent plans to integrate. So the idea would be that we could advance even more in the field of trade before that date comes.;With respect to trade, Laura [Laura Martinez, Television 7, Costa Rica], we need to stress investment. I think this meeting, this summit meeting, in many ways, is a stamp of approval for the profound reforms that have been led by the Presidents of the area in the different countries. Today, the economies are much more open and much more competitive. They are true democracies and, of course, this opens up our doors to greater flows of investment. And ultimately, this is the way for us to integrate better.;President Clinton. I would like to try to respond to your question with two points. First of all, this is not a—from our point of view— a vague commitment. I think you should see this in three steps—the question of how we might expand our trade between the United States and Central American countries.;Number one, I have presented a budget to the Congress which, if the Congress will go along, provides for the reduction of tariffs over the next 5 years on a lot of other goods which would increase trade with both Central America and the Caribbean. It is fully paid for in my budget. And therefore, I think we will have— we have some chance of passing it, perhaps a good chance. And I certainly intend to fight hard for it. So there's that step.;Then the second step is that we have agreed to bring our trade and investment ministers together to identify what we do after that, what more can we do. Then the third step is adopting the free-trade area of the Americas by 2005.;I know 2005 sounds like a long time away, especially if you're very young, but it's not so very long. And if you think about what will then be a trading area of over a billion people, it is a stunning achievement if we can pull it off. So I am not excluding the possibility that we can do more than expand the Caribbean Basin Initiative, nor am I taking for granted that it will be done, but that is the three-step process I see.;Now, the larger point you made is that the Congress of the United States is opposed to free trade. That may not be true. There are strong opponents of expanded trade in the Congress, but there are also very strong supporters. Some people are just against trade because they think it gives the United States a bad deal. I think the evidence is squarely against them. The more we open our markets, the better our economy does. And we have wages going up for the first time in 20 years, and last year, more than half the new jobs, for the first time in many years, coming into our economy were above average wage. So trade is good for us, not bad.;Secondly, we can get a lot of people in my party—you mentioned my party specifically—we can get a lot of people in my party to vote for a fast-track authority if our trading partners will give serious attention to the question of making sure that all people in our country get to participate in the benefits of expanded trade and wealth. That's why I have advocated that we set up a labor forum to go with the business forum that will meet as we work toward a freetrade area of the Americas. The more Americans believe that all ordinary working people in other countries will benefit from expanded trade, the more likely we are to find support for it in the Congress.;Yes, ma'am.;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for you and one question for the Presidents of Central America. Regionally, Central America was looking for NAFTA parity, and then later they changed things, that they preferred to have a free trade agreement. Given the sentiments in Congress, what do you personally believe is the best venue, the most effective to get that free trade agreement? And also, when do you expect to have a fast-track authority with Congress?;And also, for the Presidents of Central America—President Figueres or any of the other Presidents that you are going to seek an amnesty with regard to immigration. I don't know if you asked for that amnesty of President Clinton, and if so, what was his response?;President Clinton. Let me answer your question quite succinctly. I think the best course is for me first to try to pass my budget which contains an expansion of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and second, to try to pass fast-track authority in the Congress this year, which I fully intend to do my best to do. We're going to work very hard on that. And at the same time, then, to consult with leaders of the Congress in both parties who favor this approach about what they believe the best way to proceed is, because we're all going to have to work together on this.;While we're consulting with Congress, there will be this meeting of our ministers, all of our ministers, identifying what they think the next step should be to continue to expand trade. So I think that our road map is quite clear, and that is the one I intend to pursue.;President Figueres. With respect to the question of immigration, it has already been covered by Armando Calderon Sol, but I would like to go back to your question with respect—that, first, Central America wanted parity an then later on began to look for other ways to acquire more investment and how do we think is the best. Don Alvaro Arzu discussed this issue extensively this morning in the forum, and I would like to invite him to answer your question.;President Arzu. Thank you. What we have stressed and tried to demonstrate is that the region of Central America is prepared, is ready. It's no longer time for us to be reaching out our hands to ask for support, although we are grateful for the support we have received. But instead, we have a desire for a more longstanding, a more permanent relationship of partnership, and more than that, we want a free trade agreement. This is our aspiration.;We need to follow certain parameters, which are requirements, with Congress for example, also with public opinion, the press—[ inaudi ble ]—in communication. But what we mostly want to tell the American union is that we are ready. In Central America, we are ready to compete. We are ready to receive investment. We are ready to generate production. And we are ready to diversify the results and the profits that we attract among the large mass of impoverished people in our region in order to begin shrinking the very profound socioeconomic gap that we still have. So we want to go beyond that, and I think we can do it.;Thank you.;President Figueres. Thank you. This concludes the press conference.</td></tr>

Clinton: Declaration of San Jose</td><td class="c6">May 8, 1997</td><td class="c7">We, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, the United States of America, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize, meeting in San Jose, Costa Rica on May 8, 1997, hereby reaffirm the remarkable democratic transformation in Central America. Central America is now a region of peace, liberty and democracy, profoundly committed to a process of integration, in which a spirit of harmony, cooperation, pluralism and respect for human rights prevails. This spirit marks an unprecedented era of stability in Central America's history.;We hold the conviction that the resources and potential of Central America and the Dominican Republic can now be focussed so as to ensure that our peoples are able to develop to their full potential within the framework of just and democratic societies. We are determined to march toward the future in a partnership based on friendship, understanding and ever stronger cooperation. This meeting marks the inauguration of a new stage in our relations, based on mutual respect and reciprocity which will give our nations greater advantages with which to successfully meet the challenges of the next millennium.;We recognize that there are great challenges that we must jointly assume and that there are many opportunities which favor the creation of a great region of shared prosperity among Central America, the Dominican Republic and the United States, as well as the creation of a visionary and creative association among our nations.;Inspired by the principles and goals of the Summit of the Americas and guided by the Central American Alliance for Sustainable Development, we recognize as the cornerstones of this renewed relationship the promotion of prosperity through the strengthening of democracy and good governance, dialogue on immigration and illegal migrant trafficking, economic integration and free trade, the continued development of just and equitable societies that provide opportunities for all people, and the development of responsible environmental policies as an integral element of sustainable development, all of which must be undertaken within a framework of mutual cooperation.;Strengthening of Democracy and Good Governance;We reaffirm our profound conviction that only democratically elected governments can guarantee the full existence of the rule of law, an indispensable prerequisite for the preservation of peace and harmony.;We reaffirm our belief in the dignity of our people and our commitment to the rule of law. We maintain that crime is one of the principal threats to the democracy, public security and social stability of our countries. For this reason, we will redouble our efforts to combat crime and improve security for our people. Consistent with our constitutional provisions and recognizing the independence of our legislative and judicial branches, we are committed to the modernization of extradition treaties and their vigorous application to help ensure that criminals are brought to justice where the effect of their crime is felt most severely.;We resolve to intensify our national efforts and to increase bilateral, multilateral and regional cooperation to combat drug consumption, drug trafficking, money laundering and illegal drug activity in all its manifestations. We reaffirm our commitment to fight corruption through mutual cooperation and the strengthening of oversight institutions and we agree to seek ratification of the Organization of American States' Interamerican Convention Against Corruption. We instruct our Ministers responsible for public security and law enforcement, and other appropriate authorities, to work together to develop a plan of action this year to combat these threats to the welfare of our people.;The Presidents of the United States and the Dominican Republic, and the Prime Minister of Belize express their support for the progress achieved by the Central American Presidents in redefining regional security within a framework of the rule of law, the enhancement of democratic institutions by strengthening civilian authority, the limiting of the role of the armed forces and public security forces to their constitutional mandates, and the fostering of a culture of peace, dialogue, understanding and tolerance based on common democratic values. The strong commitment to these principles serves as an important example to other parts of the world seeking transparency and mutual confidence in their relations.;Dialogue on Immigration and Illegal Migrant Trafficking;We are aware of the serious impact of new immigration provisions on groups that come from the region and who live and have roots in the United States. We therefore undertake to maintain an open, ongoing dialogue at the highest levels to find humane and adequate solutions to address the complexities of the immigration situation, and to ensure that each person's case is evaluated individually and fairly, taking into account his or her valuable contribution to the host country.;Having expressed their concerns to the President of the United States, the Presidents of Central America, the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize welcome the United States Government's initiation of consultations with its Congress on the scope, implementation and consequences of the recent immigration legislation approved by the United States, and are confident that the dignity and human rights of the individuals it may affect will be fully respected.;We believe trafficking in migrants is an affront to human dignity and we are committed to increase cooperation to combat this degrading practice.;Promotion of Prosperity through Economic Integration, Free Trade and Investment;At the Summit of the Americas, we decided to move toward a hemisphere united through free trade by the year 2005. We reiterate our resolve to take all necessary actions to make this "spirit of Miami" a reality. With this in mind, we call for the commencement of negotiations at the Santiago Summit of the Americas that will lead to the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). We reiterate our intention to work cooperatively throughout these negotiations.;The Presidents of Central America, the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize welcome the decision of the Government of the United States to support the expeditious passage of a bill which enhances the benefits granted under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. We recognize that unilateral concessions have been of great importance in the initial phases of the process of economic liberalization. We now believe that it is necessary to move toward a commercial relationship which offers all parties mutually beneficial conditions.;We are convinced that to promote and maintain democratic stability and to contribute to our joint prosperity it is necessary to have sound and dynamic economies. With this in mind and recognizing the advances that Central America has made in economic liberalization, we have resolved to deepen our economic and commercial relations. We will work jointly and expeditiously, consistent with the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and the FTAA process, to identify specific steps, including bilateral, multilateral and regional reciprocal trade agreements, that will intensify the economic relationships among our nations. To achieve these common trade objectives, we instruct our Ministers of Trade to constitute themselves as a Trade and Investment Council with a mandate to make specific recommendations. In support of these goals, our governments will continue efforts to conclude bilateral investment treaties and intellectual property rights agreements. In addition, under the aegis of the WTO, we will seek to liberalize our telecommunications, information technology and financial services sectors.;The signing of Open Skies Agreements between the United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua during our meeting in San Jose is a significant manifestation of this commitment and these agreements will serve to enhance our commercial relations and tourism among our people and productive sectors. In this regard, it is necessary to undertake additional actions that will strengthen and broaden technical cooperation in aviation matters.;We underscore the importance of free market economies and private sector initiatives as a source of prosperity for our people and we reaffirm our goal of promoting business events and other complementary activities that expand trade and investment relations between the private sectors of our countries.;We recognize that there are important challenges in this process that we must face to maintain suitable conditions for our economic and social growth, taking into account the particular circumstances of each country. Among these challenges are the need to maintain open markets for trade and investment, to ensure the participation of all our people in the benefits of economic growth, and to maintain a stable macroeconomy and financial system. Within the framework of a market economy, the use of debt can supplement scarce domestic savings and support high rates of investment and growth. With this in mind, we declare our intention to utilize more fully modalities that allow for better management of debt burdens and the cost of external debt.;Continued Development of Just and Equitable Societies that Provide Opportunities for All People;We express our determination to continue making necessary social investments in order to improve the quality of life in our countries. We are convinced that the training of our labor forces, combined with access to health, education and basic housing services improves the well-being of our societies, while at the same time increasing the productivity and competitiveness of our economies. We are committed to share ideas, human resources and programs within mutually agreed guidelines to promote development and democracy.;We underscore the importance of placing greater emphasis on the full participation of women in all political, social and economic spheres of development, especially in areas such as access to credit, community organization, and in the commercial sector and decision-making bodies.;We reaffirm our commitment to human rights as stipulated in the Universal Declaration and to international and interamerican human rights instruments, to which we are parties, respectively. In particular, we recognize the importance of economic, social and cultural rights, and within these we underscore the rights of workers, and reaffirm our commitment to ensure compliance with the Constitution and Conventions of the International Labor Organization, as respectively ratified by our governments. We welcome the input of the labor sector in the hemispheric economic integration process.;We recognize the efforts by interested parties such as employers and workers organizations to work together to promote respect for workers rights and enhance working conditions. We have asked our Labor Ministers to meet to exchange ideas with interested parties on this issue.;The Presidents of Central America and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize note with interest the recent announcement by the President of the United States of the Apparel Industry Partnership.;We agree that micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses are important for the social development of our countries. These entrepreneurial undertakings make it possible for a wide range of social sectors to expand productively and make a decisive contribution to the democratization of capital and the equitable distribution of wealth. We will broaden our efforts to promote such businesses and to increase their capabilities. We also request that the Interamerican Development Bank, the World Bank and other institutions and donors continue and strengthen their support of these activities.;The Development of Responsible Environmental Policies as an Integral Element of Sustainable Development;We renew our commitment to the promotion of the environmental principles and objectives of the Alliance for Sustainable Development, which inspired the signing of the Joint Central American-United States Declaration (CONCAUSA) and influenced the Conference on Sustainable Development in Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Within this framework, we recognize the goals we have reached, the support we have received and are in agreement on the need to expand cooperation to new areas of action.;We recognize the leadership of Central America in the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity, in particular, the recovery and beneficial use of ancestral knowledge from our indigenous cultures, as well as innovative use of public-private sector joint ventures. In this context, we will renew our efforts to protect endangered species and make sustainable use of flora and fauna.;We note actions already underway in Central America in the area of climate change, especially those which include the participation of our private sectors and will grant credit for Joint Implementation projects and other initiatives to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, we urge the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to make a determined effort to address these issues during the Third Conference.;In this spirit, we resolve to support the promotion of investment in environmental projects such as ecotourism, the development of renewable energy sources, recycling, the transfer of clean technologies on terms mutually agreed by all parties, and trade in organic products, among others. In particular, we highlight the importance of our joint efforts in the sustainable generation and use of energy in projects which, by combining our efforts with those of other nations, allow for taking greater advantage of our resources while at the same time fostering regional integration.;Follow-Up Mechanisms;In order to strengthen our relations as friends, neighbors and partners and to ensure an increasing and effective level of communication, coordination and follow-up among our governments, we have resolved to establish a consultative mechanism which will include periodic meetings at the highest level, an actual meeting of our Foreign Ministers, who will meet next during the October 1997 regular session of the United Nations General Assembly, a ministerial-level Trade and Investment Council, which will hold its inaugural session in Washington, D.C., and an ongoing dialogue on immigration issues at the highest level.;In addition, our Ministers responsible for public security and law enforcement and our Ministers of Labor will convene meetings in their respective areas this year.;JOSE MARIA FIGUERES OLSEN, President;Republic of Costa Rica;ARMANDO CALDERÓN SOL, President;Republic of El Salvador;WILLIAM J.

Clinton: Caribbean/United States Summit: Bridgetown Declaration of Principles</td><td class="c6">May 10, 1997</td><td class="c7">We, the Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean nations of Antigua and Barbuda, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the Commonwealth of Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, the Republic of Haiti, Jamaica, the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the Republic of Suriname and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and of the United States of America, meeting in Bridgetown, Barbados on May 10, 1997, pledge to strengthen our cooperation in responding to the challenges of the coming millennium, in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect.;2. We affirm our unswerving commitment to the norms of international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Charter of the Organization of American States and our respect for the sovereignty of states, multilateral approaches, democratic traditions, human rights, good governance, human dignity and the rule of law.;3. We recognise the heterogeneity and diversity yet shared identity of our family of nations and people bonded by historic and ethnic origins, cultural ties and affinity and close social and economic links. We remain appreciative of the significant contribution of our respective nationals as immigrant communities to the development of each other's societies.;4. We also recognise the inextricable link between trade, economic development, security and prosperity in our societies. We therefore declare our intention to act in concert to improve the economic well-being and security of all our citizens, to defend and strengthen our democratic institutions and to provide for social justice and stability.;5. As we enter a new century marked by rapid expansion and globalisation of finance and investment, production and commerce, driven by revolutionary developments in technology, we acknowledge the need for a new era in our partnership. In this context, we re-affirm our support for the Declaration of Principles and Plan of Action adopted by the 1994 Summit of the Americas of Miami. We recall that this process undertook to consider the special needs of small economies, with a view to enhancing their level of development and preparing them to meet the challenges posed by the inexorable trends of globalisation and liberalisation of the world economy, and the creation of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. We note the increasing role of the human, technological and communication capacities required for operating in this new competitive international environment and the current reality in most Caribbean States and accept the need for systematic, cooperative initiatives to strengthen the quality of their human resources and technological capacity.;6. Firm in our conviction that stable and prosperous economies, buttressed by the rule of law, are bulwarks against the forces of transnational crime, we are concerned by the growing strength and capabilities of transnational criminal organisations and drug cartels, their attempts to distort and weaken our free economies and democratic systems, and the effects which their activities and presence have on levels of violence and basic public order. We declare our resolve to collaborate in combatting both organised transnational crime and the threat posed to our peoples and the foundations of our nations by illegal firearms and ammunition trafficking. We are acutely concerned by the increasing incidence of alien smuggling and commit ourselves to search for creative and innovative ways to improve our justice systems and the cooperation between them, in order to provide our societies with that sense of security and stability so necessary to freely pursue sustainable social and economic development.;7. We recognise that despite the substantial progress in dealing with debt problems, high foreign debt burdens still hinder the development of some of our countries. We therefore affirm the importance of appropriate debt management measures including those in the programmes of the International Financial Institutions.;8. We affirm our strong commitment to internationally recognised labour standards and worker rights, especially freedom of association and collective bargaining. We underscore the importance of the empowerment of women to permit their full participation in the political and economic spheres, through fair access to education, health care and credit and recognise that addressing and preventing violence against women is an important step toward our goal of strengthening democracy. Vibrant, sustainable and equitable development requires the contribution of all members of society.;9. To achieve these objectives and maintain our process of consultation, we agree that all Ministers/Secretaries of State of the nations of the Caribbean responsible for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State of the United States of America will meet to oversee and report to us on an annual basis on the implementation of the Plan of Action appended hereto. In addition, we hereby establish Joint Committees on Justice and Security and on Trade, Development, Finance and Environmental Issues, the latter to work in close collaboration with the CARICOM/U.S. Trade and Investment Council, to facilitate an increasing and effective level of communication, coordination and follow-up among our Governments.;10. Towards these ends, we adopt and issue this Bridgetown Declaration of Principles, detailing our beliefs and uniting our efforts to strengthen the ability of our States to pursue sustainable development and to preserve our democracy, peace, economic and social progress and to which we hereby affix our signatures.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Narcotics Producing and Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">November 9, 1997</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr. Chairman: (Dear Ranking Member:);In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA), as amended, I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug-producing or drug-transit countries: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Jamaica, Laos, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. These countries have been selected on the basis of information from the March 1, 1997, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and from other U.S. Government sources.;This year, I have removed Lebanon and Syria from the list. Both countries were placed on the majors list ten years ago on the basis of important, illicit opium cultivation in Lebanon's Beka'a Valley, a region under the control of Syrian occupation forces. Evidence that Syrian troops at the time were protecting and facilitating drug cultivation, production, and transportation led to the inclusion of Syria on the list beginning in 1992, however, Lebanon and Syria jointly began a campaign to eradicate the more than 3,400 hectares of Beka'a Valley opium poppy cultivation.;This effort has been effective, since U.S. Government surveys have detected no current opium poppy cultivation. Though both countries are transit areas for South American cocaine, and small laboratories in Lebanon reportedly refine Southwest Asian opium into heroin destined for Europe and the West, there is no evidence that any of these drugs reach the United States in quantities that significantly affect the United States. I have removed both countries from the majors list this year and have placed them on the watch list, with the understanding that they will be once again listed as major illicit drug producers or transit countries, should the evidence warrant.;Netherlands Antilles. Analysis of the trafficking patterns in the region indicates that there is continuing drug activity taking place around the Netherlands Antilles, especially in the vicinity of St. Maarten. Although at present there is only anecdotal information, it is possible that significant quantities of U.S.-bound drugs are involved. If I determine that drugs entering the United States from the Netherlands Antilles do so in sufficient quantities as to affect the United States significantly, I will add the Netherlands Antilles to the list of major illicit drug-transit countries.;Turkey and other Balkan Route Countries. Although I remain concerned over the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin moving through Turkey and neighboring countries to Western Europe along the Balkan Route, there is no clear evidence that this heroin significantly affects the United States—as required for a country to be designated a major transit country. In the event that I determine that heroin transiting Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, I will add the relevant countries to the majors list.;Cuba. Cuba's geographical position astride one of the principal Caribbean trafficking routes to the United States makes it a logical candidate for consideration for the majors list. While there continue to be some credible reports that trafficking syndicates use Cuban territory (including waters and airspace) for moving drugs, it has yet to be confirmed that this traffic carries significant quantities of cocaine or heroin to the United States.;Central Asia. There have been recent probes of potential cultivation sites in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These probes did not show significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, I will add the relevant countries to the majors list.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, they do not appear on this list since I have determined, pursuant to FAA section 481(e)(2), that in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States, and thus such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute Dinner</td><td class="c6">September 23, 1998</td><td class="c7">Audience members. Viva Clinton!;The President. Thank you.;Audience member. Twelve more years! [ Laughter ];The President. That's for the guy that just left. [ Laughter ] Thank you.;Congressman Becerra, thank you so much for your remarks and for your truly outstanding leadership of the Hispanic Caucus. Thank you, Carmen Delgado Votaw, for your welcome. I thank all the Members of Congress and our administration and staff who are here for their service to our country. I thank you for that warm welcome, for being my friends, for standing with me on sunny days and in strong winds. But most of all, I thank you for being willing to fight for the America we want for our children in a new century.;Hurricane Georges;Before we begin, as the Vice President indicated, I would like to say just a word about Hurricane Georges. In Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in Haiti, in the Dominican Republic, businesses and homes have been swept away and lives have been lost. Tonight our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this terrible storm. Our FEMA Director, James Lee Witt, has told me that we are already assisting in the cleanup effort, and we are providing humanitarian aid in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. We are also helping the people of Florida to prepare for the hurricane, and Secretary Cuomo is leading a delegation to Puerto Rico. I thank him for that. We will be there every step of the way to help these communities and these people to rebuild.;Congressional Hispanic Caucus;I also want to join the Vice President in paying tribute to Henry B. Gonzalez and Esteban Torres. They are both friends of mine.;I first met Henry Gonzalez in 1972. I never will forget an evening I spent with him in the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, the weekend before the Presidential election, and about the only thing we had to enjoy was the mango ice cream they had served there for over 100 years. [ Laughter ] On the night before my election as President in 1992, we had a late-night rally in San Antonio, and thinking of that night so long ago—20 years ago then—I got $400 worth of mango ice cream for our campaign plane so that we could eat it with two reasons to be happy. And let me say that Henry B. Gonzalez has been a pioneer and a conscience for the Congress and the country. He has the heart of a lion, and we'll always be grateful to him.;From his days as a UAW shop steward to his days as chair of this caucus, Esteban Torres has fought tirelessly to make certain that economic growth benefits all working people and not only the people of this country but of Mexico as well. He has been a lion in the fight for a decent and better America. I will miss him, very, very much. And I thank you, sir, for your service.;If I could just continue the appreciation for a minute, I want to thank the members of this caucus and their supporters for what has been done for America and what we have done together. Together we expanded the earned-income tax credit and cut taxes for 15 million hard-working families, including more than one million Hispanic families. And when the majority in Congress tried to slash it, together we said no.;Together we increased the minimum wage for 10 million Americans, including nearly 2 million Hispanics. And we are trying to increase it again for 12 million Americans. I'm very disappointed that yesterday over 95 percent of the Senate Republicans voted against it, but I haven't stopped fighting, and I don't think you have either. It is time to raise the minimum wage for people who need and deserve it.;Together we fought for and won the biggest increase in children's health care in more than 3 decades to insure up to 5 million uninsured children, almost all of them in low-income working families in America. We expanded the Head Start program and passed the family and medical leave law, to give millions of people a chance to take time off from work when a baby is born or a parent is sick.;Together we have opened the doors of higher education with the HOPE scholarship, more Pell grants, tax credits for all higher education, deductible student loans. Because of your efforts, everyone who is willing to work hard can now go to college without being afraid of being crushed by the burden of debt, and I thank you for that.;Together, under the leadership of the Vice President, we created more than 100 empowerment zones and enterprise communities, community development banks, we doubled small business loans to minorities, tripled them to women. Administrator Aida Alvarez is here, and she would want me to say that businesses owned and operated by Hispanic women are the fastest growing category of small business in America today.;Together we shaped and passed an historic crime bill to take guns off our streets, put police back on our streets, and provide more prevention to keep our children out of trouble in the first place.;Together we have built an America that has the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years, the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in a generation, the fastest real wage growth in 20 years, a record number of new small businesses every year, the lowest crime rate in 25 years, the highest homeownership in the history of our country—and you did it. None of this could have been done without the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.;I thank the Vice President for mentioning those who serve and who have served in the Cabinet, in high administration positions, and in the White House. I thank you for all you have done as well.;Now, having said that, the real question before us this evening is, what shall we do with this moment of prosperity? What shall we do with this moment of opportunity? You know, a lot of people, when times get really good, tend to do one of two things, and I would argue both of them are wrong: one, just say, "Well, I've worked really hard. Times have been tough. I think I'll just relax for a few years", or, two is to say, "Well, things are so good, nobody can mess it up. So I think I will just indulge myself in some diversion." As a country, we cannot do that.;I tell you tonight, my friends, that the challenge before us is, what do we do with this prosperity, what do we do with this confidence, what do we do with these good times? I feel very strongly that we need to say loud and clear that we believe that the time has come to thank God for our blessings and then to say we intend to use these blessings to meet the big challenges facing America that will shape the future of our children, and to go back and pick up those folks who have not participated in the benefits of the last 6 years and give them a chance to do it as well.;There was an old Mexican proverb that says, "El que no siembra, no levanta", "he who does not sow, doesn't get a crop." It is time to sow the seeds of the future, to build the America we want for our children. We cannot afford to rest, we have work to do.;And what is that work? First, we cannot rest until we save Social Security for the 21st century. Now, what do I mean by that? Every person in this audience thrills whenever anyone refers to mi familia. Our family, our national family, is getting older, I ought to know. I am. I'm the oldest 52-year-old man in America. [ Laughter ] I am the oldest of the baby boomers, all of you who are my age. When all of us are retired, there will only be about two people working in America for every one person drawing Social Security.;Now, we have three choices. We can do something now, modest but disciplined, to preserve this system into the future, with all of its benefits. Or we can do nothing until the crisis occurs, and we'll have two choices. Those of us who are older can expect our children to hike their taxes a lot and lower the standard of living of their children. Or we can just do without a lot of the benefits that have lifted half the seniors in America out of poverty today. I don't think either one of those is a very good choice.;In just a few days we will have the first balanced budget and surplus in 29 years. Now, I believe if we really care about our national family, we ought to stand up and say, "Look, we know it's just a few weeks before the election. We know there are those on the other side who say that we ought to have a tax cut right now based on projected surpluses into the future. And we know that's widely popular at election time. But we didn't get the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years and the first balanced budget and surplus in 29 years by doing what was popular today. We did it by doing what was right for the long run. And we'd like to at least see the ink turn from red to black, then dry a little bit, and save Social Security before we squander this surplus." That is what I believe we should do.;Second, we can't rest until all our kids in all our communities have a world-class education. Our budget, our balanced budget, provides for hiring 100,000 more teachers to lower average class size to 18 in the early grades. All the research shows that does more to help children learn and have permanent learning gains than anything else we can do.;It provides funds to build or repair 5,000 schools with kids—the largest they've ever been in our classroom—the largest number of students. It provides funds to hook up all of our classrooms to the Internet, not just those of the wealthiest school districts.;It provides funds to reward school districts who undertake sweeping reforms like Chicago has. In Chicago today, the summer school— the summer school—is the sixth biggest school district in America. Over 40,000 children every day during the school year get three square meals at school. Yes, have high standards, yes, end social promotion, but for goodness sakes, do something for those kids that deserve a better shot and need more help to succeed in life.;And our budget provides funds to hire 35,000 teachers to go into troubled inner-city and other isolated neighborhoods by saying to the brightest young people, we'll pay your way to college if you'll teach off the cost by going into those tough neighborhoods and giving those kids a world-class education.;No community in America has a bigger stake in this than the Hispanic community. That's why I established an advisory commission on educational excellence for Hispanics, and why I have proposed a special $600 million Hispanic education action plan to transform schools with high dropout rates, to support Hispanic colleges, to help adults who want to learn English or get a high school diploma, to help all Latinos, young and old, to reach their dreams.;And you and I know, yes, our children must master English. That's why I fought for a 35 percent increase in bilingual education, to help 1,000 school districts improve teacher training and add extra classes for students who haven't yet mastered English. You know, when people go around and tell me all about the failures of bilingual education, I say, "Well, look at the number of school districts who have so many more children whose first language is not English that don't have any teachers who have been certified to teach them English." Let's solve the problem instead of making it a political issue. The Hispanic action education plan would help to train 20,000 teachers to help children with limited English.;This is not just a Hispanic problem anymore. Just across the river here in Fairfax County, there are children from 150 different national and ethnic groups. Being able to speak more than one language is a gift that more of us need. But in America, unless one of those languages is English, our children can never reach their full potential. This is not the subject of a divisive political battle. Let's look at the facts, put our children before our politics, and do what's right for the country, and actually give people the chance to speak this language.;Let me also say we can't rest, with 160 million Americans in managed care plans, until we pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights that says doctors ought to make medical decisions, not accountants.;Think of this. Don't you believe whatever your health plan is that you ought to have the right to see a specialist if you need it? If you walk out of this banquet tonight and—God forbid—you get hit by a car, don't you think they ought to take you to the closest emergency room, not one halfway across town that happens to be covered by your plan?;Those of you who are older, remember what it was like when a child was first born into your family? How would you feel if, because the mother or the father is in a plan covered by a small business, if the small business changes health plans and you're 6 months pregnant, or your wife is 6 months pregnant? I think you ought to be able to keep the same doctor until the baby is born. But that's not what plans provide today. I think that ought to be a right.;If you've ever had anybody in your family in chemotherapy treatment, it's pretty tough. I've been there, a lot of you have. You try to make jokes about whether your hair is going to fall out. You try to deal with people when they get sick to their stomach and they can't eat. Nobody ought to have to worry, in addition to that, about whether in the middle of the chemotherapy treatment somebody is going to send you a letter in the mail and say, "I'm sorry, you've got to change doctors. You've got to do it all over again. You've got to start all over again." That is wrong. That is wrong, and we ought to stop it. That's—we ought not to rest until we do.;We ought not to rest while any of our communities are still segregated by income or race. The Government should lead the way in word and deed. I've asked Secretary Cuomo to crack down on unfair housing practices, to double the number of housing discrimination cases, to work with you to undertake a major legislative overhaul so public housing will help to deconcentrate poverty, mix incomes, and thereby mix people of all races and ethnicities. We can't live together as one nation unless we're able to live together in our own communities. And I ask you to help me work together on this.;We can't rest until every neighborhood can reap the benefits of our economic growth. That's why we should fund the empowerment initiatives the Vice President and Secretary Cuomo have worked so hard for, to get more investment, more jobs, and more opportunity into the neighborhoods which still have unemployment rates that are too high and incomes that are too low. We can do it now. If we can't do it now, with unemployment rates so low, when will we ever be able to do it? We should not walk away from this session of Congress without that empowerment agenda.;We should be proud that we have the lowest welfare rolls in 29 years, that we made good on our promise to restore some benefits to legal immigrants. But there is much more to be done. The pressures to move from welfare to work are intense, and the transition can be especially difficult for Hispanic women who lack language or job skills. I want to make sure every individual has the tools to succeed in this transition. That's why we fought for a welfare-to-work fund in the balanced budget, to help people make it, for $50 million more for transportation for people who don't have cars. And that's why I have proposed in my balanced budget a $21 billion child care initiative to add to what we fought for in the welfare bill. Nobody should have to give up being a good parent to succeed in the workplace.;And we cannot rest until we do have an accurate census count. I just want to make sure everybody in this room understands the importance of that. Some in Congress would have us ignore the best scientific methods for ensuring the most accurate count—that is, methods that Republican as well as Democratic experts say is the best way to make sure everybody gets counted. I don't know why some people are afraid of having all Americans counted— counted in the drawing of congressional districts, counted in the delivery of Federal aid funds. In 1990, 5 percent of our Hispanic citizens were not counted. Nearly 70—listen to this—nearly 70,000 Hispanic children in Los Angeles County alone were left out. Now, we can do better than that. This is a fundamental issue. This is a civil rights issue. If you believe every American counts, don't you also believe we have to count every American?;And while we're at it, once again I call upon the Congress to give the 4 million people of Puerto Rico the right to choose their own status. It is important. Now, in December the Puerto Rican people go to the polls. The Republican leaders of the Senate say, and I quote, they will "consider" the results of the referendum. I say, I will respect the results of the referendum.;Now, we cannot rest until we keep economic growth going throughout the world, until we contain all this trouble our friends in Russia and Asia are experiencing, until we do everything we can to keep it from spreading to Latin America, which has been threatened by global financial events that they had nothing to do with creating. This is in our interests. The Latin markets are our fastest growing ones. They are the people that are doing more every year to buy American products as we build closer ties.;I have spent a lot of time on Latin America. Hillary has gone to Latin America several times and is about to go again. We always believed that in the future of America, not only would Hispanic-Americans become our largest minority but Latin America would become our closest partners for democracy as well as for prosperity.;Now, when you see all this debate in the paper about the IMF, that's really what that's about. The International Monetary Fund is a way that we work with other people to help countries that are doing the right thing get back on their feet and to try to stem and limit this economic turmoil. I ask your help in that. We need to do it for the benefit of our own people, as well as for our obligation.;Finally, let me say we cannot rest until we continue to work to bring America together across racial and ethnic lines. Last week, for the final time, I met with my Advisory Board on Race and received their report. Again, I say to you this is not a black/white issue, this is not even a black/white/brown issue. America is becoming ever more diverse, and it is our great, great asset as we move toward a new century in what is not only a global economy but increasingly a global society, where we face the same opportunities and the same dangers. We have got to learn to stop using our racial and ethnic differences as wedge issues in political campaigns and start lifting them up as money in the bank for 21st century America.;I see General McCaffrey out there, our drug czar. You know, we had a meeting the other day with the new Colombian President, a man who has actually had his own life imperiled for standing up against narcotrafficking. No children anywhere have an interest in anything other than doing everything we can to keep them away from the dangers of drugs. No children, without regard to race or income, have an interest in anything other than an America which educates all our children. No people anywhere in this country have an interest in anything other than an America which guarantees quality health care to all of our kids and gives every working family the dignity of knowing that if they work hard and obey the law, at least they should not live in poverty. That is the kind of America we have to build.;And let me say that immigration has been and will be an important part of that process. It is not only good for America, it is America. And I say to you, we must continue to welcome new immigrants, to encourage them to become a full part of American society, and to help them become citizens and voting citizens, not stand in their way when they seek to do it.;So I say to you, you have been very kind to me tonight. You were enthusiastic. You cheered. You were happy. I had a temptation to throw this speech away and give you an old whoop-de-do—[ laughter ]—even though I'm not running anymore for anything. But I decided it was the wrong thing to do because you need to know what is really at stake, what is really going on, what really should bring you here.;In a few weeks, all of you and all our fellow citizens will be given a chance to go to the polls in November and choose what to do with this moment. Will it be partisanship or progress? Will it be about people or politics? Will we squander the moment or seize it? That is the decision before us. And as happy as I am and grateful for the reception you gave me, that's not what this is about. It's about you and your children and all the people out there all over this country. That's what this is about.;Thirty years ago, Robert Kennedy traveled to California to see a prostrate Cesar Chavez, who was fasting in penance, bedridden, for the violence caused by the struggle for farm workers' rights. That night they broke bread together in a Thanksgiving mass, and someone read the words Chavez was too weak to speak, words I would like to share with you tonight as I leave. Here is what he said: "Our lives are all that really belong to us, so it is how we use our lives that determines what kind of people we are." He said later that that night was the night Robert Kennedy made up his mind to run for President and, ultimately, to give his life for many of the causes for which we struggle today.;My friends, you and I are bound by a commitment to fulfill the legacy of this country's history, to deepen the meaning of our freedom, to widen the circle of opportunity, to strengthen the bonds of our community, and to stand against all those and all the forces that would divide us, demean us, or hold us back. Most everybody here has a magnificent American story. Most everybody here can look back on parents and grandparents and great-grandparents of whom you are immensely proud but who overcame unimaginable odds and braved great sacrifices so that one day their children or their children's children could put on the clothes we wear tonight and come to a banquet like this tonight and be grateful to them for what they did for us.;Once in a generation, a country is in the position we find ourselves in tonight. With this kind of success, this kind of prosperity, this kind of confidence, this kind of opportunity to lead in the world, we cannot rest, we cannot indulge ourselves. We have work to do. We have work to do so that when our children and our children's children reach their maturity, they will know that we did what was right in this time, and we listened to the words of Cesar Chavez.;God bless you, and thank you so much.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks on the Census Bureau Report on Income and Poverty and an Exchange With Reporters</td><td class="c6">September 24, 1998</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you very much. She was terrific, wasn't she? Let's give her another hand. I thought she was great. [ Applause ];Congressman Cardin, welcome. I know you're proud of your constituent here. Jessica, welcome. We're glad to see you. I think Congressman Blagojevich is here. We welcome him, along with Senator Efrain Gonzalez, who is the president of National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, and Councilman Robert Cantana of Buffalo. Let me once again thank Monique for her remarkable statement and her even more remarkable life.;I'm delighted to be joined here by our economic team—by Erskine Bowles and Secretary Rubin, Secretary Herman, Gene Sperling, Jack Lew, Janet Yellen, Larry Summers. Their tireless, often literally sleepless work has been very instrumental in sparking and maintaining what soon will be the longest peacetime boom in American history.;Officials of the Census Bureau who are here today, I want to thank all of you. We're going to be talking a little bit about some Census Bureau statistics. Sometimes we take your hard work and statistics for granted. The fact is that you ensure that our democracy is truly representative. And let me say in that connection once again, Congress must not hamstring the Census Bureau's efforts to maintain the most up-to-date, accurate scientific methods to produce the year 2000 census. They deserve the chance to succeed. Monique Miskimon has shown us today once again that every American counts. That means every American deserves to be counted.;Hurricane Georges;Now, before I get into the details of the very positive economic report which Monique and her daughter so vividly represent, I think we all want to say just a few words and reflect on the powerful impact of Hurricane Georges. In the Caribbean islands, businesses and homes have been swept away, tragically, many lives have been lost. Meanwhile, the projected track of the storm places the hurricane center over or near the Florida Keys late tonight or early tomorrow morning. As we speak, we're helping the people of Florida prepare for the hurricane. We've already sent assistance to Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Obviously, we're working with the officials in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.;James Lee Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has informed me that FEMA's Region VI emergency response team arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, at 10 o'clock this morning. Here in Washington, the FEMA emergency support team is operating at level one, its highest level, on a 24-hour basis.;Our support teams and our prayers are with those in the Caribbean as they begin to rebuild and those in the Florida Keys as they brace for the impact of the storm.;Income and Poverty Report;Now, as President, from my first day here, I have done my best to fulfill a commitment I made to the American people: first of all, to restore the reality of the American dream, of opportunity for all responsible citizens, of a community in which we all count and work together, and secondly, to reclaim the future for our children, to strengthen our country for the century ahead.;To accomplish that mission, we began first with an economic strategy to shrink the deficit and balance the budget, to invest in the education and skills of our people, and to expand the export of American goods. The census report released this morning represents one more year's worth of compelling evidence that this economic strategy is working and that there are lots more people out there like Monique Miskimon.;The report shows that last year the income of the typical American household grew at nearly twice the rate of inflation. Since we launched our economic plan in 1993, the typical family's real income has risen by more than $3,500. That's an extra $3,500 that hardworking families can put toward their children's education or a downpayment on a first home. Income for typical African-American and Hispanic families increased by more than $1,000 last year alone.;This report also shows that our growing economy is giving more and more families a chance to work their way out of poverty. The poverty rate fell to 13.3 percent, and while we still have plenty of room for improvement, the African-American poverty rate fell to another record low. Hispanic poverty saw the largest one-year drop in two decades. Child poverty has dropped in the past 4 years, more than in any 4-year period in the last three decades. And the earned- income tax credit, which Monique spoke of a moment ago, has raised more than 4 million people out of poverty in the last year alone.;The report this morning shows that economic growth continues to raise incomes, lift millions out of poverty, and extend opportunity. It also shows that we have more to do. Since 1993, every income group has benefited from our Nation's economic growth, and the lowest 20 percent of our people in terms of income have had the highest percentage increases. That's the good news, after over 20 years of increasing inequality.;But that inequality is still too high, and it simply means there are too many American families out there working hard, doing everything we could possibly ask of them, and still having a hard time getting ahead. We have to use our prosperity and the confidence that it inspires to help our hardest pressed families and our hardest pressed communities to ensure economic growth for all Americans.;The most important thing we have to do, of course, is to maintain the economic strategy that got us here in the first place, above all, the strict fiscal discipline that has given us low interest rates, low inflation, big investments, and more jobs.;Exactly a week from today, we will have the first balanced budget and surplus since Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon in 1969. Unfortunately, this week in the House of Representatives, the Republicans are moving forward with a proposal that drains the new surplus to pay for their tax plan. We can cut taxes. Indeed, my balanced budget includes targeted tax cuts for child care, for education, for environmental cleanup. But tax cuts must be paid for in full if we are to expand opportunity in the years to come.;I say again, we have been waiting for 29 years to see the red ink turn to black. We have a huge baby boom challenge coming when all the baby boomers retire. Social Security, as presently constituted, cannot sustain that retirement. We have to reform Social Security if we want to have it for our parents—that's me, when the baby boomers retire—without undermining the standard of living of our children and grandchildren.;So I say again, let us not get into this surplus we have worked for 29 years for—or we've waited for 29 years for and worked for 6 years for. Let's don't get into that and spend it in an election year tax cut until we have saved Social Security for the 21st century, for the sake of our children and our grandchildren.;Second, we have to continue to invest in our people and lift them all up. I was deeply disappointed this week when 95 percent of the Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the minimum wage. To reject an increase in the minimum wage when there are still so many people working full-time and raising children in poverty, when the unemployment rate and the inflation rate is so low, I believe is a mistake and sends the wrong signal to the American people.;I thank the 95 percent of the Democratic caucus in the Senate who voted for the increase in the minimum wage. Working Americans deserve it. I'm disappointed, with only a week left in the fiscal year, we rejected this, and I haven't quit fighting for it. I think eventually we will get it in the next several months. If we have to wait until next year, we will get it.;But I'm also disappointed—as I said, a week from today we end the fiscal year, and we start a new one. And there's still been no action in the Congress on our vital education investments. Indeed, what action there has been in the House of Representatives has been negative, has been a setback for education.;Congress should work with us to enact my plan, paid for in the balanced budget, to reduce class size to an average of 18 in the early grades, to hire 100,000 teachers to teach those children in smaller classes, to rebuild or to construct or repair 5,000 schools so our kids will have good, adequate, safe schools to attend, to hook up all of our classrooms—all of them, even in the poorest neighborhoods—to the Internet by the year 2000, to improve early literacy by funding the program to send volunteers in to make sure that every 8-year-old can read, to lift our children's sights with voluntary national standards and clear means of measuring them.;Now, if we hope to maintain our economic growth well into the next generation, we have to give every American child a world-class elementary and secondary education. So I say again: We've been here for months and months, there's just a week left in the budget year, let's finally have action to improve our public schools and give all of our kids a world-class education.;The third thing I'd like to say is we have to continue to lead in the global economy if we want the American economy to continue to grow. We're enjoying unsurpassed economic prosperity, but all of you read the papers every day. You see the news at night. You know there are troubles elsewhere in the world. You know our friends in Asia and Russia are facing great turmoil. You know we're trying to keep our big trading partners and friends in Latin America from having the negative effect of that turmoil reach them, even though they are pursuing good policies. That's why it's important for Congress to fund our America's share of the International Monetary Fund, because the International Monetary Fund helps the countries that are helping themselves to return to growth and serves as an insurance policy against having the financial crisis spread to the countries that are doing the right thing and keeping Americans at work by buying our products.;Again I say, there is no reason not to do this. We've only got a week left in the budget year. We've been talking about it all year long. The problem has only gotten worse. It is time now to say, we're doing this because it's what America owes as the world leader, and more importantly, we're doing it because it is absolutely necessary to keep American economic growth going.;Finally, let me say that with just a week left in this budget year, I'd still like to see the Congress pass a decent Patients' Bill of Rights, one that covers—[ applause ]. Our bill would provide protections to all Americans, simple ones: If you get in an accident, you can go to the nearest emergency room, not be hauled to one halfway across town. If your doctor tells you you need to see a specialist, you can see one. If it comes down to a dispute about whether a medical procedure should or should not be applied, the decision should be made by a doctor, not an accountant. Your medical records ought to be protected in privacy. If your employer changes health care providers, it shouldn't affect you if you happen to be in the middle of a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment or some other thing that would be entirely disruptive and dangerous and damaging to your health care if you had to change doctors in the middle of the procedure.;Now, we do that for everyone. The House passed a bill on a partisan vote, completely party-line vote, that doesn't protect 100 million people and doesn't provide any of those protections to the people that are covered. The Senate majority leader actually shut down business in the Senate a few days ago to keep them from voting for it, so they wouldn't be recorded— they wouldn't be recorded as killing the Patients' Bill of Rights—but they could kill it and still satisfy the insurance companies that are doing their best to do it.;There's still time. We haven't broken for the election yet. We can still do the right thing by the American people. But we have to think about it. We have to focus on it, and we have to put our priorities where they ought to be. I think it's worth fighting for the Patients' Bill of Rights in the closing days of this congressional session.;Again, I want to thank the economic team here and our supporters in the Congress, including those who are here today, for giving more Americans a chance to live the story that Monique has told us about. I want to thank her for coming today and bringing her beautiful daughter. I know we all wish them well.;Our prayers are with the people who are about to be affected and those who have been affected by the hurricane. And I ask that all of us focus on using these last days of this congressional session to think about the American people, to think about our responsibilities, to think about what got us here over the last 6 years, and instead of departing from it, to bear down and build on it. That is my goal, and that's what we ought to do.;Thank you very much. Thank you.;Possibility of Impeachment Inquiry;Q. Mr. President, do you see any way out of an impeachment inquiry?;The President. Well, let me answer you this way: The right thing to do is for us all to focus on what's best for the American people. And the right thing for me to do is what I'm doing. I'm working on leading our country, and I'm working on healing my family.;And if you look at what we announced today, what does it tell you? It proves, number one, that the course we have followed has been the right course for America. That's what it proves. After 6 years, it can't be an accident anymore.;But the second thing it proves is that it is utterly foolish for people to be diverted or distracted from the urgent challenges still before us. I told you that we had a record—a record low in African-American unemployment and poverty, a record low in the poverty rate for children, of African-American children. Do you know what that record low is? It's about 39 percent. In other words, it's breathtakingly high. That's just one statistic.;So what does that tell me? It tells me that the right thing to do is, if we all put progress over partisanship, put people over politics, put the American people first—what would we do? Well, we would keep the budget balanced. We would save Social Security before we squandered the surplus. We would improve our schools. We would clean up our environment. We would pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. And we would keep the economy going. That's what we would be focused on. That's what I am focused on. That's the way out.;The way out here—and the only way out is for people in Washington to do what the folks in America want them to do, which is to take care of their concerns, their children, and their future. That's what I mean to do, and I'm going to do my best.</td></tr>

As we prepare for the impact of the storm on the mainland, we are working to bring relief to those already affected by the storm and to help them to begin rebuilding.;Yesterday I declared Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to be disaster areas. Already, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent over 200 emergency relief workers to assess the damage. I have sent Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo and Small Business Administrator Aida Alvarez to Puerto Rico to report to me on what further steps need to be taken. We are gravely concerned about the loss of life and property in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and will continue to work at the highest levels to bring the islands and their people back.;We are also working to help those affected outside our borders. Yesterday I sent an emergency response team from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, together with relief workers and supplies. I have asked Hugh Palmer, the head of Humanitarian Response Programs at the Agency for International Development, to go to the Dominican Republic this weekend to assess the damage, supervise our efforts, and report to me on what further should be done.;Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have felt the force of this storm.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Illicit Drug-Producing and Drug-Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">December 4, 1998</td><td class="c7">Dear;In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug-producing or drug-transit countries: Afghanistan, Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Burman, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.;This year I have removed Iran and Malaysia from the list of major drug producing countries and designated them as countries of concern.;Iran. On the list as a major drug producer since 1987, Iran has been a traditional opium producing country, with illicit poppy cultivation well beyond the statutory threshold limit of 1,000 hectares. A United States Government review in 1993 determined that there were at least 3,500 hectares of illicit opium poppy under cultivation in the country.;Over the past few years, the Government of Iran has reported success in eradicating illicit opium poppy cultivation. We were unable to test these claims until this year, when a United States Government review found no evidence of any significant poppy cultivation in the traditional growing areas. While we cannot rule out some cultivation in remote parts of the country, it is unlikely that there would be enough to meet the threshold definition of a major drug producing country.;Although important quantities of opiates continue to transit Iran en route to Europe, the United States Government currently has no evidence to support a judgment that significant quantities of these drugs are headed to the United States. Therefore, Iran is not a major drug-transit country under section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act.;Malaysia. Although Malaysia's geographic location makes it a feasible transit route for heroin to the United States, as had been the case in the past, we have no indication that drugs significantly affecting the United States have transited the country in the past few years.;I have further determined that the following countries or regions are of concern for the purpose of U.S. counternarcotics efforts;Netherlands Antilles. Though there is continuing drug activity taking place around the Netherlands Antilles, especially in the vicinity of St. Maarten, we have only anecdotal information that significant quantities of drugs bound for the United States are involved.;Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. I continue to be concerned about the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin moving through Turkey and neighboring countries (including Bulgaria, Greece, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia) to Western Europe along the Balkan Route. There is no clear evidence, however, that this heroin significantly affects the United States—as required for a country to be designated a major transit country.;Syria and Lebanon. I removed Syria and Lebanon from the list of major drug producers last year after the United States Government determined that there was no significant opium poppy cultivation in Lebanon's Biqa' Valley. A review again this year confirmed that there is still no evidence of significant replanting of opium poppy and no evidence that drugs transiting these countries significantly affect the United States. The relevant agencies continue, however, to monitor the situation.;Cuba. Cuba's geographical position astride one of the principal Caribbean trafficking routes to the United States makes the country a logical candidate for consideration for the majors list. Interdiction operations elsewhere in the region are driving drug smugglers increasingly to fly over Cuba to drop cocaine into Cuban and Bahamian waters. This trend makes it important for Cuba to take effective measures to stem the flow and to cooperate with others in doing so.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, they do not appear on this list because I have determined, pursuant to section 481(e)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act, that in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States, and thus such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Central Asia. United States Government agencies this year again conducted reviews of potential cultivation sites in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These reviews indicated no evidence of significant opium poppy cultivation.;Finally, I would note that geography makes Central America a logical conduit and transshipment area for South American drugs bound for Mexico and the United States, and that there has been evidence of increased trafficking activity in this region over the past year. Its location between Colombia and Mexico, combined with thousands of miles of coastline, the availability of a number of container-handling ports in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras, the presence of the Pan-American Highway, and limited law enforcement capability, have made the isthmus attractive to the drug trade. Hurricane Mitch has disrupted traffic flow through the region, but over the longer term resumption or even an increase in trafficking activity remains possible.;Consequently, I am concerned about drug trafficking through Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The appropriate agencies will continue to compile data on drug flows and their effect on the United States in order to determine whether any are major drugtransit countries. At the same time, I expressly reiterate my commitment to support the efforts of these governments to recover from the ravages of Hurricane Mitch, and to ensure that drug traffickers do not take advantage of this tragedy to make inroads into the region.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union</td><td class="c6">January 19, 1999</td><td class="c7">Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans: Tonight I have the honor of reporting to you on the State of the Union.;Let me begin by saluting the new Speaker of the House and thanking him especially tonight for extending an invitation to two guests sitting in the gallery with Mrs. Hastert: Lyn Gibson and Wenling Chestnut are the widows of the two brave Capitol Hill police officers who gave their lives to defend freedom's house.;Mr. Speaker, at your swearing-in, you asked us all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship. Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.;Tonight I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957.;For the first time in three decades, the budget is balanced. From a deficit of $290 billion in 1992, we had a surplus of $70 billion last year. And now we are on course for budget surpluses for the next 25 years.;Thanks to the pioneering leadership of all of you, we have the lowest violent crime rate in a quarter century and the cleanest environment in a quarter century. America is a strong force for peace from Northern Ireland to Bosnia to the Middle East.;Thanks to the leadership of Vice President Gore, we have a Government for the information age, once again, a Government that is a progressive instrument of the common good— rooted in our oldest values of opportunity, responsibility, and community, devoted to fiscal responsibility, determined to give our people the tools they need to make the most of their own lives in the 21st century—a 21st century Government for 21st century America.;My fellow Americans, I stand before you tonight to report that the state of our Union is strong.;Now, America is working again. The promise of our future is limitless. But we cannot realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull us into complacency. How we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depends upon what we do as a nation today. So with our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our confidence rising, now is the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century.;Our fiscal discipline gives us an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge, the aging of America. With the number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030, the baby boom will become a senior boom. So first, and above all, we must save Social Security for the 21st century.;Early in this century, being old meant being poor. When President Roosevelt created Social Security, thousands wrote to thank him for eliminating what one woman called "the stark terror of penniless, helpless old age." Even today, without Social Security, half our Nation's elderly would be forced into poverty.;Today, Social Security is strong. But by 2013, payroll taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly payments. By 2032, the Trust Fund will be exhausted and Social Security will be unable to pay the full benefits older Americans have been promised.;The best way to keep Social Security a rocksolid guarantee is not to make drastic cuts in benefits, not to raise payroll tax rates, not to drain resources from Social Security in the name of saving it. Instead, I propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save Social Security.;Specifically, I propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 years to Social Security, investing a small portion in the private sector, just as any private or State Government pension would do. This will earn a higher return and keep Social Security sound for 55 years.;But we must aim higher. We should put Social Security on a sound footing for the next 75 years. We should reduce poverty among elderly women, who are nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other seniors. And we should eliminate the limits on what seniors on Social Security can earn.;Now, these changes will require difficult but fully achievable choices, over and above the dedication of the surplus. They must be made on a bipartisan basis. They should be made this year. So let me say to you tonight, I reach out my hand to all of you in both Houses, in both parties, and ask that we join together in saying to the American people: We will save Social Security now.;Now, last year we wisely reserved all of the surplus until we knew what it would take to save Social Security. Again, I say, we shouldn't spend any of it, not any of it, until after Social Security is truly saved. First things first.;Second, once we have saved Social Security, we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve Medicare. Already, we have extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 10 years, but we should extend it for at least another decade. Tonight I propose that we use one out of every $6 in the surplus for the next 15 years to guarantee the soundness of Medicare until the year 2020.;But again, we should aim higher. We must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new ideas, including the upcoming report of the bipartisan Medicare Commission. If we work together, we can secure Medicare for the next two decades and cover the greatest growing need of seniors, affordable prescription drugs.;Third, we must help all Americans, from their first day on the job, to save, to invest, to create wealth. From its beginning, Americans have supplemented Social Security with private pensions and savings. Yet today, millions of people retire with little to live on other than Social Security. Americans living longer than ever simply must save more than ever.;Therefore, in addition to saving Social Security and Medicare, I propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century. I propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal savings accounts—USA accounts—to give all Americans the means to save. With these new accounts, Americans can invest as they choose and receive funds to match a portion of their savings, with extra help for those least able to save. USA accounts will help all Americans to share in our Nation's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement. I ask you to support them.;Fourth, we must invest in long-term care. I propose a tax credit of $1,000 for the aged, ailing or disabled, and the families who care for them. Long-term care will become a bigger and bigger challenge with the aging of America, and we must do more to help our families deal with it.;I was born in 1946, the first year of the baby boom. I can tell you that one of the greatest concerns of our generation is our absolute determination not to let our growing old place an intolerable burden on our children and their ability to raise our grandchildren. Our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give us an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulders, and we should take it.;Saving Social Security, Medicare, creating USA accounts, this is the right way to use the surplus. If we do so—if we do so—we will still have resources to meet critical needs in education and defense. And I want to point out that this proposal is fiscally sound. Listen to this: If we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for Social Security and 16 percent for Medicare, over the next 15 years, that saving will achieve the lowest level of publicly held debt since right before World War I, in 1917.;So with these four measures—saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, establishing the USA accounts, supporting long-term care— we can begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century seniors.;Now, there are more children from more diverse backgrounds in our public schools than at any time in our history. Their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire Nation to thrive in the new economy.;Today we can say something we couldn't say 6 years ago: With tax credits and more affordable student loans, with more work-study grants and more Pell grants, with education IRA's and the new HOPE scholarship tax cut that more than 5 million Americans will receive this year, we have finally opened the doors of college to all Americans.;With our support, nearly every State has set higher academic standards for public schools, and a voluntary national test is being developed to measure the progress of our students. With over $1 billion in discounts available this year, we are well on our way to our goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet.;Last fall, you passed our proposal to start hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early grades. Now I ask you to finish the job.;You know, our children are doing better. SAT scores are up, math scores have risen in nearly all grades. But there's a problem. While our fourth graders outperform their peers in other countries in math and science, our eighth graders are around average, and our twelfth graders rank near the bottom. We must do better. Now, each year the National Government invests more than $15 billion in our public schools. I believe we must change the way we invest that money, to support what works and to stop supporting what does not work.;First, later this year, I will send to Congress a plan that, for the first time, holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. My "Education Accountability Act" will require every school district receiving Federal help to take the following five steps.;First, all schools must end social promotion. No child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can't read. We do our children no favors when we allow them to pass from grade to grade without mastering the material. But we can't just hold students back because the system fails them. So my balanced budget triples the funding for summer school and after-school programs, to keep a million children learning.;Now, if you doubt this will work, just look at Chicago, which ended social promotion and made summer school mandatory for those who don't master the basics. Math and reading scores are up 3 years running, with some of the biggest gains in some of the poorest neighborhoods. It will work, and we should do it.;Second, all States and school districts must turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. That's the policy established in North Carolina by Governor Jim Hunt. North Carolina made the biggest gains in test scores in the Nation last year. Our budget includes $200 million to help States turn around their own failing schools.;Third, all States and school districts must be held responsible for the quality of their teachers. The great majority of our teachers do a fine job. But in too many schools, teachers don't have college majors or even minors in the subjects they teach. New teachers should be required to pass performance exams, and all teachers should know the subjects they're teaching. This year's balanced budget contains resources to help them reach higher standards.;And to attract talented young teachers to the toughest assignments, I recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarships for students who commit to teach in the inner cities and isolated rural areas and in Indian communities. Let us bring excellence to every part of America.;Fourth, we must empower parents with more information and more choices. In too many communities, it's easier to get information on the quality of the local restaurants than on the quality of the local schools. Every school district should issue report cards on every school. And parents should be given more choices in selecting their public school. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. With our support, on a bipartisan basis, today there are 1,100. My budget assures that early in the next century, there will be 3,000.;Fifth, to assure that our classrooms are truly places of learning and to respond to what teachers have been asking us to do for years, we should say that all States and school districts must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policies.;Now, let's do one more thing for our children. Today, too many schools are so old they're falling apart, or so over-crowded students are learning in trailers. Last fall, Congress missed the opportunity to change that. This year, with 53 million children in our schools, Congress must not miss that opportunity again. I ask you to help our communities build or modernize 5,000 schools.;If we do these things—end social promotion, turn around failing schools, build modern ones, support qualified teachers, promote innovation, competition and discipline—then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to create 21st century schools.;Now, we also have to do more to support the millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work. The most basic tool of all is a decent income. So let's raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next 2 years. And let's make sure that women and men get equal pay for equal work by strengthening enforcement of equal pay laws. [ Applause ] That was encouraging, you know. [ Laughter ] There was more balance on the seesaw. I like that. Let's give them a hand. That's great. [ Applause ];Working parents also need quality child care. So again this year, I ask Congress to support our plan for tax credits and subsidies for working families, for improved safety and quality, for expanded after-school programs. And our plan also includes a new tax credit for stayat-home parents, too. They need support, as well.;Parents should never have to worry about choosing between their children and their work. Now, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the very first bill I signed into law, has now, since 1993, helped millions and millions of Americans to care for a newborn baby or an ailing relative without risking their jobs. I think it's time, with all the evidence that it has been so little burdensome to employers, to extend family leave to 10 million more Americans working for smaller companies. And I hope you will support it.;Finally on the matter of work, parents should never have to face discrimination in the workplace. So I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is not right.;America's families deserve the world's best medical care. Thanks to bipartisan Federal support for medical research, we are now on the verge of new treatments to prevent or delay diseases, from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's to arthritis to cancer. But as we continue our advances in medical science, we can't let our medical system lag behind. Managed care has literally transformed medicine in America, driving down costs but threatening to drive down quality as well.;I think we ought to say to every American: You should have the right to know all your medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need a specialist, you should have a right to see one. You have a right to the nearest emergency care if you're in an accident. These are things that we ought to say. And I think we ought to say: You should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment, whether it's a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment, or anything else. I believe this.;Now, I've ordered these rights to be extended to the 85 million Americans served by Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health programs. But only Congress can pass a Patients' Bill of Rights for all Americans. Now, last year, Congress missed that opportunity, and we must not miss that opportunity again. For the sake of our families, I ask us to join together across party lines and pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.;As more of our medical records are stored electronically, the threats to all our privacy increase. Because Congress has given me the authority to act if it does not do so by August, one way or another, we can all say to the American people, "We will protect the privacy of medical records, and we will do it this year.;Now 2 years ago, the Congress extended health coverage to up to 5 million children. Now we should go beyond that. We should make it easier for small businesses to offer health insurance. We should give people between the ages of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into Medicare. And we should continue to ensure access to family planning.;No one should have to choose between keeping health care and taking a job. And therefore, I especially ask you tonight to join hands to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation proposed by Senators Kennedy and Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work.;We need to enable our public hospitals, our community, our university health centers to provide basic, affordable care for all the millions of working families who don't have any insurance. They do a lot of that today, but much more can be done. And my balanced budget makes a good downpayment toward that goal. I hope you will think about them and support that provision.;Let me say we must step up our efforts to treat and prevent mental illness. No American should ever be afraid—ever—to address this disease. This year we will host a White House Conference on Mental Health. With sensitivity, commitment, and passion, Tipper Gore is leading our efforts here, and I'd like to thank her for what she's done. Thank you. [ Applause ] Thank you.;As everyone knows, our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook them on cigarettes. Now, I ask this Congress to resist the tobacco lobby, to reaffirm the FDA's authority to protect our children from tobacco, and to hold tobacco companies accountable while protecting tobacco farmers.;Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare and other programs. You know, the States have been right about this: Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema, and other smokingrelated illnesses, the tobacco companies should. So tonight I announce that the Justice Department is preparing a litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and, with the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.;Now, if we act in these areas—minimum wage, family leave, child care, health care, the safety of our children—then we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to strengthen our families for the 21st century.;Today, America is the most dynamic, competitive, job-creating economy in history. But we can do even better in building a 21st century economy that embraces all Americans.;Today's income gap is largely a skills gap. Last year, the Congress passed a law enabling workers to get a skills grant to choose the training they need. And I applaud all of you here who were part of that. This year, I recommend a 5-year commitment to the new system so that we can provide, over the next 5 years, appropriate training opportunities for all Americans who lose their jobs and expand rapid response teams to help all towns which have been really hurt when businesses close. I hope you will support this.;Also, I ask your support for a dramatic increase in Federal support for adult literacy, to mount a national campaign aimed at helping the millions and millions of working people who still read at less than a fifth grade level. We need to do this.;Here's some good news: In the past 6 years, we have cut the welfare rolls nearly in half. You can all be proud of that. Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands of people. And our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work. I hope you will support it.;We must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of America, to build a bridge from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta to our Native American communities, with more support for community development banks, for empowerment zones, for 100,000 more vouchers for affordable housing. And I ask Congress to support our bold new plan to help businesses raise up to $15 billion in private sector capital to bring jobs and opportunities to our inner cities and rural areas with tax credits, loan guarantees, including the new "American Private Investment Company" modeled on the Overseas Private Investment Company. For years and years and years, we've had this OPIC, this Overseas Private Investment Corporation, because we knew we had untapped markets overseas. But our greatest untapped markets are not overseas, they are right here at home. And we should go after them.;We must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm. As this Congress knows very well, dropping prices and the loss of foreign markets have devastated too many family farms. Last year, the Congress provided substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in American agriculture. And I am ready to work with lawmakers of both parties to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance. I ask you to join with me and do this. This should not be a political issue. Everyone knows what an economic problem is going on out there in rural America today, and we need an appropriate means to address it.;We must strengthen our lead in technology. It was Government investment that led to the creation of the Internet. I propose a 28-percent increase in long-term computing research. We also must be ready for the 21st century from its very first moment, by solving the so-called Y2K computer problem.;We had one Member of Congress stand up and applaud. [ Laughter ] And we may have about that ratio out there applauding at home, in front of their television sets. But remember, this is a big, big problem. And we've been working hard on it. Already, we've made sure that the Social Security checks will come on time. But I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we need every State and local government, every business, large and small, to work with us to make sure that this Y2K computer bug will be remembered as the last headache of the 20th century, not the first crisis of the 21st.;For our own prosperity, we must support economic growth abroad. You know, until recently, a third of our economic growth came from exports. But over the past year and a half, financial turmoil overseas has put that growth at risk. Today, much of the world is in recession, with Asia hit especially hard. This is the most serious financial crisis in half a century. To meet it, the United States and other nations have reduced interest rates and strengthened the International Monetary Fund. And while the turmoil is not over, we have worked very hard with other nations to contain it.;At the same time, we have to continue to work on the long-term project, building a global financial system for the 21st century that promotes prosperity and tames the cycle of boom and bust that has engulfed so much of Asia. This June I will meet with other world leaders to advance this historic purpose, and I ask all of you to support our endeavors.;I also ask you to support creating a freer and fairer trading system for 21st century America. I'd like to say something really serious to everyone in this Chamber in both parties. I think trade has divided us, and divided Americans outside this Chamber, for too long. Somehow we have to find a common ground on which business and workers and environmentalists and farmers and Government can stand together. I believe these are the things we ought to all agree on. So let me try.;First, we ought to tear down barriers, open markets, and expand trade. But at the same time, we must ensure that ordinary citizens in all countries actually benefit from trade, a trade that promotes the dignity of work and the rights of workers and protects the environment. We must insist that international trade organizations be more open to public scrutiny, instead of mysterious, secret things subject to wild criticism. When you come right down to it, now that the world economy is becoming more and more integrated, we have to do in the world what we spent the better part of this century doing here at home. We have got to put a human face on the global economy.;We must enforce our trade laws when imports unlawfully flood our Nation. I have already informed the Government of Japan that if that nation's sudden surge of steel imports into our country is not reversed, America will respond.;We must help all manufacturers hit hard by the present crisis with loan guarantees and other incentives to increase American exports by nearly $2 billion.;I'd like to believe we can achieve a new consensus on trade, based on these principles. And I ask the Congress again to join me in this common approach and to give the President the trade authority long used and now overdue and necessary to advance our prosperity in the 21st century.;Tonight I issue a call to the nations of the world to join the United States in a new round of global trade negotiations to expand exports of services, manufactures, and farm products. Tonight I say we will work with the International Labor Organization on a new initiative to raise labor standards around the world. And this year, we will lead the international community to conclude a treaty to ban abusive child labor everywhere in the world.;If we do these things—invest in our people, our communities, our technology, and lead in the global economy—then we will begin to meet our historic responsibility to build a 21st century prosperity for America.;You know, no nation in history has had the opportunity and the responsibility we now have to shape a world that is more peaceful, more secure, more free. All Americans can be proud that our leadership helped to bring peace in Northern Ireland. All Americans can be proud that our leadership has put Bosnia on the path to peace. And with our NATO allies, we are pressing the Serbian Government to stop its brutal repression in Kosovo, to bring those responsible to justice, and to give the people of Kosovo the self-government they deserve.;All Americans can be proud that our leadership renewed hope for lasting peace in the Middle East. Some of you were with me last December as we watched the Palestinian National Council completely renounce its call for the destruction of Israel. Now I ask Congress to provide resources so that all parties can implement the Wye agreement to protect Israel's security, to stimulate the Palestinian economy, to support our friends in Jordan. We must not—we dare not—let them down. I hope you will help.;As we work for peace, we must also meet threats to our Nation's security, including increased dangers from outlaw nations and terrorism. We will defend our security wherever we are threatened, as we did this summer when we struck at Usama bin Ladin's network of terror. The bombing of our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reminds us again of the risks faced every day by those who represent America to the world. So let's give them the support they need, the safest possible workplaces, and the resources they must have so America can continue to lead.;We must work to keep terrorists from disrupting computer networks. We must work to prepare local communities for biological and chemical emergencies, to support research into vaccines and treatments.;We must increase our efforts to restrain the spread of nuclear weapons and missiles, from Korea to India and Pakistan. We must expand our work with Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet nations to safeguard nuclear materials and technology so they never fall into the wrong hands. Our balanced budget will increase funding for these critical efforts by almost two-thirds over the next 5 years.;With Russia, we must continue to reduce our nuclear arsenals. The START II treaty and the framework we have already agreed to for START III could cut them by 80 percent from their cold war height.;It's been 2 years since I signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. If we don't do the right thing, other nations won't either. I ask the Senate to take this vital step: Approve the treaty now, to make it harder for other nations to develop nuclear arms, and to make sure we can end nuclear testing forever.;For nearly a decade, Iraq has defied its obligations to destroy its weapons of terror and the missiles to deliver them. America will continue to contain Saddam, and we will work for the day when Iraq has a Government worthy of its people.;Now, last month in our action over Iraq, our troops were superb. Their mission was so flawlessly executed that we risk taking for granted the bravery and the skill it required. Captain Jeff Taliaferro, a 10-year veteran of the Air Force, flew a B-1B bomber over Iraq as we attacked Saddam's war machine. He's here with us tonight. I'd like to ask you to honor him and all the 33,000 men and women of Operation Desert Fox.;Captain Taliaferro. [ Applause ];It is time to reverse the decline in defense spending that began in 1985. Since April, together we have added nearly $6 billion to maintain our military readiness. My balanced budget calls for a sustained increase over the next 6 years for readiness, for modernization, and for pay and benefits for our troops and their families. We are the heirs of a legacy of bravery represented in every community in America by millions of our veterans. America's defenders today still stand ready at a moment's notice to go where comforts are few and dangers are many, to do what needs to be done as no one else can. They always come through for America. We must come through for them.;The new century demands new partnerships for peace and security. The United Nations plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our debts.;We must continue to support security and stability in Europe and Asia, expanding NATO and defining its new missions, maintaining our alliance with Japan, with Korea, with our other Asian allies, and engaging China.;In China, last year, I said to the leaders and the people what I'd like to say again tonight: Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty. But I'd also like to say again to the American people: It's important not to isolate China. The more we bring China into the world, the more the world will bring change and freedom to China.;Last spring, with some of you, I traveled to Africa, where I saw democracy and reform rising but still held back by violence and disease. We must fortify African democracy and peace by launching Radio Democracy for Africa, supporting the transition to democracy now beginning to take place in Nigeria, and passing the "African Trade and Development Act.;We must continue to deepen our ties to the Americas and the Caribbean, our common work to educate children, fight drugs, strengthen democracy and increase trade. In this hemisphere, every government but one is freely chosen by its people. We are determined that Cuba, too, will know the blessings of liberty.;The American people have opened their hearts and their arms to our Central American and Caribbean neighbors who have been so devastated by the recent hurricanes. Working with Congress, I am committed to help them rebuild. When the First Lady and Tipper Gore visited the region, they saw thousands of our troops and thousands of American volunteers.;In the Dominican Republic, Hillary helped to rededicate a hospital that had been rebuilt by Dominican s and Americans working side by side. With her was someone else who has been very important to the relief efforts. You know, sports records are made, and sooner or later they're broken. But making other people's lives better and showing our children the true meaning of brotherhood, that lasts forever. So, for far more than baseball, Sammy Sosa, you're a hero in two countries tonight. [ Applause ] Thank you.;So I say to all of you, if we do these things— if we pursue peace, fight terrorism, increase our strength, renew our alliances—we will begin to meet our generation's historic responsibility to build a stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.;As the world has changed, so have our own communities. We must make them safer, more livable, and more united. This year, we will reach our goal of 100,000 community police officers ahead of schedule and under budget. The Brady bill has stopped a quarter million felons, fugitives, and stalkers from buying handguns. And now, the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years and the crime rate has dropped for 6 straight years.;Tonight I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer. Our balanced budget will help put up to 50,000 more police on the street in the areas hardest hit by crime and then to equip them with new tools, from crime-mapping computers to digital mug shots.;We must break the deadly cycle of drugs and crime. Our budget expands support for drug testing and treatment, saying to prisoners: If you stay on drugs, you have to stay behind bars, and to those on parole: If you want to keep your freedom, you must stay free of drugs.;I ask Congress to restore the 5-day waiting period for buying a handgun and extend the Brady bill to prevent juveniles who commit violent crimes from buying a gun.;We must do more to keep our schools the safest places in our communities. Last year, every American was horrified and heartbroken by the tragic killings in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, Springfield. We were deeply moved by the courageous parents now working to keep guns out of the hands of children and to make other efforts so that other parents don't have to live through their loss.;After she lost her daughter, Suzann Wilson of Jonesboro, Arkansas, came here to the White House with a powerful plea. She said, "Please, please, for the sake of your children, lock up your guns. Don't let what happened in Jonesboro happen in your town." It's a message she is passionately advocating every day. Suzann is here with us tonight, with the First Lady. I'd like to thank her for her courage and her commitment. [ Applause ] Thank you.;In memory of all the children who lost their lives to school violence, I ask you to strengthen the Safe and Drug-Free School Act, to pass legislation to require child trigger locks, to do everything possible to keep our children safe.;A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt defined our "great, central task" as "leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us." Today, we're restoring the Florida Everglades, saving Yellowstone, preserving the red rock canyons of Utah, protecting California's redwoods and our precious coasts. But our most fateful new challenge is the threat of global warming, 1998 was the warmest year ever recorded. Last year's heat waves, floods, and storms are but a hint of what future generations may endure if we do not act now.;Tonight I propose a new clean air fund to help communities reduce greenhouse and other pollution, and tax incentives and investments to spur clean energy technology. And I want to work with Members of Congress in both parties to reward companies that take early, voluntary action to reduce greenhouse gases.;All our communities face a preservation challenge, as they grow and green space shrinks. Seven thousand acres of farmland and open space are lost every day. In response, I propose two major initiatives: First, a $1-billion livability agenda to help communities save open space, ease traffic congestion, and grow in ways that enhance every citizen's quality of life, and second, a $1-billion lands legacy initiative to preserve places of natural beauty all across America, from the most remote wilderness to the nearest city park.;These are truly landmark initiatives, which could not have been developed without the visionary leadership of the Vice President, and I want to thank him very much for his commitment here.;Now, to get the most out of your community, you have to give something back. That's why we created AmeriCorps, our national service program that gives today's generation a chance to serve their communities and earn money for college.;So far, in just 4 years, 100,000 young Americans have built low-income homes with Habitat for Humanity, helped to tutor children with churches, worked with FEMA to ease the burden of natural disasters, and performed countless other acts of service that have made America better. I ask Congress to give more young Americans the chance to follow their lead and serve America in AmeriCorps.;Now, we must work to renew our national community as well for the 21st century. Last year the House passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation sponsored by Representatives Shays and Meehan and Senators McCain and Feingold. But a partisan minority in the Senate blocked reform. So I'd like to say to the House: Pass it again, quickly. And I'd like to say to the Senate: I hope you will say yes to a stronger American democracy in the year 2000.;Since 1997, our initiative on race has sought to bridge the divides between and among our people. In its report last fall, the initiative's advisory board found that Americans really do want to bring our people together across racial lines.;We know it's been a long journey. For some, it goes back to before the beginning of our Republic, for others, back since the Civil War, for others, throughout the 20th century. But for most of us alive today, in a very real sense, this journey began 43 years ago, when a woman named Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Alabama and wouldn't get up. She's sitting down with the First Lady tonight, and she may get up or not, as she chooses. We thank her. [ Applause ] Thank you, Rosa.;We know that our continuing racial problems are aggravated, as the Presidential initiative said, by opportunity gaps. The initiative I've outlined tonight will help to close them. But we know that the discrimination gap has not been fully closed either. Discrimination or violence because of race or religion, ancestry or gender, disability or sexual orientation, is wrong, and it ought to be illegal. Therefore, I ask Congress to make the "Employment Non-Discrimination Act" and the "Hate Crimes Prevention Act" the law of the land.;Now, since every person in America counts, every American ought to be counted. We need a census that uses modern scientific methods to do that.;Our new immigrants must be part of our One America. After all, they're revitalizing our cities, they're energizing our culture, they're building up our economy. We have a responsibility to make them welcome here, and they have a responsibility to enter the mainstream of American life. That means learning English and learning about our democratic system of government. There are now long waiting lines of immigrants that are trying to do just that. Therefore, our budget significantly expands our efforts to help them meet their responsibility. I hope you will support it.;Whether our ancestors came here on the Mayflower, on slave ships, whether they came to Ellis Island or LAX in Los Angeles, whether they came yesterday or walked this land a thousand years ago, our great challenge for the 21st century is to find a way to be one America. We can meet all the other challenges if we can go forward as one America.;You know, barely more than 300 days from now, we will cross that bridge into the new millennium. This is a moment, as the First Lady has said, "to honor the past and imagine the future.;I'd like to take just a minute to honor her. For leading our Millennium Project, for all she's done for our children, for all she has done in her historic role to serve our Nation and our best ideals at home and abroad, I honor her. [ Applause ];Last year, I called on Congress and every citizen to mark the millennium by saving America's treasures. Hillary has traveled all across the country to inspire recognition and support for saving places like Thomas Edison's invention factory or Harriet Tubman's home. Now we have to preserve our treasures in every community. And tonight, before I close, I want to invite every town, every city, every community to become a nationally recognized "millennium community" by launching projects that save our history, promote our arts and humanities, prepare our children for the 21st century.;Already, the response has been remarkable. And I want to say a special word of thanks to our private sector partners and to Members in Congress of both parties for their support. Just one example: Because of you, the Star-Spangled Banner will be preserved for the ages. In ways large and small, as we look to the millennium we are keeping alive what George Washington called "the sacred fire of liberty.;Six years ago, I came to office in a time of doubt for America, with our economy troubled, our deficit high, our people divided. Some even wondered whether our best days were behind us. But across this country, in a thousand neighborhoods, I have seen, even amidst the pain and uncertainty of recession, the real heart and character of America. I knew then that we Americans could renew this country.;Tonight, as I deliver the last State of the Union Address of the 20th century, no one anywhere in the world can doubt the enduring resolve and boundless capacity of the American people to work toward that "more perfect Union" of our Founders' dream.;We're now at the end of a century when generation after generation of Americans answered the call to greatness, overcoming depression, lifting up the disposed, bringing down barriers to racial prejudice, building the largest middle class in history, winning two World Wars and the long twilight struggle of the cold war. We must all be profoundly grateful for the magnificent achievement of our forebears in this century. Yet perhaps, in the daily press of events, in the clash of controversy, we don't see our own time for what it truly is, a new dawn for America.;A hundred years from tonight, another American President will stand in this place and report on the state of the Union. He—or she—he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time but of their time, that we reached as high as our ideals, that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness, that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.;My fellow Americans, this is our moment. Let us lift our eyes as one Nation, and from the mountaintop of this American Century, look ahead to the next one, asking God's blessing on our endeavors and on our beloved country.;Thank you, and good evening.</td></tr>

Mr. President, distinguished members of the Ghanaian delegation, it's been a real pleasure for me to welcome President Rawlings back to Washington to advance the partnership between the United States and Ghana.;On my visit to Africa last spring, I said the United States wanted and very much needed a new partnership with Africa. We face stiff challenges: a border war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, civil wars in the Congo, Angola, Sierra Leone, famine and disease causing heartbreaking human loss. But it is important not to forget how far Africa has come since the days of apartheid and authoritarianism.;In a few days, we'll have an election in Nigeria to elect a President and to give the largest, most populous country in Africa a chance to chart a new course. Over half the countries of sub-Saharan Africa already have democratically elected governments. It is clearly in our interest to have a broad and constructive partnership.;Since Kwame Nkrumah led Ghana to independence in 1957, Ghana's example has inspired other nations to take control of their destinies. Over the past decade, Ghana has continued to lead the way, with a growing economy, with peacekeeping forces in west Africa and around the world, with its efforts to strengthen democracy at home.;Today President Rawlings and I are broadening our partnership. We're encouraging multilateral African forces to respond quickly to outbreaks of violence. We're providing more training for Ghana's battalion in the new African peacekeeping enterprise, the African Crisis Response Initiative. We're supporting Ghana's active role in stemming violence in west Africa through ECOMOG's regional peacekeeping force, as it seeks to stop the carnage that has racked Sierra Leone.;For our part, we have contributed logistical and medical support for peacekeeping troops there, and we will continue to do so. In fact, I want to increase our support for ECOMOG, and I hope Congress will support my proposal to do so. In the last 18 months, we have also provided over $75 million in humanitarian assistance to refugees and victims of violence.;President Rawlings and I also agreed on a number of steps to increase trade and investment between our nations. Tomorrow our U.S. Trade Representative will sign a trade and investment framework agreement with her Ghanaian counterpart. It will be only our second such agreement in Africa. Next month, here in Washington, 9 members of my Cabinet will meet with ministers representing more than 40 African nations to discuss ways that we can work together to expand development. I also hope Congress will soon take the next step by passing the "African Growth and Opportunity Act.;Finally, the President and I will continue to work together to fulfill the promise of democracy in Africa. Ghana already invests a phenomenal 40 percent of its budget in education. Today we announced that we will be sending new Peace Corps volunteers to help link Ghana's classrooms to the Internet. We're also working with Ghana to crack down on child labor, to train judges and lawyers mediating disputes, to fight HIV and AIDS while infection rates are still low there, to build a reliable power supply for the future, to study and preserve Ghana's elephant population and their environment, and to prepare for fair elections in the year 2000.;This partnership, indeed, covers a lot of ground. Our investment in Ghana and Africa is one of the most important we can make for the new century. This year we will offer over $800 million in economic support to Africa. We will augment this with a healthy program of bilateral debt forgiveness for Africa's strongest performing economies. Over a 2-year period, counting what we did last year, that bilateral debt forgiveness will be almost $500 million.;Africa cannot overcome all its challenges overnight. But make no mistake about it, there is a new Africa, growing proudly alongside its ancient traditions. Ghana is not the largest country in Africa, but it continues to lead toward tomorrow by the force of its example, by its commitment to democracy, by its steady economic progress, by its cooperation with its neighbors, by its willingness to take risks and make contributions for peace. Ghana is lighting the way forward, and we are proud to be here working to strengthen our partnership.;Mr. President.;President Rawlings. Thank you very much. Thanks for some parts of the good news. I wish you had told me about it earlier on. [ Laughter ];Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the press, this morning, at the ceremony on the White House lawn, I set out a rather modest agenda for my visit to the U.S. I'm happy to note that the discussions that we've had so far have been instructive from both sides. President Clinton has shown to us his sincerity and determination to forge ahead with a new era of cooperation with Africa.;We all agree that his trip to Africa last year represented the high point of official U.S. attention to and recognition of our continent. And I hope that Africa will continue to feature prominently on the foreign policy agenda of the U.S.;It is rather unfortunate that the stereotype image of Africa as a continent full of conflict, lack of democracy, et cetera, et cetera, continues to dominate the international media. And yet, there are many positive developments taking place on our continent. For example, in the past 5 years, some 21 African countries have achieved positive GDP growth rates, with 12 of them—including Ghana—reaching 45 percent a year. Democracy has taken root in many African countries, with emphasis on good governance.;And many of our countries have done the right things to create a favorable climate for foreign investment. In fact, Africa has demonstrated real promise as a destination for investment. Ladies and gentlemen, listen. The statistics show that between 1990 and '94, the average annual return on U.S. direct investment to Africa was 28—28—percent. This, compared with 11 percent in Europe, 12 percent in Latin America, and 14 percent in Asia—the Pacific areas.;Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude my very brief and introductory remarks by saying that Africa is a continent in transition. It is a continent facing challenges, and some of these have their roots in the bipolar politics of the cold war. But Africa could very well be the continent of the future. As you know, the Secretary-General of the U.N., Mr. Kofi Annan, put it succinctly the other day when he said that the conflicts and problems of Africa were caused by human action and can, therefore, be ended by human action.;We're here, ladies and gentlemen, as I said earlier on, to invite the United States of America to be part and parcel of that human action, to address the problem of hunger, poverty, debt, and conflict. Thank you.;President Clinton. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, what we will do is, we'll take alternating questions, one from the American press, one from the African press, and we'll begin with Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].;Independent Counsel Statute/Allegations of Misconduct;Q. Mr. President, would you like to see the independent counsel statute expire in June? And what is your reaction to recent allegations by an Arkansas woman, apparently of something she claims happened many years ago?;President Clinton. Well, my counsel has made a statement about the first issue, and I have nothing to add to it.;On the independent counsel law, I think that, as you know, we've been—I think you know, I think it's been public that we've been asked to testify, the White House Counsel has been invited to testify next week. And I presume sometime between now and then I'll have a chance to talk to them about what they intend to say.;I think for right now what I would like to say, because I have been, to put it mildly, closely involved with the operation of the statute, that I think I would like to leave the maximum amount of time for others to make their opinions known and to feel free, without any reference to anything we might say, to do that. I would encourage people who have views to make them known. And I was particularly struck by the change in position of the American Bar Association and by the size of the vote in favor of that different position. And I think it's just something that Congress should look at.;Q. Excuse me, but you do have some ideas about——;President Clinton. I do, I do have some——;Q. ——the loss of confidentiality.;President Clinton. I do. I have some ideas about it. But I think it would be better for me at this time to say less so that others can say more. The Counsel will be testifying at some point next week. But now I think the important thing is that everyone feel free to express their opinion, and I don't think mine should, in effect, cast a shadow or illuminate what others might wish to say between now and the time we make our statement.;Peacekeeping Force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;Q. My question is for both Presidents. There is a conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo—[ inaudible ]—is trying to negotiate a peaceful settlement. In the case that it reaches the point where it needed the contribution of troops for a peacekeeping force in the Congo, is, first, Ghana going to contribute troops to bring peace to the Congo? And also, is the United States going to contribute money and logistics for the peacekeeping in the Congo?;President Rawlings. If I may—do you mind, sir? You are no doubt aware that we have more than enough problems on our hands on the West Coast of Africa, and for the past—what— 10 to 15 years or so, we've been involved in the conflict issues in west Africa, mainly between Nigeria, Guinea, and Ghana. We've managed to find the appropriate solution to the problem in Liberia, and today we find ourselves also in Sierra Leone.;I must admit, though, that much as we've enjoyed some form of assistance from some of our Western allies, I don't think the assistance that has been provided has been adequate, and it's something we've always brought to their notice. But in our recent discussions with the Cabinet, under his leadership, they've made it quite clear that they'll do everything possible to assist us to be able to deal with some of the problems in west Africa.;As far as the issues to do with the Congo is concerned, I believe the U.S. is doing what you can by way of providing the necessary assistance to South Africa and a few other countries to find a solution to the problem in that part of Africa.;Should they be asking for troops from Ghana to serve in, what do you call it—Congo-Brazzaville——;Q. The Democratic Republic of Congo.;President Rawlings. Thank you very much. I have to say that our resources are stretched to the very limit. We have problems back at home. And if the U.N. or the international organizations and countries would want to assist us, we have a number of troops who would be prepared to assist, to provide a peacemaking as well as the peace—what do you call it— peacekeeping effort in that part of the country. Okay?;President Clinton. My answer to you sir is, first of all, I think we all have a stake in a resolution of the problems of the Congo. And if there were an appropriate peace signed that we felt to be consistent with the rules of the international community and the long-term stability and welfare of the people of the Congo, as well as its neighbors, I would certainly do my best to support any necessary force to maintain the peace for a period of transition, including logistical and other support.;I'm sure you know this, I mentioned it in my remarks, but for some years now, we've been trying to help establish an Africa Crisis Response Initiative, and help to support it financially, that would, in effect, go beyond the efforts of ECOMOG in west Africa, to deal with the whole continent. And when I was in Senegal last year, I actually went out to a training operation of the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, and I met with some of the soldiers, and I talked with our people about what we were doing together.;So I would be pleased. I also went to Rwanda last year and met with the leaders of the surrounding countries, the Great Lake countries, including Mr. Kabila. At that time, we were trying to—I was hoping we could avoid the bad year we've had in the Congo.;So if there could be an internationally recognized agreement, consistent with international law, that required a peacekeeping force, and we were asked to provide some sort of support, logistical and otherwise, I would be inclined to do so.;Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].;Kosovo Peace Negotiations/U.S. Foreign Policy Interests;Q. Mr. President, two questions. Last Friday you said it would be a mistake to extend the negotiating deadline for Kosovo. What made you change your mind in less than 24 hours? And how do you respond to former Secretary of State Kissinger, who says that Kosovo should be protected by European troops and not American troops? He wrote this week, "Kosovo is no more a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe, and we never asked for NATO support there.;President Clinton. Well, this is a good way to have a six-question, instead of a three-question press conference. [ Laughter ] Let me try to disaggregate those things.;First of all, what they did in the peace talks was to reach an agreement that they had gone as far as they could, but they did not want to give up and disintegrate into violence. So when we agreed to extend, we were basically agreeing to what both parties wished to do. It seems to me that if your objective is to get people to get together to make peace and they say, "We think this is what we need," I think that's the right thing to do.;Now, the Kosovars have agreed in principle to the agreement. They want to go home and have time to sell it between now and the middle of March. The Serbs have agreed, except they don't agree to having a multinational, NATOled peacekeeping force because they say there's a big difference between Kosovo and Bosnia. Bosnia was an independent country in which the Serbs had interests, Kosovo, they say, is a part of their country, so this erodes their sovereignty. The problem is that we believe, and all others, including the Europeans, who have been involved in this process, believe that unless there is some sort of multinational force, we cannot keep the peace.;So they've agreed to work on this between now and March 15th, and they're giving us some time to work on it to try to make it work, and I'm committed to do that.;Now, second point: I would say there is a difference between the interests of Europe in Haiti and the interest of the United States in Kosovo. And I don't mean—this does not diminish the importance of Haiti. We've worked very hard to save democracy in Haiti, and to support that country. But our country, for 50 years, has recognized that what we wanted in Europe was a Europe that was democratic, peaceful, and undivided. At the end of the cold war, we finally had a chance to achieve all three. But with the disappearance of repressive regimes and the threat of the cold war conflict, a lot of old ethnic, religious conflicts reasserted themselves.;Does the United States have an immediate, selfish interest in what happens on some lonely road in Kosovo to some poor farm family driving a wagon, with horses that are underfed because they haven't been able to get food? No. We have—I would argue we have a humanitarian interest. One of our major papers yesterday ran a gripping picture on the front page of a whole line of refugees moving out.;But the United States does have a direct interest in whether there is instability in the Balkans. And I would say to Dr. Kissinger, I think we're moving in the right direction. We want Europe to assume more of its own defense. And if you compare where we were in Bosnia— how long it took to get there, what our role was, our contribution in the beginning of the Bosnia operation—to where we are in Kosovo on this military proposal—how much more quickly it materialized, and our contribution, only about 14 percent, I think, of the total— I think we're moving toward more of an independent European force, but supported by the United States, because we have a very large stake in anything that upsets the stability of central Europe.;Support for the President's Africa Initiative;Q. It's obvious that Africa does not play a major role in terms of the minds of the people of the United States, as we can gather now that no questions have been asked about Africa.;President Clinton. You shouldn't take it—it often happens with Asians and Latin Americans and—[ laughter ]—and it's really my fault because I don't let them ask me enough questions on other occasions, so I'm forcing them to use this opportunity to pepper me. I apologize. [ Laughter ] So go ahead.;Q. It's obvious that you and your Government have very good intentions towards Africa. But how are you going to "conscientize" Congress and the American people to be able to support your efforts in Africa?;President Clinton. Well, first of all, that's a very good question. We talked about that at great length in our meeting today. We spent as much time on that as anything.;Let me say, I see this as a multiyear effort, long-term effort. It started when we had the first-ever White House conference on Africa here. And we're about to have this ministerial, as I said, next month, with at least 40 African nations represented—very high levels. I was the first President ever to take a really long trip to sub-Saharan Africa and to go to six countries.;We're trying to increase both—not both, all three—aid, trade, and investment and bilateral debt relief. We are working on demining activities, which is very sensitive and important in many parts of Africa. We're working especially hard on health-related issues and particularly HIV and AIDS, where that's a big problem.;And meanwhile, we're trying to lift the profile of Africa in the United States. There is actually quite a lot of interest among ordinary citizens here. The Africa trip I took last year, particularly since it got off to such a good start, when a half million people showed up in Accra—[ laughter ]—and most of our people—Presidents are not used to having half a million people. [ Laughter ] If I get 10,000 or 20,000 here, it's a big show. [ Laughter ].;But the point is, it captured the imagination of the American people. And we also had a good delegation from Congress there. And tonight, at the state dinner, we will have a delegation from Congress, a sizable delegation, which will include both African-Americans and non-African-Americans. It will include both Democrats and Republicans.;This is not going to be—we were isolated from Africa for a long time, except for cold war concerns, as you know. And we are trying to have a broad, deep, full relationship now. And it is simply not going to happen overnight, we're going to have to work at building it.;But I want you to be encouraged. I think we're moving in the right direction. And I have been very heartened by the genuine interest I have gotten from Members of Congress, from both parties and all kinds of backgrounds. I have been trying to tell them that this is a phenomenal opportunity, as well as obligation, for the United States, we've been missing it, and we don't need to miss it anymore. And I think that we're moving in that direction.;President Rawlings. It is true that when this issue came up I did a lot of talking about, engaging about this issue, almost sounding like a priest. [ Laughter ] And at the end of it, the response I got was that there are other ones that you should be talking to this way. I mean, those who you should be talking to this way were outside of this room, outside of this Cabinet. And in other words, they are very much in agreement with our perceptions about Africa's problems, what the problems are and what the solutions ought to be. So in effect, it's hard to take this message outside of that Cabinet, to the broader American public, to Members of Congress, et cetera, on both sides of the aisle.;President Clinton. To be fair, what the President said here in his opening statement in some ways is the most important thing you can say to Americans who are not involved in Africa.;This is not simply a continent with problems, it's a continent with promise. Our investments in Africa, American investments in Africa, have earned a rate of return more than twice the rate of return earned by American investments the last 5 years in Europe, Asia, or Latin America. That is quite a stunning statistic.;And you can say, "Oh, well, it's because it's just the beginning of investment," or, "Oh, well, the best opportunities are there." You can make all the excuses you want, 30 percent is 30 percent. [ Laughter ] And that's real money, you know? Even by the standards of the last 5 years, that's a hefty rate of return.;I did tell—after the President was pounding on me to do better by Africa, I did say, I said, "Reverend Rawlings, you're preaching to the saved." [ Laughter ] "You should just pass the plate, you know." He was preaching to the saved. [ Laughter ] But it's a very important point. I don't blame him, or you, for asking this question.;But you have to understand, too—I know the cold war has been over 10 years now, I know that. But I also would call your—I would like to say one other thing, briefly, I said to the delegation earlier. The end of the cold war presented the United States with a new circumstance that required us to take an approach different from the approach we had taken for 200 years. For 200 years, our principal involvement with other countries was commercial or cultural, unless attacked. Then in the 20th century, we got into World War I because our ideals were offended and because our allies were in trouble in Europe. We immediately withdrew from the world, with disastrous consequences. One of the reasons that we had the Great Depression and we had World War II is that the United States in its idealism walked away from the world.;So then we had World War II, and then we had the cold war, a reason for America to stay in the world. For the last 10 years, it is the first time in the history of the United States that we have had a sustained, comprehensive commitment, bipartisan, to have a larger role in the world—in peacetime, without our existence being threatened—which means we learned something from what happened between World War I and World War II, and we understand that America is a country where people here come from everywhere, and we know we have unique responsibilities because of the blessings we enjoy at this moment in history. But it is a new moment for us, and we are still learning how to do it.;That is not an excuse. I know when you see a child die of AIDS, or you see a child step on a mine in Angola, or you see an economic opportunity going unfulfilled, or you think that we could help you to end a war more quickly, I know it's frustrating. But our friends in Africa have to understand what we have been doing for the last 10 years is unique in more than 200 years of history for us. And I think we'll get it right and do the right thing, but it requires a certain departure that I think most people who don't know the history of our country have difficulty accepting.;Go ahead, Larry [Larry McQuillan, Reuters].;President Rawlings' Budget/Iraq;Q. President Rawlings, your domestic critics say that your budget proposal for the coming year has been unrealistically optimistic, and I'm just wondering if you might like to take this opportunity to respond to that.;And President Clinton, on Iraq—[ laughter ].;President Clinton. I thought you were going to ask me the first question. [ Laughter ] Go ahead.;Q. There's been another incident again today. And this certainly seems to be an ongoing recurrence. And I'm just wondering if, perhaps, you can clarify for us what the U.S. policy objective is on Iraq? And have we given up all hope of any kind of arms inspections again?;President Rawlings. Please. I don't think there's anything unrealistic about what the Minister of Finance—and it's not just the Minister of Finance, but it's the whole Cabinet, under the chairmanship of the Presidency, myself, as well as the Vice President, do a very thorough examination of the pros and cons of what's coming in and what's going out, et cetera, and on the basis of which, we do a very thorough examination of what will come and what will not. And it's on the basis of this that we come out with the budget statement for the country.;And please accept it when I say that we've gone through an experience where, unlike governments of the past, we did not make the mistake of—what do you call it—taking politically expedient moves just to deal with some economic problem. Because ultimately it's going to catch up with us, and this is what has happened in the past. And this is a lesson we learned more than 10, 15 years ago.;I mean, it's been very difficult for us in the past, every time we've had to read the budget, but then we take the trouble to educate our people about what it entails, what it means, what the difficulties are going to be, et cetera.;But you've got to keep in mind that the minute our people under—very often—I think I understand where you're coming from—very often, whenever people do not understand or appreciate what is being churned out in a broadcast, then of course, I mean, they wonder what you're talking about. But if you can reduce it to the lowest denominator and then they understand what it all entails, they are all for you. That's half the problem, that's half the solution that's solved. And that's what we do, not just with our civilian counterparts, the workers in the factories, but soldiers, officers, et cetera, in the barracks, et cetera. The minute they understand it, that's half the problem.;Now, if you're telling me this on account of what you are reading on the Internet, it's unfortunate that we're not as quick, as efficient to correct misimpressions—is that the word?—or distortions on the Internet, as others do ahead of us. I wish we were just as efficient as they are on the Internet—[ laughter ]—then you wouldn't be asking me this question. [ Laughter ];We have a Finance Minister—wait a minute—who started off as the Energy—he made a success of it—no, before the Energy— Transport and Communication, he made a success of it. From there we moved him to Lands and Forestry, he made a success of it, from there to Energy—no, Energy and to do with the gold mine—Mines and Energy, he made a fantastic success of that one. And that's how he ended up as the Minister of Finance. A man of integrity, earnestness, he sits with a crosssection of the people, from the top right down to the bottom—workers, union leaders, et cetera—and lays everything on the table.;And that is what we need in Africa. That's what we've been doing in Ghana. That's how come we've survived this long, because we don't hide anything from anybody. We lay everything on the table.;So if you're putting this question across to me, please, attribute it to those who just cannot accept the earnestness, the sincerity of this government. Is that okay? [ Laughter ] No, if I haven't finished, please feel free, you can come back.;President Clinton. On Iraq, you asked two questions. Let me take the second question first.;No, we have not given up on the prospect of restoring inspections. But since Saddam Hussein terminated his cooperation with UNSCOM and then the military action was taken by the United States, Great Britain, with the support of our allies, they have continued to defy the U.N., and that's where we are now. That brings us back to your first question.;What's going on with these incidents is that under the United Nations resolutions, which are still in place, the no-fly zone still exists. The no-fly zone has to be patrolled. When it is patrolled by American and British pilots, from time to time, as you pointed out, there have now been several instances when Israeli air defense—excuse me, Iraqi air defense weapons have been fired at our airplanes. And they're trying, obviously, for the symbolic victory of shooting one of these planes down, and perhaps trying to intimidate us from enforcing the nofly zone, which we're still bound to do under the United Nations resolution.;Now, in response to that, we have certain rules of engagement which permit us to take out the air defense. And we have done quite a lot of it. I noticed there was one column in the press in the last week—I think it was Mr. Seib's [Jerry Seib, Wall Street Journal] column—but anyway, it was a column which pointed out that a significant amount of damage, perhaps as much damage or more, has been done to the air defense network since the end of the last military action than was done during the military action, where we had a lot broader range of targets we were going after.;And I regret this, you know. I regret this. I wish he would stop doing that. I wish he would make an agreement with the United Nations to let the inspections go back. We have shown that we are not interested in hurting the Iraqi people. We have been for broader rules for meeting the nonmilitary needs of the people of Iraq, and we will continue to work at that.;But these little encounters—each of them so far has been relatively small—are as a result of the fact that we are still, notwithstanding the fact that the inspectors aren't there, bound to enforce a no-fly zone which still exists under the U.N. resolutions.;Debt Relief for African Nations;Q. This question is to President Clinton. In recent years, there's been much talk about the need for debt cancellation, and the general feeling among African countries is that this is one surest escape route towards economic development. I would like to hear your comments on it.;President Clinton. I'm sorry. I'm hard of hearing. Could you repeat—the debt cancellation issue?;Q. Yes.;President Clinton. Well, I believe that debt relief is appropriate, in Africa and in certain other places, particularly in view of the countries in—some of the countries in Asia that have been so hard hit by the financial crisis. I think that debt relief, frankly, though, only works if it is accompanied by a longer term commitment to a sound economic policy.;If you look at the astonishing results that Ghana has produced over a period of years— steady growth, good years and bad years, some years are better than others—but you've enjoyed steady growth. You've had a steady political environment that has also become steadily more democratic, not steadily more repressive, moving in the right direction.;I think that it is unlikely that a lot of these countries can really resume significant growth without debt relief. But I do not believe debt relief alone will bring them their growth. That's my position. I'm for more debt relief. The United States is sponsoring—as I said, we will have, in Africa alone, almost $500 million in debt relief this year and last year, if Congress approves my proposal. We also have contributed another $50 million in this budget as our contribution to a larger international debt relief effort.;And I think we can do more. But it is essential for some countries, but it is not enough. So we need debt relief plus trade and investment, plus aid, plus good economic policies within the country. You have to have all of them, I think, to maximize African growth.;Let's take one more. John [John King, Cable News Network].;Cooperation With Congress;Q. Sir, both the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader left their meeting with you yesterday and refused to answer directly when we asked them outside if they could trust you after the events of the past few months. Was that your sense in the meeting? And if that is the case, how do you hope to accomplish anything in your final 22 months?;President Clinton. Well, the answer is, that was not my sense. I thought it was a good meeting. Because of what they went through with their own Members, that's a difficult question for you to ask them. And no matter what answer they give, it causes them more problems than it solves. You guys are great at asking me those questions, too.;But I mean, keep in mind, they're the leader of—they have to lead their caucuses in the House and the Senate. So that sort of question, at the time when some of the nerves are still raw, any answer they give makes it more difficult for them, potentially, at least, within their caucus or within the country, depending on what answer they give.;So I think the answer ought to be, the answer they ought to give and the answer they ought to have deeply imbedded in their minds and hearts is that their feelings are not important here—just like my feelings are not important. We have an oath to fulfill, a responsibility to fulfill. We were hired to do the public's business, and they expect us to do it.;You know, it would be hard to imagine a year that was more strained than last year, and we got a lot done. It was a good year, legislatively. We continued—we passed our second balanced budget, we passed the legislation to provide for 100,000 teachers, with almost a third of them paid for in the downpayment, and lots of other things.;So I think we're now in a period—this is early in the legislative calendar, they have a new leader in the House, they have a lot of work to do, they have to get a budget resolution through. And then we have probably, oh, I don't know, 8 or 10 bills that I can conceive of us getting agreement on—I mean, really significant bills, a lot of them—between the two parties.;And then we've got these big questions of what to do about Social Security, Medicare, whether I'm right, they're right, something else is right on the tax cut issue. There are big questions out here. And I believe that we will all do our duty in the end, that's what I think. And I just think we need to—if we focus on the American people and doing our duty, and not on whether we're mad or happy, disappointed or elated about the events of the last year, then all this in the course of time will work itself out. And the American system will be validated.;We—if you take a position like the ones we've taken, it is simply wrong for you to think about what your feelings are. Your responsibility is to fulfill your oath and do what the public needs. And if we focus on that, we'll be just fine.;Dual Citizenship;Q. President Rawlings, I think I'm on the wrong side of the room. I apologize, but I have a question for you.;President Rawlings. I understand. Actually, I was actually briefed that most of the questions would be directed at the President. [ Laughter ] I was made to understand that, don't be surprised if most of the questions are related to American domestic situations and not the fact that I'm here from Africa. Thank you. Carry on, please. [ Laughter ];Q. Well, I've heard that Ghana is offering some sort of dual citizenship to African-Americans. Is that true? What does it mean, and what's the reasoning behind it?;President Rawlings. It's very true. Sorry, do you mind if I—is it something connected to the question?;President Clinton. Answer this one, and then if you want to call on him, it's fine.;President Rawlings. Very soon, our Parliament will be passing the bill to grant black Americans their dual citizenship, as far as Ghana is concerned, and you'll have the right of dual abode.;Q. What does it mean?;President Rawlings. What does it mean?;Q. Yes.;President Rawlings. You wouldn't need a visa, you wouldn't need whatever it is to enter my country. You will have the freedom to move around as any fellow Ghanaian, and that will not deny you your American citizenship, either.;Q. What's the reasoning behind it?;President Rawlings. What's the reason behind it?;Q. Yes.;President Rawlings. Do German-Americans, do Israeli-Americans—are they denied the right of their citizenship back at home? No, no, please, if I'm wrong, can you correct me?;Q. I don't know. [ Laughter ];President Rawlings. Quite frankly, I mean, I could go on and on. But the point is that, I mean, you're our kith and kin. If others can refer to themselves as Jewish Americans or German-Americans or Irish-Americans, whatever it is, Italian-Americans, and you're calling yourself African——;Q. Americans.;President Rawlings. ——whatever it is. [ Laughter ] I mean, where do you come from? After all, I mean, my continent is the mother of—what do you call it?—not all continents but humanity and civilization as we've come to know today. I mean, is there any reason why you should not have the right to enjoy the citizenship of where you come from?;President Clinton. I'm just sorry I can't do it. [ Laughter ] I don't qualify. [ Laughter ];President Rawlings. No, no, wait a minute, sir. Hold on, Mr. President. [ Laughter ] No, no. You're not going to explain this for me. [ Laughter ];Let's put it this way. I'm rather surprised that you're asking me this question. I should be asking you, I mean, how on God's possible— whatever it is—could you be asking me a question like this? [ Laughter ] Because, I mean——;Q. Would it be dual loyalty?;President Rawlings. Well, I guess that's what we have a bit of—we don't have any problem with that. I think—when I look into that issue, I have a problem with you, because you're demanding loyalty to the American Constitution, and yet I cannot demand the same kind of loyalty to my country. And this is where I'm beginning to have a problem. But nonetheless, there's no reason why I will deny my fellow black African the right to enjoy the citizenship as I enjoy as an African.;President Clinton. Let me just try to—the general rule is that dual citizenship laws are, by definition, controlled by the citizenship conditions of both countries. And it's not unheard of for Americans to have dual citizenship.;Interestingly enough, after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, we've had American citizens who had roots, for example, in the Baltic States. One went home to his country and became the Ambassador. I don't know if he had to give up his American citizenship, or not. It would be a function of the law. But there are— and the laws operate differently in different countries. But almost all countries allow some form of dual citizenship.;Now, second thing is, the President didn't mention this, but if Ghana does this, it certainly won't hurt in trying to get more Americans interested in Ghana, going to Ghana, and contributing to Ghana's future. I thought it was quite a clever idea myself. [ Laughter ];Thank you very much.;President Rawlings. No, no, no. Hold on, Mr. President. [ Laughter ] On one condition—that if you fall foul of the laws and regulations of my country, the—what do you call it?—the judiciary, the police, and the laws of my country will take their course without the American Government attempting to intervene, to say, this is a citizen of my country.;President Clinton. I think that's what the rule is.;President Rawlings. Thank you, sir.;President Clinton. There's a whole lot of law on that. I think that's the rule.;Thank you.;Q. I want to say to you something.;President Rawlings. Yes, sir.;Q. You know, we the people——;President Rawlings. Yes sir.;Q. ——of African descent that are Latino, are ready, willing, and able to cooperate with Africa—[ inaudible ]—and our experience, the President of the Dominican Republic, and I, as a Cuban-American, reside here for—[ inaudible ]—are ready and willing to help you in the African initiative. And I guarantee you with my friend of the Republican Party is going to give me 100 percent support for the initiatives of the President of Africa—[ inaudible ]. So you have the cooperation of the Latinos, like the Jewish have for their people in Israel.;President Clinton. Thank you.</td></tr>

First, President Arzu, let me thank you, your government, and the people of Guatemala and especially the people of Antigua for the wonderful welcome and hospitality I have received here.;When Hillary came back from her trip to Central America last November, she told me about the devastation she had seen in four nations, but she also said, "At the end of the trip, you have to go to Antigua.;You know, this is the first time the President of the United States has been anywhere in Guatemala outside of the airport in Guatemala City. President Johnson visited there 30 years ago. This visit is long overdue. More importantly, this moment in history is long overdue.;I came to the Presidency in 1993 determined to establish a new partnership with the peoples of Latin America and especially to reach out to our neighbors in Central America. At long last, Guatemala and all its neighbors have a chance to prosper in freedom and peace, in a hemisphere united by shared values.;We have come together in this old capital to find new solutions. The damage the hurricanes left, some of which I have seen, of course, has increased the urgency of our deliberations and our action. We are determined to respond to this calamity so that what was destroyed will be built back better than ever. We commit today to build a common future here in Antigua, a city that knows a great deal about rebuilding.;Our challenge is to consolidate the remarkable achievements of Central America in the last decade, to build on them, and to accelerate them.;I am committed to lowering trade barriers between us, both to speed recovery and to build a free-trade area in this region that will benefit all the citizens of all the countries. I am committed to a common struggle against violence and drug trafficking and drug abuse, to shared responsibility for the care of our environment, for the education of our children, for the health of our people. I am committed to justice and to institutions which will maintain it. I am committed to fair immigration laws, fairly enforced, and especially to the principle that we should treat people from Central America equitably, whatever their country of origin, and recognize the special circumstances of those nations that Hurricane Mitch hit hardest.;Our new partnership has made quite a bit of progress since our last summit in Costa Rica. We still face daunting challenges. But now we face them with a unique sense of solidarity and a common commitment to freedom, to democracy, to open markets, and to meeting the demands of our people for better schools, safer streets, wider opportunities.;Even before the United States was created, a North American poet, Anne Bradstreet, complained about the harshness of our weather. But she added, "If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant." Well, Central America has had a long and difficult season, aggravated by the recent hurricanes, but we can truly rejoice that the springtime of renewal and rebuilding is here. The Sun shines on us today, in Guatemala and throughout this region. For all the problems that people face, we must never forget how far they have traveled, and we must never lose sight of the path that leads to a brighter tomorrow. We must go on that path together, to build a new American century for all the people of the Americas.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Clinton: Declaration of Antigua</td><td class="c6">March 11, 1999</td><td class="c7">We, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, the United States of America, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, and the Prime Minister of Belize, meeting in Antigua, Guatemala, on March 11, 1999, welcome the special opportunity afforded by this meeting to secure a prosperous future for our peoples after the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges.;Hurricane Mitch was the worst disaster in the history of our Hemisphere, killing nearly 10,000 people, affecting at least 6 million others, and causing property damage totaling approximately $6 billion. Aware of the enormous impact on our countries of this disaster, we are meeting to combine efforts to rebuild and transform the region in such a way as to bring swifter development that will ensure the prosperity of all our citizens.;For the first time in the history of our region, all our countries are enjoying peace, stability, democracy, and freedom. Preserving these achievements requires decisive, forward-looking action in order to avoid jeopardizing the stability of our countries achieved through great sacrifice and to stay on the course of progress.;In a spirit of solidarity, the Central American Presidents gathered for a special, emergency meeting in Comalapa, El Salvador, on November 9, 1998, to appeal to the international community for solidarity and to adopt joint decisions on how best to coordinate our efforts to help one another in the task of rebuilding and transformation.;Despite the tragedy we face, we recognize that the current situation also offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct our economies, transform our societies, and lay the economic foundation for sustained growth to prepare our nations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. With our own efforts and with the staunch, sustained support of the international community, we will overcome the challenges ahead.;The Central American nations and the Dominican Republic deeply appreciate the strong show of support, generosity, and solidarity to our peoples, and the valuable cooperation and emergency assistance provided by the international community. We take this opportunity to express particular gratitude for the speedy, timely response of the people and the Government of the United States of America. The President of the United States of America reiterates his commitment to contribute efforts to transform and rebuild Central America and the Dominican Republic.;Reconstruction and Transformation;We welcome the opportunity this Summit offers to intensify the frank dialogue we began in San Jose. We reaffirm the values we share as peoples and nations, based on democracy, the free market, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the effective rule of law, the campaign against international crime, and our commitment to environmental protection.;Based on these values, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, the United States of America, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and the Vice President of Guatemala, met in Washington, D.C., on December 11, 1998, to agree on mechanisms to rebuild and transform the region, and at that time received encouraging support and solidarity from the people and the Government of the United States of America.;Aware that our efforts should be complemented by long-term support from financial institutions, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, and the Vice President of Guatemala, met in Washington, D.C., on December 10-11, 1998, to report to the international community, at the Consultative Group convened by the Inter-American Development Bank, on the magnitude of the damage and to establish mechanisms for effective coordination with donors, thereby ensuring the resources necessary to begin the difficult task of rebuilding and transforming our countries.;We agree that the effective, lasting transformation of the region means enhancing democracy, promoting sustained economic growth as the best antidote for poverty, strengthening the rule of law and national reconciliation, ensuring the full effectiveness of human rights, strengthening judicial systems and good governance, fostering transparency, combating international crime, approaching in a humane manner the issue of migration, expanding trade and investment opportunities, supporting debt relief and financial cooperation, and implementing a program of sustainable development that includes natural disaster prevention.;The Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, and the Prime Minister of Belize, reaffirm our determination to achieve the rapid rebuilding and transformation of our countries with a view to establishing prosperous societies with equal opportunity for all.;We agree to underscore the importance of obtaining, during this initial rebuilding phase, non-reimbursable funds and concessionary lines of credit to finance programs in those areas most essential for economic, agricultural, and industrial recovery and for the reintegration of the people affected into the productive life of our countries. To that end, the Presidents of Central America and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize express appreciation for the request for special funds for rebuilding Central America that President Clinton sent to his Congress, and again call upon the international community and international financial institutions to lend their firm support to the efforts to rebuild Central America.;Debt Relief and Financial Cooperation;The Presidents of Central America and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize welcome the commitment by the President of the United States of America to provide debt relief to Nicaragua and Honduras, whose economies were especially devastated by Hurricane Mitch. Debt relief is critical to building a sustainable path to development for these countries as they work to rebuild and transform their economies.;The Presidents of Central America and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize view with approval the support provided by the United States of America within the Paris Club to extend a moratorium on debt servicing for Honduras and Nicaragua over the next two to three years, which will free up vital resources for reconstruction and transformation efforts. The President of the United States of America reiterated his commitment to play a leadership role in providing comprehensive external debt reduction for Honduras and Nicaragua under the Paris Club and consideration of eligibility under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. In addition, the President of the United States has requested authority for a $25 million contribution to the Central America emergency trust fund in order to help pay debt service to the international financial institutions.;The President of the United States of America expressed his determination to support and contribute to both bilateral and multilateral initiatives, in order to obtain the maximum additional resources needed on an urgent and concessionary basis at the May 1999 meeting of the Consultative Group in Stockholm, Sweden. That meeting will be a pivotal event in donor coordination and in confirming pledges of resources for the reconstruction and transformation of the region. The Presidents of Central America and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize expressed their appreciation for the determination by the United States of America to increase substantially bilateral aid programs for the reconstruction of their countries.;Trade and Investment;We recognize that the formulation of a comprehensive program of reconstruction and economic recovery for the region in the wake of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges would be incomplete without the consideration of trade and investment as essential components for economic development, regional integration, and prosperity. It is through commercial opportunities generated by better and more secure markets that sustainable development, long-term political and economic stability, and, therefore, widespread human development in the region can be achieved. We recognize that creating incentives for increased trade and investment will be advanced by our adherence to commitments agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations such as in the World Trade Organization.;Two-way trade between the United States of America and its neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean has grown rapidly in this decade and has been highly beneficial for both sides. This reflects the continued success and relevance of the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) in promoting greater trade flows and investment and generating employment in the United States of America as well as in the region. Free market economies and private sector participation are essential to rebuilding our countries, consolidating democracy, and promoting closer economic relations. As we approach the new millennium, we are determined to rededicate our commitment to open markets and to strengthen even more this mutually beneficial relationship.;We are aware of the importance of strengthening relationships that have developed in the areas of textiles and clothing, not only because of the enormous benefits for the United States of America and the nations of the Caribbean Basin, but also as a way of ensuring our mutual competitiveness in the context of the world market as we approach the year 2005.;President Clinton expressed his determination to work actively with the United States Congress to enhance the Caribbean Basin Initiative in a manner that responds effectively to the needs of the countries of the region. These enhancements should help prepare for the creation of a region of shared prosperity among Central America, the Dominican Republic, and the United States of America.;We welcome President Clinton's commitment to send the Bilateral Investment Treaties with El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to the United States Senate for ratification. These treaties send a positive signal of the region's openness to foreign investment and its determination to protect property rights and to forge a partnership with business to rebuild and transform the economies victimized by Hurricane Mitch.;The leaders praised the excellent beginning to the negotiations for the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The governments of the United States of America, the Central American countries, and the Dominican Republic affirmed their commitment to work together to achieve concrete progress in the FTAA negotiations, including by implementing a series of business facilitation measures. For this purpose, the governments will consult on cooperative efforts they can undertake to help the countries of the region to advance in this direction. In this regard, we highlight transparency as an important element of the FTAA process. We, therefore, look forward to the ongoing work of the Committee of Government Representatives on the Participation of Civil Society.;Migration;We recognize that the effects of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges on Central America and the Dominican Republic have caused suffering for their population and have further complicated social and economic conditions for an adequate reintegration of their repatriated citizens. In this regard, the Presidents of the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic and the Prime Minister of Belize express appreciation for the temporary measures already taken by the Government of the United States of America aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of repatriations to the region, and we reaffirm our commitment to maintaining dialogue at the highest level with a view to finding humane and permanent solutions to the problems of migration.;Taking into account the origins, manifestations, and social, economic, and political effects of migration, and bearing in mind the interdependence of our countries, the Government of the United States of America will consider initiatives to address the disparities created by the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA). We recognize that migrants contribute to the development and prosperity of their region of origin and of their new country of residence and also recognize that, in order for these benefits to be realized, migration should be orderly. We will also cooperate to address disorderly emigration and its consequences. We affirm our belief that longterm reconstruction, investment, trade, and assistance should include joint efforts to create sustainable employment opportunities that would provide alternatives to the need for future emigration.;We recognize the difficulties some repatriated citizens face as they reintegrate into their countries of origin and the socioeconomic implications this may entail for their countries. For this reason, we will pay special attention to the matter and will explore and encourage the adoption of new and comprehensive cooperative measures to ensure that they are treated appropriately, such as the signing of prisoner transfer treaties and memoranda of understanding on deportation procedures, to facilitate the reintegration of repatriated persons, with special emphasis on their well-being and on respect for their dignity and human rights.;We reiterate that illicit trafficking in persons is an affront to human dignity and reaffirm our commitment to increase cooperation in order to combat and punish this abominable practice. We commend the adoption of new laws in several countries against illicit trafficking in persons and urge other countries to implement similar measures. Our governments will continue multilateral cooperation in the Regional Conference on Migration and in other fora in order to exchange information and coordinate actions on migration matters in our countries. We will seek to establish mechanisms to share information and mutually collaborate to stop the organized smuggling of persons.;Democracy, the Rule of Law, and Human Rights;We applaud the achievement in the region of peace with harmony, mutual cooperation, and full respect for human rights. The end of internal conflicts in Central America has opened the way to reconciliation and the establishment of just, equitable societies that provide better opportunities for our peoples.;At this time of challenge and renewal, we reaffirm our commitment to continue the process of profound transformation, meeting the needs of our pluralistic democracies, based on strict respect for human rights, the effectiveness of the rule of law, mutual respect, the strengthening of local governments, and a more equitable and participatory civil society. We will continue doing our utmost to achieve economic well-being and the comprehensive development of our countries, and to preserve social peace, progress, and stability. We will also continue observing and promoting the rights of workers, including the elimination of any exploitative forms of child labor, in accordance with our respective Constitutions and with the Conventions of the International Labor Organization, as respectively ratified by our governments. In addition, working together within the Summit of the Americas process and the Organization of American States, we will endeavor to strengthen democracy and to increase prosperity throughout the Hemisphere.;We will work together to restore and create greater opportunities for the population affected by the hurricanes and to meet their needs with alacrity in order to prevent regional security from being threatened by the establishment of criminal networks. We will continue enhancing cooperation among our countries in the campaign against drug trafficking and organized crime.;We reaffirm our determination to bolster mutual legal assistance and information sharing arrangements that will deny safe haven to criminals. We support the modernization of extradition treaties and their vigorous application, within the legal framework of each country, to prevent impunity and to ensure that criminals are severely punished, in accordance with the severity of the crime committed. We will continue to modernize our laws against drug trafficking and money laundering and jointly seek opportunities to assist one another, through education, training, and technical support to prevent drug abuse. For these purposes, we are intensifying our efforts to execute the plan of action developed from the San Jose Summit.;Sustainable Development;The economic reconstruction of Central America and the Dominican Republic must address basic priorities such as reducing poverty, ensuring human development, and satisfying basic human needs with a sustainable management of natural resources. The region's sustainable development depends on overcoming obstacles such as imbalances in patterns of production, consumption, and human settlement, accelerated population growth, and high levels of poverty.;We have before us an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild the region and create jobs through domestic and foreign investment. We also have the opportunity of investing wisely, using sustainably our natural resources to ensure the well-being of present and future generations.;We recognize that global climate change has the potential to cause more frequent and severe natural disasters and thus recognize the need for all Parties to meet their responsibilities under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Industrialized countries should reduce their emissions and developing countries should participate meaningfully in global efforts to address climate change.;We underscore the continuing leadership of Central America in advancing implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the evolution of the Clean Development Mechanism for implementation of climate-friendly projects, including clean energy development and the enhancement of carbon sinks. Building on the commitment of the San Jose Declaration, we recognize the importance of the actions that are being developed in Central America with the participation of our private sectors, especially those that will permit the concession of credits and other initiatives that will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.;Recognizing the impact of climatic disturbances in the region, we agree that key components in the mitigation of disasters and in sustainable development include improved management of watersheds, reforestation, preservation of coastal wetlands, and efforts to prevent soil erosion through improved farming practices. It is, therefore, important to strengthen mechanisms of cooperation in the areas of natural disaster prevention and mitigation through education, training, institutional strengthening, and the transfer of technology.;We, the Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, the United States of America, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, and the Prime Minister of Belize, express our sincere gratitude for the hospitality shown to us by the people and Government of Guatemala during our sojourn in this historic city.</td></tr>

This legislation represents a major step toward a goal that the Congress established for the Peace Corps in 1985, and that I reaffirmed in January 1998: expanding the Peace Corps to 10,000 volunteers. This is an important day in the history of the Peace Corps, and I wish to thank the many Members of the Congress who helped make passage of this legislation possible. I also wish to congratulate Mark Gearan for his leadership and outstanding work as the Director of the Peace Corps.;The Peace Corps and the women and men who serve our country as volunteers embody some of our finest traditions and values—a spirit of service, a strong sense of altruism, and an enduring commitment to make the world a better place. Peace Corps volunteers have touched the lives of many people in more than 130 countries, and every American can take great pride in their service.;This bill will help ensure that many more of our citizens can offer their skills and serve our country as Peace Corps volunteers. This legislation is a strong statement of our Government's continued, bipartisan support for the work of our volunteers and their contributions to international understanding. In particular, I thank Senators Jesse Helms, Joseph Biden, and Paul Coverdell, who served as Director of the Peace Corps under President Bush, and Christopher Dodd, who served as Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic. I also express my appreciation to Representatives Ben Gilman, Sam Gejdenson, Tom Campbell, David Bonior, Donald Payne, and Earl Pomeroy. I also want to express my gratitude to the other returned Peace Corps volunteers who have continued their service to our country as Members of Congress: Representatives Tony Hall, Sam Farr, James Walsh, Christopher Shays, and Tom Petri.;Finally, I wish to thank the thousands of Peace Corps volunteers who are serving our country around the world. At the end of this fiscal year, more volunteers will be serve overseas than at any time in the last 25 years. Our country owes you a debt of gratitude for your service.;WILLIAM J.

Clinton: Interview With Jesse Jackson of CNN's "Both Sides" in Torrance</td><td class="c6">July 9, 1999</td><td class="c7">New Markets Initiative Tour;Mr. Jackson. Welcome to "Both Sides." Last week there was a phenomenal mission across our Nation led by President Clinton—a kind of journey from Wall Street to Appalachia to the Delta to Indian reservations to Watts to south Phoenix, across the country, building that bridge to share the wealth, the growth, the prosperity—called a new markets initiative. This week we have as our very special guest, our esteemed Mr. President, President Bill Clinton. Welcome.;The President. Thank you.;Mr. Jackson. In this trip last week—Hazard, Kentucky, Appalachia, the Delta, East St. Louis, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, south Phoenix, Watts, Anaheim—what stuck out in your mind the most?;The President. That in all those places where our prosperity has not reached, there are good people, smart people, people with dreams, and good opportunities for American business. This is a moment when we can do what is morally right, to give everybody a chance to walk into the 21st century together, and do it in a way that will actually be good for the American economy and good for the people who invest there.;Mr. Jackson. They've missed this booming prosperity. Is something wrong with the people?;The President. I wouldn't say something's wrong with the people. A lot of them don't have as much education as they need, and that's part of our strategy to do better, and they're going to have to have specific job training skills. But what happened is that all these places either never had a self-supporting economy, or the basis of economic life which once was there moved away, and nothing was ever brought in to replace it. And now, we've got a chance just to keep our own economy going, just to keep our own economy going with no inflation, we have a chance to bring investment to these areas, put these people to work, give them better lives, and in the process, help everyone else in America.;Mr. Jackson. But last week there were Republican and Democratic Congresspeople on the trip, there were corporate business leaders, Democratic and Republican.;The President. Yes.;Mr. Jackson. They seem to have found a common accord on this idea of new markets. The War on Poverty seemed to—would have been divisive: poverty, reaction, affirmative action, division, reaction. But new markets seem to have bound Appalachia and Delta, black, white, red. What's kind of magic about this notion of new markets initiative?;The President. Well, first of all, it's not charity, it's a hand up, not a handout. Secondly, the people who are being asked to invest in these new markets should do so with the expectation that they will actually make a profit out of it, that by helping people in areas which haven't participated in this prosperity, by starting businesses, giving people jobs, having these job training programs, they'll actually make money.;Mr. Jackson. So it's a kind of war for profits, not just a war on poverty?;The President. That's right.;Mr. Jackson. And therefore, you incentivize broadening the base of investment?;The President. We're not asking anybody to do anything that isn't a good business decision. It's a good business decision, and that's one of the things—you know, we saw that everywhere. Every place we went—do you remember that little—that first place we visited in Appalachia, a guy starts out with 40 employees, a few years later, he's got 850. And yes, you know, Appalachia's fairly isolated, but he makes those parts and—those various component electronic parts—and he's got 850 people. He's fixing to expand again because of the incentives that he has in our empowerment zone program that the Vice President's run for us for the last 6 years. That's the kind of thing we want to go nationwide with.;We believe if we give, in the new markets initiative, if we give the same tax credits and loan guarantees to Americans to invest in America's new markets we give them to invest in new markets in Africa, Latin America, Asia, or the Caribbean, that our people will do very well.;Mr. Jackson. You take, for example, the black and brown market alone is maybe $800 billion in consumer power. How has corporate America—what has been missing? How have they missed these markets—markets, money, talent— right under their noses?;The President. I think there are two reasons. I think, first of all, they've been doing very well by doing what they're used to doing and expanding in ways they're used to expanding, so our economy's grown quite a lot in the last 6 years.;Mr. Jackson. Even though they've missed markets?;The President. Yes, by taking the nearest thing at hand, the thing they're used to doing. Secondly, I think that there is something that the economists would call, in purely economic terms, imperfect knowledge. That is, I think that a lot of people really don't know how well they could do if they gave people in inner-city America, in rural America a chance. I think they just don't know. Which is one reason that it was so important that these business leaders went on the trip. You know—remember, when we started out, the chief CEO of Aetna life insurance company said, "You know, I may not be happy about this, because I had this deal figured out, and now all my competitors are going to know there's money to be made out here.;Mr. Jackson. So something about imperfect knowledge and our cultural blindness, we just don't even look toward those unexplored markets.;The President. Well, when you see a place so depressed for so long, or you see the figures and the education levels low, or you look at the maps in and out of a place and you realize it's physically isolated, and you think, "I've got all these other ways to make money that are near at hand," you don't get around to it. But now, the unemployment rate in America has been under 5 percent for 2 years. Everybody is wringing their hands, you know, from Wall Street out here to California, about how can we keep this economic growth going without inflation. The answer is invest in these places.;Mr. Jackson. It's interesting, in politics there's a zero-sum game. You have 435 Congress seats, you might change faces, but the seats don't change, and so it's forever tight and competitive. But in economics, inclusion leads to growth.;The President. That's right.;Mr. Jackson. And it seems that they have missed growth. In baseball, for example, we thought we had a great major leagues before we let Jackie Robinson and Campanella and Hank Aaron and Willie Mays in. But once they opened up the market, they now will go to Cuba, they'll go to the Dominican Republic and find Sammy Sosa, they'll go to Japan. The basketball team, now we'll go to Yugoslavia, go to Croatia—that the baseball owners seem to have gotten it, the basketball owners seem to have gotten it, now the rest of corporate America must get that inclusion leads to economic growth.;The President. And the important thing in your sports analogy is that as we have broadened the pool of talent, we've had more teams. There are now more baseball teams than there used to be. There are more basketball teams than there used to be. More people get interested as you broaden the pool of talent, and you get more people in. That's what is happening here.;So that if somebody invests in these new markets, they don't have to quit investing where they were. This is not a zero-sum game. You're right, we'll just widen the circle of opportunity.;Mr. Jackson. But why are they so much more likely, say, to invest in Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea, Eastern Europe, than in Appalachia or East L.A., in south Phoenix? What is the incentive factor there?;The President. I think that we look at Indonesia—let's just take Indonesia. We look at Indonesia, and we say, "Gosh, there's a market of 200 million people. It's the biggest Muslim country in the world, fairly moderate country historically, although they've had some problems lately, and we'll invest there and we'll sell to that market.;What we miss in America is that if you put people who are unemployed to work in distressed areas, you create a new market, first. Second, as you just pointed out, even in places with very high unemployment—if you go into an inner-city neighborhood with 15 percent unemployment, that's high, that's 3 times the national average plus. That still means 85 percent of the people are working there, they've got money to spend. In almost every city in America in the inner-city areas, the people have more money to spend than they can spend in their neighborhoods.;Mr. Jackson. That means breaking down stereotypes. For example, if you look at Hazard, Kentucky, you look at Watts, most poor people are not on welfare.;The President. They're working.;Mr. Jackson. They work every day, and most are not black or brown, they're white——;The President. That's right.;Mr. Jackson. ——female, young, invisible. So perhaps when you speak of markets, you kind of transcend the color/cultural barriers that divide and make people terribly anxious.;The President. Yes, I think that's really important. One of the things that we've felt, I think, all of us in this week, is that—like there in the Mississippi Delta, we were walking down the street in Clarksdale—you've got an African-American Congressman and a white mayor, and they're working together. I met in a store with an African-American woman and a Chinese grocer who had been in that community for 40plus years. This is a way of bringing people together. It's about much more than money. It's about cementing a quality and fabric of life that is absolutely essential.;Mr. Jackson. What is it about this period that allowed this mission to go from Hazard, Kentucky, Appalachia, to Clarksdale, Mississippi, to the reservation, and yet there was no evidence of racial rancor or division? What was it about this period that allowed at least that body of people to look toward another agenda, another formation of problem solving?;The President. First of all, I think the American people—it's a great tribute to the people in those areas that they've kind of gotten beyond that, and they understand that if they can build a common economic framework, they can build a home together in their communities.;Secondly, I think the business leaders who went, the political leaders who went were genuinely intelligent, savvy, and human people who saw that they could do the right thing and do very well.;Mr. Jackson. You know, when you were speaking to the Native Americans in Pine Ridge, and one of the corporate business leaders looked out, and he saw the 7,000 people, and he said, "I've always just seen Indian reservations"— which meant something—but he said, "Now, I see two supermarkets. I see a car dealership. I see 7,000 people wearing clothes. I see a market." He had never seen them as a market, he'd just seen them as Indians.;The President. Yes, and a lot of these people, if we put more stores, for example, in these Native American areas and hired the people there to work in the stores, then even in— and they're the poorest parts of America, they have the highest unemployment rate—but if you get their unemployment rate just down to 20 percent, then you have 80 percent of the people working and you make a whole market. So by creating the jobs, you create the market to buy the products that the jobs provide.;Mr. Jackson. What I thought was kind of mystical to me, frankly, was when we left Appalachia and got to Memphis, and after we had eaten at the Blues Cafe and had big fun eating much too much——;The President. We did that.;Mr. Jackson. ——and you, on one of your sleepless nights, decided we were going to go to the Lorraine Motel. We went through this whole museum, Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. We ended up in the spot that Martin Luther King was killed, and there you stood, and we prayed, and there was a somber spirit.;But what struck me about it was that what you did this past week was to fulfill Dr. King's last great mission. He knew that slavery was the race gap, denial of public accommodations, the race gap—we won that public accommodations bill—the lack of the right to vote, the race gap.;We now argue that that was a resource gap, it was a North-South resource gap, not just a race gap. So his last great movement was to pull together people from Appalachia, Al Lowenstein, Jewish allies from New York, Hispanics from the farm workers, from Chavez, he pulled all these groups together, and that was his last great mission, was to tour these areas to focus on a shared resource gap. So in some sense, this week, you've fulfilled that last leg of his journey.;The President. If we can make that so, I would be very proud, because he was right about that. You know, it's funny how much time we lost as a country after he and Senator Kennedy were killed, because both of them were trying to—I remember when Bobby Kennedy went to Appalachia, went to the Indian reservation in Pine Ridge in '68. They understood that the last shreds of our racial problems would be mired forever in our economic insecurities until everybody has a chance to make it. And now, our country has this phenomenal prosperity for which we are very grateful, but interestingly enough, it is becoming the enlightened self-interest of the investor community to keep this thing going, to finally——;Mr. Jackson. Sow profits, not fear.;The President. That's right. Finally, to give all these folks a chance to play again.;Mr. Jackson. Now that you have put the light on it—I mean, a Presidential entourage creates that—you put focus on America's underserved markets, its underutilized talent, untapped capital. We saw in Clarksdale, Mississippi, a man and his wife, both of whom are Stanford graduates, MIT engineers, graduates——;The President. Yes.;Mr. Jackson. ——selling McDonald's.;The President. McDonald's, yes.;Mr. Jackson. Very talented people, and that was—they found a niche there. But now, you put light. What must the Congress do to make this real? And then what must the business sectors—we have focus, we need legislation, and we need business. What's the next two pieces?;The President. Congress should do two things. First of all, they should fund the second round of these empowerment zones, because in the empowerment zones, we give special tax incentives for people to put business there and to hire people from there, and we give the communities extra money to educate and train people— first thing. And the Vice President's done a great job of managing that program. In addition to that, we have some more money for these community development banks. They give capital to first-time business people who couldn't get it other places. That's the first thing.;The second thing that Congress should do is to pass the new markets legislation which, as I said, basically gives American businesses the same incentives to invest in poor areas, urban and rural, in America that we today give them to invest overseas.;Mr. Jackson. What do we give them overseas?;The President. Well, we give them tax credits, we give them loan guarantees, we give them other things to try to lower the cost of capital.;Mr. Jackson. OPIC and the like?;The President. Right. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank.;Mr. Jackson. So you propose APIC—American Private Investment——;The President. American Private Investment Companies, and here's how it would work.;Mr. Jackson. Do you think it would pass, likely to pass?;The President. I think so. I mean, the Republicans ought to love it because it's a tax incentive thing, you know, it's not a big Government program. But here's how it would work. Suppose you and I were trying to build a shopping center development in East St. Louis, where we visited, and suppose the costs of that were—I'm making this up—about $300 million, and suppose we could raise $100 million in capital. Well, if we could do that, we could get a 25 percent tax credit with that $100 million investment, which takes our risk down to $75 million right off the bat. We've only got $75 million at risk, not $100 million. We could then go borrow the other $200 million from the bank with a Government guarantee on the borrowing, which would dramatically cut the interest rates and save us another several million dollars over the life of the project.;Mr. Jackson. So you've got tax incentive, investment incentive, and loan guarantees and markets.;The President. That's right. So, first of all, you've got a profit opportunity. We're not asking anybody for charity here. If there's no opportunity there, don't do it. But if there is an opportunity but you're worried a little about the risk, we will cut the relative risk of this investment, as compared with others, with the tax incentives and loan guarantees. It's a real good deal.;Gun Control;Mr. Jackson. We've found, in each of these markets, invariably two new buildings, a new ball park and a new jail. In all of these schools where we visited, the schools were unwired. Those in the jails, 90 percent are high school dropouts, 92 percent are functionally illiterate. The question of lack of education can breed the crime thing.;Senator Bradley put an article in the Post this week about proposals to reduce guns. Just briefly, he says that we should ban the distribution and sale of "Saturday Night Specials," registration for all 65 million handguns, a licensing and safety course for everyone who owns guns, ban gun dealers from selling guns in residential neighborhoods, insist on mandatory gun locks. Are these commonsense measures from your point of view?;The President. Sure. You know, we've got the gun locks provision in the Congress, and that still might pass. But I have said, we ought to have registration. We register our cars. If your car gets stolen while you're doing this interview with me, and somebody drives it halfway across the country and leaves it in a parking lot— let's say in Lincoln, Nebraska—and the police find it, as soon as you report your car stolen, it will go into an international computer system. As soon as he, the person who finds your car in Lincoln, Nebraska, says, "Here, I've found this stolen car, and here is the license plate and the registration," within 30 seconds, the local police in Chicago will be able to call you and say, "Reverend Jackson, we found your car." And so, of course we should do these things.;Mr. Jackson. So the drive to reduce easy access to guns and gun registration and gun education become factors in reducing the——;The President. Yes. And I think it's interesting—I think the NRA ought to support this. I don't think it's in their interest what they're doing, because nobody's trying to say we shouldn't have hunting and sport shooting. And if I were, they never listen to me, obviously, but I used to work with them sometimes in Arkansas. One of the best things they ever did were their hunter education programs, and they really try to teach young people to safely use firearms. Why shouldn't we say, if you're going to have a gun and you're a young person, you ought to be licensed and you ought to be taught how to use it, they would teach it.;Mr. Jackson. But you don't hunt rabbit with AK-47's.;The President. No, you don't. Well, we ought to ban those. You know, I'm in favor of getting rid of all that and all those big clips and all that kind of stuff. But if they have those guns, they ought to be able to use them, and NRA ought to be out there certifying teachers to teach them. If somebody steals your gun, you ought to be able to find it, just like your car. Then the other thing I disagreed with them about, we ought to close the loophole on selling these guns at gun shows and flea markets in big cities so that the same background checks are done. These background checks work, we keep those guns out of the wrong hands by doing that.;Hillary Clinton's Possible Senate Candidacy;Mr. Jackson. In this dialog, we've talked about all of the easy stuff, I mean, how to wipe out poverty without wiping out the poor, how to begin to close the resource gap and the skills gap. Now, the ultimate question: Is Hillary going to run for the Senate? [ Laughter ];The President. I honestly don't know. She's having the time of her life in New York this week, and the people have been very good to her. And if she decides to do it, I will strongly support her in every way I can. She would be a fabulous Senator if she decides to do it. I honestly don't know what she's going to do, but she's obviously interested in it. If the people of New York were to vote for her and elect her, she would be magnificent.;Mr. Jackson. So you don't think the Presidential issue will last in the heat of the campaign?;The President. No, I didn't say that. I think that she believes that it's a legitimate issue, at least, she believes that if she presents herself as a candidate, she would have to demonstrate to the voters of New York that she understands the State, that she is capable of learning about all the local issues, that she cares about them as well as the big national things on which she and I spent our lives. And so that's why she's up there on her listening tour. And she's going to go back every week this summer.;Mr. Jackson. How do you think she has done this week on her listening tour? Because she's had to do some talking while listening.;The President. I come back at night from our tour—I'd come back at night and flip on the TV and see what she had done, and I think she's done really well. I'm really proud of her. If this is what she wants to do, I'm 100 percent for it.;Mr. Jackson. When do you think she will decide?;The President. I think she wants to complete this—I think she at least wants to complete her summer schedule and listen to these folks and assess where she thinks it is. But I'm happy for her. It's a very exciting thing.;New Markets Initiative Tour;Mr. Jackson. Let me say to you, I thank you for this interview. This trek around America was most historic this week because we measure our strength politically by following opinion polls about how well Wall Street is doing, but you made the point over and over again that in the end you measure character by how you treat the least of these. And your dissatisfaction with 15 million children in poverty and 40 million without health insurance, your discomfort level with the poverty-stricken is a great moral statement and challenge for all of us.;I hope that in this season that we can, in some bipartisan basis, move from the bickering racial battleground to economic common ground, a kind of—I lived in Mississippi and saw whites and blacks on a shared economic security agenda, you know, Patients' Bill of Rights and increased teacher pay and cut the infant mortality rates. I mean, it seemed that is—this is a certain pregnant moment with possibility that all of us should seize.;The President. You know, the thing that was so touching to me—and we got out there in the country—you know, there were a lot of Republicans with us as well as Democrats, and in these areas we went, we met a lot of Republicans as well as Democrats.;These issues, these sort of common ground economic issues—I don't think there are partisan issues out there in America, and if we can keep them from becoming a partisan issue in Washington, then I'm going to reach out to the leadership of the Republican Party in Congress next week to talk to them about this trip and ask them to help me pass something that will really make a difference out there.;Mr. Jackson. So beyond the historic economic petitions and political petitions and racial petitions, you see this bridge building as ultimately your legacy, building bridges to the underserved, the unutilized, and the untapped.;The President. Yes. I think that this country ought to go whole into the new century, and we can't do it if not everybody has a chance to make a living, get an education.;Mr. Jackson. Well, thank you, Mr. President.;The President. Thank you. Thank you for going with me. You were fabulous.</td></tr>

Clinton: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">July 21, 1999</td><td class="c7">The President. Please be seated. Good afternoon.;Q. Mr. President, you don't know it, but there is such a bright light on you—[ inaudible ]—we can't see you for the light. [ Laughter ];The President. I've been waiting a long time for the halo to appear. [ Laughter ];Let me say, ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief opening statement, but before I make that and take questions, I'd like to say that, as you might imagine, I have been briefed on this morning's developments in the search off Martha's Vineyard. Again, let me commend the Coast Guard and all the officials at the local, State, and national level for the fine work they have done under extremely difficult circumstances.;Again, I think we should keep our thoughts with the families as events unfold, and my thoughts and prayers are with them.;Today I want to make a brief statement about the choice we face here in Washington and in our country about how best to move forward into the new century and what to do with the surplus.;When we look toward the future, it is helpful to remember at least the recent past. Six and a half years ago, the budget deficit was $290 billion and rising. Wages were stagnant, inequality was growing, social conditions were worsening. In the 12 years before I took office, unemployment averaged more than 7 percent. It's almost difficult to remember what it was like. No one really thought we could turn it around, let alone bring unemployment to a 29-year low, or turn decades of deficits, during which time the debt of our country was quadrupled in only 12 years, into a surplus of $99 billion.;Our Nation has made a seismic shift in the last 6 years, from recession to recovery, from a crisis of confidence to a renewal of resolve, from economic disorder to a fiscal house finally in order. Now, as we debate what to do with our prosperity, we face a critical choice, whether to move forward with the fiscal discipline that got us to where we are today or return to the kind of risk taking that got us into recessions and deficits before.;We must decide whether to invest the surplus to strengthen America over the long term, or to squander it for the short term. I think the right course is clear. And a bigger surplus only means that the mistake could be bigger and the missed opportunity greater if we take the wrong course.;I have proposed a balanced budget that puts first things first. I believe we must maintain our sound economic strategy and invest the surplus in long-term goals: saving Social Security, saving and strengthening Medicare, modernizing it by providing a long-overdue drug benefit, and continuing to meet our basic responsibilities in education, defense, the environment, biomedical research.;Tomorrow I will release a report that shows a great and growing need for prescription drug coverage. What the study shows is that 75 percent of our older Americans lack decent, dependable private-sector coverage of prescription drugs, that's three out of every four seniors. Clearly, America needs a prescription drug plan that is simple, universal, and voluntary. Anyone who says we don't, I believe, is out of date and out of touch.;As I've described, my plan meets these national priorities, while paying off the debt by 2015, while investing in America's new markets, the places that have not yet felt our prosperity, and while providing substantial tax relief, $250 billion of it targeted to help families save for retirement, pay for child care, long-term care, for modern schools.;So let's be clear about something. We're not debating whether to have tax cuts or not. We should have tax cuts, but tax cuts that provide for us first to save Social Security and Medicare, not undermine them, tax cuts we can afford, not ones that would demand drastic cuts in defense, education, agriculture, the environment, tax cuts in the national interests, not special interests.;Now, these are the risks that are posed by the Republican tax plan that the House is about to vote on. Let me tell you what their plan would do. It would pile up $3 trillion in debt over the next two decades, right when the baby boomers start to retire—that's what it costs— right when Social Security and Medicare feel the crunch.;Because of the cost of the tax plan over the next two decades, I should say what it doesn't do. It doesn't do anything to extend the solvency of Social Security, to extend the solvency of Medicare, to provide the prescription drug benefits, and it would require significant—significant—cuts from where we are today in education, defense, biomedical research, the environment, and other critical areas.;If we don't save Social Security, it's not because we can't. If we don't strengthen Medicare and add the prescription drug benefit, it's not because we can't. If we don't meet these clear national needs, it's because we choose not to do so. It will be because, instead, we choose to reward ourselves today by risking our prosperity tomorrow.;I hope Congress will make the right choice. When Members cast their ballots on the Republican tax plan, they're really voting also on whether to save Social Security and Medicare. They're voting on whether to pay off the national debt for the first time in over 150 years, something that would guarantee us lower interest rates, higher investment, more jobs, higher incomes, and for average citizens, lower home mortgage payments, car payments, credit card payments, college loan payments. They're voting whether to meet our most pressing national priorities in education, defense, nearly every other domain in our people's lives. I think the choice is clear between the plan the Republican leadership has outlined and the national priorities of the American people. I hope we can still work together across party lines to save Social Security and Medicare, to safeguard our priorities, and have the right kind of tax cut.;If Congress passes the wrong kind, of course, I will not sign it. I will not allow a risky plan to become law. And as I said, we now have 6 1/2 years of evidence. This is not really a debate that's just about ideas without any evidence. We clearly know what works now, and we ought to stay with it.;As I said, I will work with any member of any party willing to put first things first. We can have a tax cut and do the right thing for the long term in America. That is my commitment, and I hope that together we can fulfill it for our people.;Thank you very much. Helen [Helen Thomas, United Press International].;One China" Policy and Taiwan;Q. Mr. President, in U.S. treaty relations, is it obligated to defend Taiwan militarily if it abandons the "one China" policy? And would the U.S. continue military aid if it continues, if it pursues separatism?;The President. Well, let me say, first of all, a lot of those questions are governed by the Taiwan Relations Act, which we intend to honor. Our policy is clear: We favor the "one China" policy, we favor the cross-strait dialogs. The understanding we have had all along with both China and Taiwan is that the differences between them would be resolved peacefully. If that were not to be the case, under the Taiwan Relations Act, we would be required to view it with the gravest concern.;But I believe that both China and Taiwan understand this. I believe that they want to stay on a path to prosperity and dialog. And we have dispatched people today, as the morning press reports, to do what we can to press that case to all sides. This is something that we don't want to see escalate, and I believe that what Mr. Lee said yesterday was trying to move in that direction. We all understand how difficult this is, but I think that the pillars of the policy are still the right ones. The "one China" policy is right, the cross-strait dialog is right, the peaceful approach is right. And neither side, in my judgment, should depart from any of those elements.;Q. So we would still have to go to war with China if it decided to break away?;The President. I will say what I've already said. The Taiwan Relations Act governs our policy. We made it clear. And I have—as you remember, a few years ago we had a physical expression of that, that we don't believe there should be any violent attempts to resolve this, and we would view it very seriously. But I don't believe there will be. I think that both sides understand what needs to be done.;Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].;Q. Mr. President, do you think that President Lee was unnecessarily provocative in trying to redefine the nature of the Taiwan-Chinese relationship? And is the United States trying to send a signal by delaying a Pentagon mission which was going to Taiwan to assess its air defense needs? And further, finally, you said that you still believe in a "one China" policy. How do you address Senator Helms' criticism that it's a—that that policy is a puzzling fiction?;The President. Well, I don't think it's a puzzling fiction. I think that—but if Senator Helms means that today they're not, in fact, unified, then that's true. But the Chinese tend to take a long view of these things and have made clear a sensitivity to the different system that exists on Taiwan and a willingness to find ways to accommodate it, as they did in working with Hong Kong, and perhaps, even going beyond that.;So I think the important thing is to let— they need to take the time necessary to work this out between themselves in a peaceful way. That is clearly in both their interests. And I'm still not entirely sure, because I have read things which seem to resonate both ways on this, exactly what the Lee statements were entitled— trying to convey.;But I think that both sides are now quite aware of the fact that they need to find a way to pursue their destinies within the framework that we have followed these last several years, which I might add has allowed both places to prosper and to grow, to do better, and to have more contacts, more investment, and underneath the rhetoric, quite a bit more reconciliation. So I would hope that we would stay with what is working and not depart from it.;Q. Is that the meaning of the delay of the Pentagon mission to assess the——;The President. I didn't think this was the best time to do something which might excite either one side or the other and imply that a military solution is an acceptable alternative. If you really think about what's at stake here, it would be unthinkable. And I want—I don't want to depart from any of the three pillars. I think we need to stay with "one China", I think we need to stay with the dialog, and I think that no one should contemplate force here.;Randy [Randy Mikkelsen, Reuters].;Federal Reserve Board Chairman;Q. Economists have been calling on you to indicate now whether you intend to reappoint Alan Greenspan in order to avoid having the issue to become mired in election-year politics and upsetting financial markets next year. Would you like to see the Chairman stay on, and has he given you any indication of his plans?;The President. I have, as you know, enjoyed a very good relationship, both personally and professionally, with Mr. Greenspan. I think he has done a terrific job. I have no idea whether he would even be willing to serve another term. I will make the decision in a timely fashion. I do not expect it to become embroiled in election-year politics, there's no evidence of that.;You heard—I think the Vice President said yesterday or the day before that he thought he was doing an excellent job. So we believe that as long as the United States is fiscally responsible, then the Fed will respond to developments in our own economy and in the world economy in a way that is clear, transparent, and, I think, designed to keep our growth going. So I'm not concerned about it.;Peter [Peter Maer, NBC Mutual Radio], go ahead.;Q. I think the Vice President indicated he was sending a signal by saying that Chairman Greenspan had been doing an excellent job. Do you endorse that interpretation?;The President. I don't know. All I know is he said he was doing a great job, and I agree with him.;Go ahead.;John F. Kennedy, Jr., Aircraft Tragedy/Medicare;Q. Mr. President, you mentioned the Kennedy tragedy at the beginning of the news conference. Could you please give us a better understanding of what the White House role has been in the conduct of the recovery operation and the decisionmaking on the release of information about it?;The President. Well, I think that—I am unaware of any role we have played in the decisionmaking of the release of information, except, let me say that today a lot of things are breaking in a hurry, and I believe there are some decisions that ought to be announced by the Kennedy family and others that ought to be properly announced by either the Coast Guard or the NTSB.;So we have not tried—to the best of my knowledge, had any role in the timing or substance of the release of information. And we have had no role in the conduct of the operation except that I did talk to Admiral Larrabee, I think it was the day before yesterday, at a time when the operation might normally have ceased, and he said, "I think we have a chance to find something else because of the equipment we have here, even though it's difficult, and I'm inclined to believe, because of the circumstances here and because who's involved, that we ought to go on a little more." And I said that I would support it and defend it. And I think it was the right decision.;Q. Mr. President, if you'll allow me to ask you about two different topics. On the Kennedy search, sir, there have been conflicting reports about whether or not Mr. Kennedy's body has, in fact, been recovered. I understand that based upon the answer you just gave, that might not be a question that you'd want to address, but, perhaps, given the fact that there is this conflicting information, you could answer that question.;And secondly, sir, on this notion of a drug benefit, prescription drug benefit, you chided the Republicans about targeting tax cuts at the wealthy, saying that they're too steered in that direction. How do you reconcile that philosophically with allowing rich Americans, rich older Americans, to get a prescription drug benefit which even you just said this new study will show one in four don't need?;The President. Well, first of all, it's voluntary. And most wealthy Americans are well taken care of under the present program they have and won't exercise it. So that's the first point I want to make.;The second thing I would like to say is I don't think most people know this, even some of you may have forgotten, but in the 11th hour of the balanced budget, of the deficit reduction package negotiations in 1993, in order to get up to $500 billion in cuts in the deficit projected over 5 years—we did much better, as all of you know—the cap was taken off. The income cap was taken off of the Medicare tax, which means virtually every single upper income person in America will pay far more into the Medicare program than they will ever draw out in health care or benefits.;They are making a net significant contribution today because, unlike Social Security taxes where there is still an earnings cap, there is no longer an earnings cap on Medicare. And I think a lot of folks have forgotten that. So that in that sense, this is the most progressive program we have. The upper income people, particularly once you get over about $250,000 in income, they're paying far more into this program over the course of their life than they could ever draw out if they were sick every day from the time they're 65 on.;Q. Sir, the question—[ inaudible ]—Mr. Kennedy's body?;The President. I just don't think I should make an announcement about that. I am aware of what the Coast Guard has done and what they have found as of 5 minutes before I came out here. But I simply—I just don't think it's appropriate for me—I'll be glad to comment on whatever they want to say, but I think I should leave it for them to talk.;Yes, go ahead.;Congressional Budget Office Estimates;Q. Sir, you talked about how expensive the Republican tax cuts would be. But the Congressional Budget Office has now just come out with a report saying that even with their tax cuts, almost $800 billion in tax cuts, they would save about $277 billion over a 10-year period, whereby your program would save only about $50 billion, that's about $227 billion difference. How do you reconcile that? And, you know, people on the Hill listen to the CBO.;The President. They listen to the CBO except where it's inconvenient for them, like the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Republicans have freed us all now to question the CBO, since they ignored the CBO in the Patients' Bill of Rights, they have discredited their own CBO.;Let me say, I haven't seen that CBO accounting. All I can tell you is that all of our budget people were rolling their eyes and saying that it was a very creative study.;Let me just say this: You have 6 1/2 years of experience with the numbers we have given you and the estimates we have made. And every single year, our numbers have not only been accurate, but we have done better than we said we would do—every single year, for 6 1/2 years now.;Our studies show that their tax cut over the next two decades will cost, first, a trillion dollars, and then 3 trillion in the second decade, and that—then an enormous loss to the American people in interest savings. That is, we'll have to keep spending more and more of our tax money paying interest on the debt, and it will require huge cuts in education and defense and other things.;You cannot—they simply cannot credibly make that statement. And they don't put any new money into the Medicare program. And they don't have a Medicare reform package out there. So unless they just simply propose to bankrupt all the teaching hospitals and a lot of the other hospitals in the country and let the Medicare program wither away, as one of the previous leaders so eloquently put it, they can't possibly finance this tax program without doing serious damage. I can't comment on the CBO study, but it doesn't make any sense to anybody I've talked to about it.;Q. May I just follow up?;The President. Yes.;Q. The CBO estimates the cost of your Medicare reforms are more than twice what you say they are.;The President. Well, again you have evidence. Let me just say this: In the 1997 balanced budget agreement we agreed to a Medicare savings figure, okay. And this is the reason all these teaching hospitals are in trouble today. We agreed to a Medicare savings figure, and we said, "Okay, here is our health information"— this is what we do in the executive branch, we deal with these hospitals—"here are the changes you need to make in the Medicare program to achieve the savings that the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress and the White House agreed on." And the CBO said, "No, no, no, no, that won't come close, you need these changes plus these changes." And we said, "Okay, we're following the CBO, we put it in there." What happened? And that's one of the reasons the surplus is somewhat bigger than it otherwise would be—the cuts in Medicare were far more severe. Our numbers were right, their numbers were wrong, and that's why you've got all these hospitals all over America, every place I go, talking about how they're threatened with bankruptcy.;So when it comes to estimating Medicare costs, again, we have evidence. And whenever there's been a difference between us and the CBO, we've been right, and they've been wrong. That's all I can tell you. No serious person— so what are they going to do about Medicare? They say our drug program will cost more. They don't put a red cent into it, what are they going to do about it? Even if you don't have a drug program, if you adopt their tax cut program, they won't be able to do anything to extend the solvency of Medicare, and they will have to have huge cuts.;For them to produce those savings, they are going to—they can't even fund my defense budget, much less the one they say they want. They're going to have cuts in defense, cuts in education, cuts in the environment. That's all their savings assumed, that they're going to stay with the present budget levels, which they, themselves, are trying to get out of even as we speak here today. So this is—the American people are not—I mean, this is not rocket science, this is arithmetic.;And we've been dealing with—we went from creative supply-side mathematics to elemental arithmetic in 1993. And it has served us very well. And all I'm trying to do is stick with basic arithmetic and get this country out of debt, save Social Security and Medicare, provide this prescription drug benefit, keep us moving forward.;Q. Mr. President?;The President. Go ahead, John [John King, Cable News Network].;Q. Mr. President?;The President. Next. Let me take John's first, then I'll take you, Sarah [Sarah McClendon, McClendon News Service].;Telephone Conversation With Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestinian Authority;Q. Sir, in your conversation with Chairman Arafat this morning, did you ask him to take any specific steps to advance what you believe is new momentum toward peace, and did you discuss with him his complaints yesterday that he found Prime Minister Barak's 15-month timetable unacceptable?;The President. Well, I told him only this, I said that—I generally described my meetings with Prime Minister Barak to him. I told him that he was committed to working in partnership with Chairman Arafat and honoring any agreements that had been made to this point and that any modifications they made, going forward, to the benefit of either or both sides would have to be done by mutual agreement, that I thought he was completely committed to resolve all the issues outstanding in the peace process in an expeditious manner. And what I urged him to do was to have this one-on-one meeting, hear him out, think it through, and if he wanted to talk to me again after the meeting occurred, that I would be happy to talk to him.;So I went out of my way not to describe Prime Minister Barak's proposals or to advocate or not advocate, but simply to say that I was convinced they were being made in complete good faith and that they would—that the peace process would be revitalized, and whatever they did from here on out is something that they would do together. And I think he felt good about that. And I did say, "After you have the meeting, if you want to talk about this around, I'll be glad to talk to you." And he said he did. So that's where we are.;Sarah. Go ahead, Sarah.;Public Posting of Daily White House Activities;Q. Sir, your microphone is not working apparently, it seems like you're talking very low. We can barely hear you. But in the meantime, don't you think it would be a good idea if we announced for the country's sake the list of conferences to be held at the White House each day, and the list of the people whom the President has appointments with?;The President. I don't know. I never thought about it. Don't you have a list of the conferences we have every day here?;Q. No, indeed. We do—and what if we find out you haven't any?;The President. Well, I think I ought to talk to our folks about it, but I will consider that. Go ahead.;Balkan Summit and Aid to Serbia;Q. Will you be taking any concrete contributions with you to the Balkan summit on investment next week? And you've said that you would give only humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia as long as Milosevic is in power. Will you have any trouble defining that? Will that cause any problems in distinguishing between humanitarian and other aid?;The President. Well, let me say that I hope very much that there will be some positive, concrete commitments that come out of the meeting that we're going to have. I do not believe we can achieve the future we want in the Balkans and avoid future ethnic conflicts unless there is a unifying vision which both brings the Balkan States closer together in their economic and political self-interests and then brings the region as a whole closer to Europe.;And so I think that we have to have some incentives to move in that direction. And there are direct—there are also indirect things the United States can do to help to contribute to that goal. And because of all the other things that have been going on—you know it's been a very busy 2 or 3 weeks—we haven't actually had an opportunity to sit down and go through what our options are, so I can't give you a more specific answer.;But I will say this: If what we have done in Bosnia and what we have done in Kosovo is to have lasting benefits, we have got to find a way to create closer unity among the Balkan States themselves, and then with the region and Europe. And that is what I am working on.;And what was the second question you asked?;Q. On the humanitarian aid, how will you define it?;The President. Oh, yes. There may be—frankly, there may be some differences of opinion. As you know, I tend to take a rather narrow view of it because I don't think that we should, in effect, reward Mr. Milosevic's political control by doing things which are not humanitarian in nature. But based on the virtual daily reports I get about where we all are on this and where we are operating in Kosovo, I now no longer expect them to be big debates. I don't expect there will be a big difference of opinion.;Yes, go ahead, John [John M. Broder, New York Times].;F-22 Funding;Q. Mr. President, the House of Representatives appears to be on the verge of terminating funding for the F-22 fighter. Will the White House fight hard for full funding for that program, even if it means sacrificing other Pentagon airplane programs or even pay for servicemen?;The President. Well, I don't think we should sacrifice the pay for our service personnel because we now are getting back in the ballgame in recruitment. You know, we've really been— the good economy and the increased deployments and the low pay, all combined, it'd be making it hard for us to both recruit and retain people. And the people are still the most important part of our military, their quality and their training and their morale and their commitment and the condition of their families. So I don't think that.;Now, the Congress every year puts other things into the defense budget which are not priorities for the Pentagon and are priorities for the Congress. We can fund the F-22, we can fund the plane without compromising the basic priorities of our national defense within the funds set aside, and that is what I will fight to do. I think it would be a mistake to abandon the project. I think it has real potential to add to our national defense. I have always supported it, and I hope that it can be preserved.;2000 Elections;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You had some fun, recently, with George W. Bush and his slogan of "compassionate conservatism." But you went beyond the notion that he's not offering many details as policy and seemed to ridicule his slogan and even question his sincerity. Were you just trying to help Mr. Gore's candidacy, or were you taking the opportunity maybe to just needle the leading Republican candidate?;The President. No, I was just having a little fun. [ Laughter ] You know, this is such a long time, if we don't have any laughs, it's going to be a very tedious struggle between now and November of 2000.;Let me say this. I think that every person struggles to find a phrase or something that will sort of stand for what he or she is trying to do. So I was really just having a little fun.;I think the most important thing is that all the candidates make their positions clear on the great debates going on now, and make their positions clear on what they would do if they got the job. To me, that's the most important thing. You know, I am not involved in this campaign as a candidate, and I have a full-time job, so I'm not involved in any sort of fulltime consulting role. [ Laughter ] So I look at this more from the point of view of the average American voter: What will change the lives of America?;For example, every candidate should tell us, are you for the Patients' Bill of Rights, are you for closing the gun show loophole, are you for raising the minimum wage, are you for the House Republican tax plan, or do you favor our plan on Social Security and saving Social Security and Medicare, making America debtfree, and having a smaller tax cut that enables us to continue to fund education and defense and these other things? What are you going to do if you get elected?;To me, the best thing the Vice President had done is to talk about dramatically intensifying the war on cancer, making preschool universal, increasing access to college by helping people save without tax consequences, what he could do to make America a safer country, what he would do in communities to have faith-based organizations cooperate with governments more. I think these are interesting ideas about how you build on the progress the country has made the last 6 1/2 years.;So I would say to everyone, use whatever slogans you want, but tell us where you stand. I think that's the most important thing.;Susan [Susan Page, USA Today].;Q. Mr. President——;The President. Yes, I'll come over here. I know I'm left-leaning, but I will give you— [ laughter ].;Q. Mr. President, the economy is going great. In a new USA Today-CNN poll this week, your approval rating was at a very healthy 58 percent. But that same poll showed that by 50 percent to 38 percent, Americans said they wanted to see a change from Clinton administration policies, not a continuation of them. What do you think accounts for that sentiment for change, and do you think it means that you present something of a mixed blessing to Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Gore in their campaigns next year?;The President. I think what that means is people think things are going well, but they want a change in policy. I think that's right. If you asked me that question, and you worded it in that way, I'd be in the 50 percent, because I think that—my own view is that in a—particularly in a dynamic time, where things are changing, you should want continued change. But is change—the question is, should we change in a way that builds on what has been done and goes beyond it, which is what I would argue, or should you change and go back to the policies we were following when we had $290 billion deficits and we averaged over 7 percent unemployment for 12 years? I mean, I think that's really the question the American people have to ask themselves.;I think change is good. The great thing about this country is that it works best when it's sort of in a perpetual stage of renewal. So I would, myself, as a citizen, I would vote against somebody who said, "Vote for me, and I'll keep it just like it is, everything that Bill Clinton did is exactly what I'll do." I would vote against that candidate, because I do not believe that is the right thing to do.;But what I think we should do is we should build on the progress of the last 6 years and go beyond it and not adopt a completely different approach which has been proven not to work. So all I want the American people to do is to remember what it was like before, think what it's like now, recognize that ideas and policies have consequences. And the American people usually get it right, that's why we're all still around here after more than 200 years.;Q. [ Inaudible ];The President. No.;Q. [ Inaudible ]—for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore?;The President. No, because I—he has done— look at what the Vice President's done. He's staked out new issues here. He said, "Here's how I'm going to change what we're doing in cancer research, here's how I'm going to change what we're doing in education, here's how I'm going to change what we're doing in crime"— but not to reverse what we've done, but to build on it and go beyond it. So I think that's very, very—that's the sort of thing that's worthy of debate. That's not the same, that is change.;What the American people have to decide is what kind of change do they want. Do they want to build on what has worked for the last 6 1/2 years, or do they want to abandon it and go back to what failed them for 12 years before? That will be the decision they have to make.;Yes, go ahead.;Syria-U.S. Relations/Iran;Q. In your last press conference, sir, with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, you mentioned you wanted better, normalized relations with Syria. Now, have you received any response, positive response or indication from Syria towards that? And on Iran, can you share with us the administration's views of the last events and administrations in Iran? Thank you.;The President. Well, on Syria let me say, the only thing I can tell you is that the statements, at least, that have been coming out of Syria have been quite encouraging in terms of the regard that President Asad seems to have for Prime Minister Barak, and the willingness, the openness that there is to negotiating and moving toward peace. So I'm encouraged by that.;And on Iran, frankly, I'm reluctant to say anything for fear that it will be used in a way that's not helpful to the forces of openness and reform. I think that people everywhere, particularly younger people, hope that they will be able to pursue their religious convictions and their personal dreams in an atmosphere of greater freedom that still allows them to be deeply loyal to their nation. And I think the Iranian people obviously love their country and are proud of its history and have enormous potential. And I just hope they find a way to work through all this, and I believe they will.;Health Insurance;Q. You mentioned the Patients' Bill of Rights. It seems like that was an argument by both parties over providing more for people who already are lucky enough to have health insurance. And in fact, neither party dealt with some very fundamental issues that energized you and the First Lady 5 and 6 years ago. The question is, with such a robust economy and the budget surpluses, if not now, when, and if not you, who, would provide the leadership to provide for those folks?;The President. Yes, but I think the bigger question is how. That is, it is true that just as we've predicted in 1993 and 1994, that the percentage of people who have health insurance on the job is going down, just as we said it would, if nothing was done. So what we have tried to do is to isolate discrete populations that seem to be most in need and try to offer them help.;In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we reached bipartisan agreement on a proposal that would fund providing health insurance for up to 5 million more children through State-designed programs. Now, I've been a little disappointed—and I'm not being critical of any of the States, either, here—but I've been a little disappointed that the uptake on the program has been a little slow. That is, I would have thought by now we'd have almost 3 million of those 5 million children enrolled already because we've got the money there, and we're well behind that.;So we are looking at whether there are things that we can do at the national level to work with the States to simplify access to the children's health insurance programs that the States have set up. And I also had a talk with Senator Kennedy the other day, who believes that for little or no more extra money, we could actually adjust the program and take in several million more children. So the children are the biggest group.;Then, I have a proposal, as you know, that's part of my Medicare reform proposal that I didn't mention today, but I want to reiterate it, that would allow the most vulnerable group of people without health insurance, people between the ages of 55 and 65, to buy into the Medicare system in a way that would not compromise the integrity of the system. So I think that is quite important.;In addition to that, there are a lot of States— excuse me, there are some States—Tennessee was the first State to do this under the former Governor, Mr. McWherter, they started it— which are allowing lower income working families to buy into their Medicaid programs on a sliding scale.;So if all these things were done, we would dramatically reduce the number of people without health insurance, and we'll eventually, probably, get down to—if we keep pushing in this direction, get down to the point where the largest group of people without health insurance are young, single people who believe that they're going to live forever and be healthy forever and don't want to bear the cost. And we'll have to think about, then, what to do.;But I think the best thing to do is try to get as many kids as we can covered and then try to get these people who are out of the work force who are older, but they're not old enough to get Medicare, to get them at least where they can all afford, on a sliding scale, to buy into the Medicare program.;Go ahead, Scott [Scott Pelley, CBS News].;John F. Kennedy, Jr., Aircraft Tragedy;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On the Kennedy tragedy, sir, will you authorize the Navy to participate in a burial at sea ceremony? Why do you believe it's justified to spend so many Federal resources on this tragedy? And finally, sir, I wonder if you would give us your thoughts on Mr. Kennedy's last visit here to the White House. I understand you and the First Lady took him on a tour.;The President. Well, we have received—I have received no official word, personal word from the family about what burial arrangements they want. Until they make a statement about it, I just don't feel that I can say anything.;Secondly, I will say that until just a couple of days ago the recovery efforts—the rescue, then the recovery efforts that were undertaken, were consistent with what would have been done in any other case. Because the Coast Guard felt that they had the capacity to succeed in this if they had a few more days, and because of the role of the Kennedy family in our national lives, and because of the enormous losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes, I thought it was appropriate to give them a few more days. And if anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at fault, I am. It was because I thought it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.;Now, you asked about—John Kennedy had actually not been back to the White House since his father was killed, until I became President. First, he was on an advisory committee that made a report to me, and he came back to the Oval Office, where he saw the desk that he took the famous picture in—coming through the gate—for the first time since he was a little boy.;And then last year, maybe you would have a better memory than I would, but it seems to me it was last May, when we had the event at the White House celebrating the series that HBO did on the Apollo program. Do you remember they did a series on the space program that was done after the movie came out? And Tom Hanks came, a lot of people came. And he was invited because of his father's role in starting the space program. And he and Carolyn came. And afterward I asked them if they would like to go upstairs, and he said he would. So I took him upstairs and showed him the residence, which he'd not seen since he was a tiny boy.;And I showed him some of my—the memorabilia that I had from his father's service. I have a picture of his father speaking to the Irish Parliament, and a number of other things which he thought were very interesting. And we took a—we had a very nice evening. And I sent him the pictures from it. And then, in return, he sent me a signed copy of his favorite picture of his father, which is now upstairs. It's John Kennedy campaigning in Virginia, in Charlottesville, in 1960. It's quite a lovely picture, interesting picture.;But it was a nice night. I think that he really wanted to kind of come to terms with all of it. And I think he and Carolyn, they were delightful young people, and they had a great time here that night. And Hillary and I loved having them here. It was quite a great night.;Q. To just follow on that, sir, just one question, if I may. Is there anything that Mr. Kennedy said to you that night that particularly struck you?;The President. We just had a friendly conversation. You know, I knew him pretty well by then. We'd been—I met him years ago when he was a law student, doing a summer internship with Mickey Kantor's law firm out in Los Angeles, long before I ever thought I'd be here, and before I ever thought we'd have any other contacts. He just happened to be—Mickey asked me if I'd speak to his law clerks, because I was in L.A. to give an education speech, and I went by and visited with them, and he was there. And we had been together on many occasions since then.;The thing that struck me was I thought he was—he said he was glad to be back. And I think he was a very deliberate person, as many people have noticed, about when he would be publicly exposed and all of that. He had his mother's care for having a private life. And I think that he had not—I'm not sure he had really felt he wanted to come back to the White House before he did. But especially in light of everything that's happened, I'm glad he had the chance to come back here one more time and see the residence and know where he was when he was a little boy. I'm glad he did that. I'm grateful that that happened.;Yes, go ahead. Yes, yes, please.;Colombia and Mexico;Q. On Colombia, the Pastrana administration are asking the United States for $500 million to support the military against the guerrillas. Is your administration ready to respond to that request? And also, the Colombians are asking for more direct intervention from the United States. Are you considering this possibility? And also, Mexico, you're going to meet with President Zedillo in October. And the Mexican Government is still rejecting the extraditions of major drug lords. What are you going to ask him? You're going to get assurance from him to extradite these big narcotic traffickers to the United States?;The President. Well, you know, we had no extraditions between Mexico and the United States for a long time, and we've actually had some now. So we've moving in the right direction. And President Zedillo and I have been pretty successful in continuing to move our relationship in the right direction, so we'll work on that.;On Colombia, I'm not prepared to make any kind of dollar commitment today. But let me say, I have stayed in close touch with President Pastrana, and I admire the fact that he has really thrown himself into trying to end the civil conflicts in Colombia, to stop the insurgency. The people in the United States have a real interest in that because I think that until the civil discord in Colombia is brought to an end, it is going to be much, much harder for us to restrain the activities of the narcotraffickers there, and their reach.;So, in addition to wanting a neighbor and a democracy in Latin America to be free of the kind of violence and heartbreak that the Colombian people have undergone because of this, it is also very much in our national security interest to do what we can, if we can be helpful in ending the civil conflict, so that Colombia can be about the business of freeing itself of the influence of the narcotraffickers in ways that would be good for Colombians and good for us as well.;2000 Election;Q. Another question about the Presidential race. Aside from asking George W. Bush to come forward and give specifics on the issues that you mentioned, could you tell us what you find objectionable about this trying to present a new moderate face for his party, just like you did for the Democrats? And could you tell us whether you're worried whether he will figure out how the Republicans can occupy the center of American politics?;The President. No.;Q. You don't think he can?;The President. No, no. I don't think I'll answer those questions. [ Laughter ] I will say— no, look, let me say again, I wouldn't even agree with the characterization you gave of my first answer.;When I ran for President in 1991, the first thing I did was tell the American people what I thought was going on in our country and what I would do. And if you remember, the late Senator Paul Tsongas and I were actually almost ridiculed at the time because we both put out these very detailed plans of what we would do. If you go back and get one of those plans now, you'll see that virtually everything we said we'd do, we did do, except for the things we tried to do and were defeated on.;And my view is that there are a lot of things that count in a Presidential election toward a successful Presidency, but it is—that go beyond specific issues, and judgment plays a role in it, and crises will always come up, and things can be learned and all that. But it really matters where you stand on the big issues that everybody knows about that are going on right now, and it matters where we're going in the future.;So that's the only point I want to make. And I think any—I would say that applies to every candidate. I don't want to answer the questions you ask me, because that's not my job. My job is not to handicap this horse race, not to comment on it, not to comment on the candidates. My job is to work for the American people. But I'm going to answer these questions from the point of view of Joe Citizen. That's it. Every political question you ask me from now on, I'm going to pretend that I'm living back in Little Rock already and I'm working on my Presidential library and I'm sitting here as a voter saying, where do they stand, what will they do, all of them? And I do believe the Vice President has done the best job of telling the American people what he would do and—to go back to Susan's formulation—how he would change the country in a positive way.;George [George Condon, Copley News Service].;Space Program;Q. Mr. President, as the Nation has celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Moon landing, a lot of the former astronauts have lamented that no President after Kennedy set a kind of national goal like President Kennedy did of landing on the Moon. Do you think that, in your view, is the country not receptive today to that kind of goal-setting by a President, or is it something a President should do, set a goal of landing on Mars?;The President. Well, we are planning to land on Mars. But I think that for one thing, when I became President, the space program was actually in peril. And we—the space station was certainly at risk. And I have fought for it, and I believe in it. And one of the things I talked to—Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were in to see me yesterday, and we talked about where we could go with this. And Dan Goldin was there, the NASA Administrator, and Dr. Neal Lane, my science adviser, and we talked about how we could use the coming of the millennium as—you know, the First Lady sponsored all these other lectures here. And I told him about Stephen Hawking's lecture and what he said. And we talked yesterday about how we could set some goals for the space program, capture the imagination of the American people, and broaden the support for it.;And one of the things that I suggested, that I think would be quite helpful, that we're going to work on now, is what we can do to dramatize for the American people—you mentioned Mars, but I think what is more likely to capture the imagination of the American people are the benefits to us here on Earth of continued advances in space. And some of them, particularly in the health field, are likely to be breathtaking. They're principally in the area of the environment and health.;So I asked our people to start working on that, and they said they would be willing to help us. I have to tell you that it was a great day for me yesterday to have them come by the White House. They also gave me a Moon rock, by the way, but only on loan. [ Laughter ] And the Moon rock is 3.6 billion years old. So when I feel very tired, I'll look at it and feel young again. [ Laughter ];Yes, go ahead. We had an Irish question first, I promised. Go ahead, what's the Irish question?;Q. Thank you, sir. Given the——;The President. You want to ask one, too?;Northern Ireland Peace Process/Africa;Q. We both have a—given the various meetings underway with Mo Mowlam here, and George Mitchell there, has any progress been made on the Irish situation? And is one side more to blame than the other on it?;The President. Okay. Why don't we take both Irish questions at once. What's your Irish question?;Q. Last week you seemed to kind of get fired up when you were talking to the teenagers from Colorado. You said that the politicians in Northern Ireland were behaving akin to school children. Do you feel, after all the work that you've done on this project, that perhaps it was misplaced, and you should have perhaps pushed in a place more like Africa, where they have thousands of people dying from ethnic strife, instead of 3,500 over 30 years?;Q. And if I can have a third Irish question, what role, if any, do you expect to play, Mr. President, in breaking the deadlock?;The President. Okay, let me answer the Irish questions, then I'll come back to the "Should we have done something else?;I've talked to Senator Mitchell, and he is willing to spend some time—he can't go back fulltime for another year or 2, but I'd like to put this in some—at least I'd like to tell you how I look at it.;Obviously, I am very disappointed at the breakdown of the process here. But I do think it's important to note that neither side wants to abandon the Good Friday agreement. And that's very important. It's also important to note that everybody agrees on what their responsibilities are and what the other side's responsibilities are, and everybody agrees that it all has to be done by a date certain.;So they have agreed to break out the two areas causing problems, the decommissioning and the standing up to the executive, and try to figure out how they can unlock that. And Mo Mowlam, as you pointed out, is working hard on it, and they've asked Senator Mitchell to come back and do some work on it, and my instinct is that it will be resolved.;Now, let me say in terms of your characterization, here's the problem. To the outsiders—I told the parties that to the outsiders—no one, none of us outside, even somebody like me that's been so involved in this, no one will understand if this thing breaks down over who goes first, that that did sound like the kind of argument that young people have, you know. Who goes first?;Underneath that, there's something deeper. The Protestants are afraid that the IRA will never disarm if they let the Sinn Fein go into the executive branch, and the IRA do not believe, since the agreement did not require decommissioning as a condition of getting into the executive branch, they don't want to have to spend the rest of their lives being told that it wasn't the vote of the people, it wasn't the Good Friday accord, it was what the Unionists and Great Britain did to force them to give up their arms that got them to disarm. They believe that would, in effect, require them to disavow what they've done for 30 years.;And what they're saying is, "When we surrender our arms, we're surrendering to our people. Our people voted for this. We are surrendering to the will of the people that we represent." So when you put it in that textured way on both sides, it makes it clear why it becomes a difficult issue. And I can't think of anybody better to try to work through it than George Mitchell, because he's got it all in his head, and he's put 3 years into it. But my instinct is that we will get this worked out.;Now, you asked about did I think we had misplaced our energies. I don't think so. We have—for one thing, we don't have a stronger partner in the world than Great Britain, and for another, we don't have a bigger ethnic group in America than the Irish, and we're tied by blood and emotion to the Irish struggle. I also think that it has enormous symbolism, beyond the size of the country and the number who have died. And if it can be resolved, I think it will give great impetus to the forces of peace throughout the world. So I don't believe for a moment we made a mistake.;But let me also say I think we should be more involved in Africa, and I've tried to involve us more in Africa. I did everything I could to head off that civil war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. It's not a civil war, they are two separate countries, but they once were together and they're basically now arguing over the divorce settlement. And I don't mean to trivialize it in that characterization. And we are still actively involved in trying to stop that.;Reverend Jackson played a significant role in trying to end the awful carnage in Sierra Leone, and I'm very grateful for that. We're now working, and we're able to work with Nigeria to try to stabilize the region. We are training African militaries and the Africa Crisis Response Corps, so that we can, hopefully, prevent further carnage. So I believe the United States should be more involved in Africa.;And of course, the announcement that the Vice President made on our behalf the other day of our new AIDS initiative in some ways may be the most important thing we can do to save lives there.;So I agree that we should be more involved. But I don't agree that we misplaced our energies in Ireland. I'm proud of every late night phone call and every frustrating hour I've spent on it.;Yes, go ahead.;Q. Can I ask about you?;The President. Well, I don't want to talk about me.;Q. Oh, come on.;The President. I'm not a candidate for anything.;Go ahead, what? Go ahead. All right, one more.;White House Bicentennial;Q. Listen Mr. President, with due respect, in another development, I know that you are for Africa, and you know that I support the initiative of Africa, now, of my friend the President of the Dominican Republic because we are Afro-Latino. But I am not concerned at this moment about Mars. I am concerned about a place where I have been for 20 years, the White House, that is going to celebrate 200 years next year. I wonder if you would tell the people of the United States what you are going to plan for that big celebration?;And another thing, Mr. President, I am disgusted with you. You have been hiding something extraordinary, the performance of the trade promotional coordinating committee, that has been carrying out in the last year a national exporting strategy, are the participants in the prospective of this economy. Why don't you speak about the success of that initiative? It's a sin that you—[ inaudible ]—you talk about a lot of things that is nothing, another thing that is good for America and the prosperity of the world.;The President. Well, a lot of things that are good for America don't make good news for them, you see.;Q. And I have a followup. [ Laughter ];The President. No, let me just say—[ laughter ]—a followup? [ Laughter ] Now, that's really good. That is really—oh, God, is that good.;Let me just say that we will have a lot of celebrations of the 200th birthday of the White House next year, and it's neat that it coincides with the first year of the new century and the millennium. So we'll have—I'm not prepared to announce them yet, because I want others who deserve more credit than I do to be able to do that. But it will be a signal honor for us to be living here in that year, and we'll be able to do a lot. And I hope we'll have even more American citizens coming to the White House next year to be a part of it.;Go ahead. Just that followup—that showed a lot of guts. [ Laughter ] If this is a followup, I'll give you another question. [ Laughter ];Support for Vice President Gore and First Lady;Q. Sir, you've stressed that you have plenty to do, and yet for some time, your political career has enjoyed the benefits of support from two people in particular—the Vice President and the First Lady—two people who are now in a position to expect some support from you. I'm wondering what you feel you owe those two people in terms of political support, and as you plan your schedule in the weeks and months ahead, how you'll balance that assistance against your job as President, and finally, how you personally are adjusting to what people might think is an interesting shift in role.;Q. I have a followup to his question. [ Laughter ];The President. Now, I believe that. [ Laughter ];Well, I will do whatever I'm asked to do, basically. I'll try to be helpful. And if I can be helpful, I will be. But I think the best thing I can do for anyone who generally shares our ideas, is part of our party, trying to move the country forward, is to continue to be a good President and take care of our country.;But I don't mind hard work, and I don't mind long hours, and I find myself, apparently unlike some of my predecessors—but I just read what you all say about it—but I don't feel myself winding down, I feel myself keying up. I want to do more. I want to try to make sure that I give the American people as much as I can every day. So I've got plenty of energy, and I'll do whatever I'm asked to do.;I owe them a great deal. I think Al Gore— everybody in this room knows that he's had far more responsibility and gotten more done that any Vice President in history. Nobody's ever had a role that even approximates that. I don't think the American people know that yet, but I know that. And he deserves a lot of credit for what he's done, and he has my friendship and my support. But I also think that it's a mixed blessing, as you say, because people want to see any Vice President out there on his own. If you go back and look at where Richard Nixon was in 1959, you will see the same sort of thing. So I think I see this as a rhythmic process. I think he'll do fine.;But the reason I think that has nothing to do with the questions you ask me. The reasons I think that are, A, he's a good man with a good record, but most importantly, he's out there telling the American people how he would change the country for the better. And I think that's important.;I did an interview, and I talked about Hillary and this, if she decides to do this, I will do whatever I can do. And if she's successful, I will happily go to the Senate spouses meeting if that's part of the job. I have never known anybody who didn't run for office who was a more effective, more consistently committed, completely passionate public citizen than her. So if she decides to do it, and if the people of New York decide that they want her to do it, that's a decision for them to make, and they have to deal with that. And she's trying to deal with that, you know, the whole question of moving there.;It is true that shortly after we came here I said, "You get to decide where we live from now on for the rest of our lives." And she said, "I want to go to New York"—in, like '93. This is just something that happened later. So I'll be dividing my time between home—I'm going to be home and build my library and build my center—I'll divide my time between there and New York, whatever she does about this Senate race.;But if I can help her in any way, I will, because I think it would be a great thing for the country, not only because of what I owe her—she just—what she knows and how she's lived and what she's done. I mean, it's very unusual to find somebody like that who has that much knowledge and background and passion all packed into one place. I mean, I know that you think I'm a biased observer, but I think I could support it with evidence.;Q. Mr. President——;The President. Go ahead, Bill [Bill Plante, CBS News].;President's Future Plans;Q. In that same vein, sir—[ laughter ]—as the spotlight shifts from you to your Vice President and to your wife, are you likely to be content drifting slowly offstage, or do you think that someday you will want to run for office, some office again? Or are you willing to tell us this afternoon, sir, that you will never again run for elective office?;The President. I don't have any idea. [ Laughter ] Really, I don't know. Let me just say this. I love this job. I love it. Even on the bad days you can do something good for the country, you can do something good for the future. I have loved doing this. And I have given it every ounce of my energy and ability and judgment. And I feel very fortunate. But we have a system that I, frankly, agree with, even though I'm in pretty good shape. We have a system that says a President gets two terms, and then the President has to go find something else to do with his life. And there are lots of other worthy things to do.;And I was a very happy person before I became President. I've never had any trouble finding something interesting to do that I believed in. And I will do my best to use the opportunity and the gift the American people gave me to serve in this position to be a useful citizen of my country and the world for the rest of my life, and I have no doubt that there will be some way I can do that. And I'm, frankly, kind of excited about it. I mean, it's a new challenge. I'll have to think in a different way and do a different way.;Will I miss a lot of the things about this job? Yes. I'll even miss all of you, believe it or not. [ Laughter ] But I'm just grateful that I've had the chance to serve and that the results have been good for our people and for our country and, I think, for the world.;And you know, that's part of life. Life has its rhythms. And the people that are most satisfied and most happy in life take the rhythms of life and make the most of them, instead of sitting around moping and wishing the rhythms were something other than they are. That's just not the way the life works. And listen, I'm way ahead, and I'm very grateful.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks at the Eighth Millennium Evening at the White House</td><td class="c6">October 12, 1999</td><td class="c7">[ The First Lady began the program making brief remarks and introducing the evening's featured speakers: Dr. Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice president of Internet architecture and technology, MCI WorldCom, who discussed the evolution of Internet technology, and Dr. Eric Lander, director, Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research, who discussed advances in genetic research and biotechnology. ];The President. We have had many wonderful nights here, but I don't think I've ever been more stimulated by two talks in my life. Thank you, Dr. Cerf. Thank you, Dr. Lander.;I would like to also say a word of appreciation to Hillary. I think that, as our time here draws toward its close, it's clear that she has been I believe the most active and innovative First Lady since Eleanor Roosevelt, for perhaps these Millennium Evenings will last longer in the imagination of America than virtually anything any of us have done, and I thank her for that.;Also, being term-limited does have its compensations. Normally, at this time of year, in this kind of year, I'd be doing something else tonight. [ Laughter ] Yesterday I called the Vice President to rub it in and describe what I would be doing tonight. [ Laughter ] And I was having a very good time turning the screw about how fascinating this was going to be. And finally, he said, "That's okay, you need to be there more than I do." [ Laughter ] The jokes about my technological and scientific limitations are legion around the White House. [ Laughter ];So I have been thinking of all these questions. Do I really want a mouse smart enough to go to Princeton? [ Laughter ] Won't it be sad to have an Internet connection with Mars if there are no Martians to write to or E-mail us? [ Laughter ] I am glad to know that the total connection of the Internet to the nervous system of human beings is a little ways out there in the future. I had been under the impression that that has already occurred among all children under 15 in America. [ Laughter ];This is an amazing set of topics. Let me say just one other thing. I really loved seeing— on a slightly sad note, I loved seeing that wonderful, famous picture of Wilt Chamberlain and Willie Shoemaker. Some of you may know the great Wilt Chamberlain passed away today, one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century. So I hope you will have him and his family and friends in your thoughts and prayers tonight.;This is a fitting thing for us to do in the White House, because innovations in communication and technology are a very important part of the history of this old place. In 1858 the first transatlantic telegraph transmission was received here in a message that Queen Victoria sent to President Buchanan. Later, the first telephone in Washington, DC, was located in a room upstairs, and we now have a replica of that telephone in the same room upstairs. The first mobile phone call to the Moon was made here by President Nixon 30 years ago. Even these Millennium Evenings have made their own history. This is where we held the firstever cybercast at the White House.;So I want to thank the speakers for building on all of this and telling us what we can look forward to in the future and for reminding us that as we unlock age-old mysteries and make what we can think more possible to do, there are ways to do it that bring us together as a society.;So I would like to begin the questioning, if I might, with a question to Dr. Lander, because it bears on a great deal of the work we've done.;You talked about how we were 99.9 percent the same, but how if you looked at how many permutations there were in the one-tenth of a percent left, we could still be very different. I think it's very interesting—and I talk about this all the time—that as we're on the edge of this new millennium and we have these evenings and we imagine this future that you have sketched out to us, this is what we all like to think about, how exciting, how wonderful, how unbelievable it can be. The biggest threat to that future is how many of us on this globe are still in the grip of the most primitive of human limitations, the fear of the other, people who are different from us. And we see all over the world, from Bosnia and Kosovo to the Middle East to Northern Ireland to the tribal wars in Africa, how easily the focus on our differences—that one-tenth of one percent—as what matters can lead first to fear and then to hatred and then ultimately to dehumanizing people who are different.;And it's very interesting, as someone who grew up in the segregated South and lived with the whole terrible and yet beautiful struggle of the civil rights years, to think that there were in my hometown people who were dehumanizing other people because of the one-tenth of one percent difference between them is quite an awesome thing to contemplate.;So I would like to ask you, if you could say in ways that would make sense to us, explain to us a little bit what is it that makes us the same and what is it that makes us different? And how could we communicate this scientific knowledge to people in a way that would diminish the force of racism and other bigotry in the world in which we live?;[ Dr. Lander responded to the President's question. Then, White House Millennium Council Director Ellen Lovell led the question-and-answer portion of the evening. One of the questions concerned the legal status of privacy rights. ];The President. Let me just say this. We've been working on this, and it's very important to me because I'm a fanatic about this issue. I want unlimited scientific discovery, and I want unlimited applications. But I think we don't want people to lose their sense of self and the fragility of their personhood, here, in some sort of assault. So we've been working on this.;What you said sounds great, but it's not as easy to do as it sounds. So I think it might be helpful, if I could just ask Secretary Shalala, who is in charge of one piece of this, which is our efforts to protect the privacy of medical records, just to talk a little bit in practical terms about what we're doing to respond to this young man's question.;Donna, would you? There's a mike.;[ Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna E. Shalala noted the relative lack of Federal protection of an individual's health information, citing that video rental records were more secure. She also noted that a person's State of residence could make a difference. ];The President. But let's deal with two hard questions here, real quick. I think this is important. Question number one, pretty soon if the genome project is brought to fruition, according to what Dr. Varmus told me, when I spent a day out there, it will become normal in some point in the not-too-distant future for young mothers to go home with their babies from the hospital with a map of their genetic future. You may not want to know about Alzheimer's, but you could know about things that even if you can't cure you could delay, defer, or minimize. So you get that.;Now, the mother and the father are employed by someone, and they provide family health insurance. Since private insurance is based on a reasonable approximation of risk—I don't agree with the way we finance health care in this country. You all know that, but that's a fight I didn't win here in the last 7 years. If it's based on an assessment of risk, what should the insurance company have a right to know? And if the insurance company doesn't have a right to know, haven't you undermined the whole basis of privately funded insurance based on risk—question one. Question two for you.;Dr. Cerf. We don't get to answer that one?;The President. Yes, I want you to answer that, but I want you guys to talk. Question two, this is the problem we face in a much more grave sense in dealing with the prospect of cyberterrorism or something. It's one thing for us to write laws that protect privacy of records. But you just got through—in answering Omar's question, you were talking about how, well, but all these kids are always figuring out, well— among the things they're figuring out is how to break into various systems all the time. So even if we had perfect laws, how are we going to protect privacy when we're dealing with all of these creative geniuses out there working through the net? Respond to those two questions.;[ Dr. Lander replied that insurance companies' right to know depended on whether insurance was about matching rates to risks or about sharing risks not chosen. The question-and-answer portion of the evening continued and included a question from the Internet by Danella Bryce in Sydney, Australia, about technology's effect on alleviation of growing numbers of the disadvantaged in world population. ];The President. Can I give—you said that we got 6 billion people last night. Half of them live on $2 a day, 1.3 billion live on $1 a day or less. Those are the numbers behind what Ms. Bryce is asking.;[ The discussion continued. ];The President. If I might just interject. I don't know the answer to this, but I've spent a lot of time thinking about it. This woman, Ms. Bryce, she works, and she's talked about she works in sustainable development. A big problem in poor countries, they totally destroy the environment to try to develop, and then they don't have anything upon which to develop. The biggest problem in our hemisphere is Haiti. If you fly over the island of Hispaniola, you know when you're going from the Dominican Republic to Haiti, because in all the years when it was governed by dictatorships, they just tore down all the trees and—if any of you know anything about it, know this.;The real question is—we used to have certain assumptions about development in a poor country: that if you wanted ever to build a middle class life for a substantial number of the people, yet have X amount of electric generating capacity, you had to have Y number of roads, and you had to have Z number of manufacturing companies, no matter what they did to greenhouse gases, and that eventually you get around to building schools and universal education, and then 30 or 40 years later you start letting the girls go to school with the boys and there is this sort of thing that would happen.;I do believe that the question, the real question is if you're running a country like this, should you put this sort of infrastructure development first? That is assuming you've got a base level of electricity necessary to run a system. Should you do this first because this gives you the possibility to skip a whole generation of development that would otherwise take 30 years in the economy and in education? And I think the answer to that, at least, is, maybe—at least, is, maybe. That I think is really the question that this woman is asking.;[ The discussion continued. ];The President. If I could just give you one example, because I think this may have also relevance for remote, physically remote areas in America, Appalachia, the Native American reservations, things of this kind.;We were talking before we came in here tonight. I was out in northern California the weekend before last. And I was talking with a lot of people who work for eBay, and they were telling me that there are now, in addition to the employees of eBay, over 20,000 people who make a living on eBay, buying and selling and trading, and that a fair number of these people were actually people who once were on welfare, who moved from welfare to work. That is, from—and presumably a lot of them work, didn't have a lot of formal education. They had made this jump, and a market had been created for them, where they lived, that otherwise would be alien to their own experience. They wouldn't have been able to go down to the bank and get a loan and on and on and on.;Now, last year we made and this year we will make, through our aid programs in foreign countries over 2 million microenterprise loans to poor people, to help them start their businesses in Africa and Latin America and Asia. If you could somehow marry the microenterprise concept to setting the infrastructure of the Internet out there, I do think it's quite possible that you could skip a generation in economic development in a way that would reinforce rather than undermine the environment.;[ The question-and-answer portion of the evening continued. ];The President. Did you say you expected the penetration of the Internet to equal that of the telephone by 2006?;[ Dr. Cerf confirmed the Internet would equal the size of the telephone system by 2006 and, thereafter, exceed both telephone and television. ];The President. I want to get to the genes, but I think we should answer that question, too. The whole question of whether we're going to develop a digital divide in our country, I think, is a very, very serious one. Our administration, especially the Vice President, when we rewrote the Telecommunications Act, we fought very hard not only to get people to participate in NetDay to hookup every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000—I think we'll get there by the end of the year, functionally, we'll be just about there—but also, to get the Federal Communications Commission to adopt an E-rate which would subsidize the cost to poor schools and poorer hospitals and poor areas and isolated rural areas, so that everyone could have access in the schools.;Now, but the divide won't be bridged until the parents of those children have that in their home. So I think we ought to have as a goal at least to make access to computer technology and to the Internet as universal as telephone access is. And I think until we achieve that, there will be a digital divide, so we ought to try to hasten that day and promote whatever policies we can afford or we can achieve to hasten that day, because until we do, there will be a digital divide.;Dr. Cerf. I agree with that. In fact, it's a goal. A personal goal of mine is to see, literally, Internet everywhere.;The President. Now, what about the gene? That goes to patenting and all that, doesn't it?;[ The discussion and question-and-answer portion of the evening continued. The First Lady then introduced the outgoing Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Harold E. Varmus. ];Dr. Varmus. I assume by "outgoing" you mean I'm leaving as opposed to my social behavior. [ Laughter ];The President. You mean, as if an outgoing head of NIH were an oxymoron? [ Laughter ];[ Dr. Varmus made brief remarks about the role of genetics in cancer research at NIH. ];The President. Before we go on, I just want to say—we sort of glided over this—this man has done a magnificent job at the NIH for a long time, and I am very grateful. We thank you for it, for your service to your country.;[ The question-and-answer portion of the evening continued. ];Ms. Lovell. I think you just summed up the whole evening. And I'm going to give the President the last minute.;The President. Well, you know, that great humorist Ogden Nash once said, "Progress may be all right, but it's really gone on too long." [ Laughter ] And I was thinking that if he were here tonight, he would have to revise his opinion.;This has been an astonishing evening for me and for Hillary and I hope for all the American people and the people throughout the world who have been a part of this.;I want to thank you both. I want to just leave you with one thought: There are public responsibilities involved here, particularly for basic research. We have been very successful, and never more successful than under the leadership of Dr. Varmus, in getting strong bipartisan, nonpartisan support for investments in health. And I think that it's obvious that we can all see that as in our self-interest and as in the public interest. We want to live forever, and we're getting there.;But I think it's quite important also not to forget our responsibilities for basic research in other areas as well. And one of the things that we will come to know as the intersection of your two disciplines, informatics and genomics, come together, then we will have to study even more closely how all this that we know about the human body and its development interacts with changes in the environment.;So other areas of research will be also important, into things like global warming and climate change and the sustainability of the environment. And what I hope we can do is to build a broader consensus, as we look into the new millennium, for the whole research enterprise in those areas where it will never be productive in the beginning, or profitable for people like you, to do the beginning. And then we can find these things, and then the American entrepreneurial genius will take off.;And so I leave here with a renewed commitment to trying to help people like you get started. We may not understand it, those of us in politics, but we have an obligation to help you find it.;And when the first mouse graduates from Princeton, I will invite you both to deliver the commencement address. [ Laughter ];Thank you, and good evening.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Certification of Major Drug Producing and Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">November 10, 1999</td><td class="c7">Dear;In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I have determined that the following are major illicit drug producing or drug transit "countries" (including certain entities that are not sovereign states): Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.;This year I have removed Aruba and Belize from the majors list, added Belize as part of this year's Central America region of concern, added the entire Eastern and Southern Caribbean, including the Leeward and Windward Islands, Aruba, and the Netherlands Antilles, as a region of concern, and also added North Korea as a country of concern.;I wish to make clear that the inclusion of a country or entity on the majors list does not reflect an assessment of its government's counter-drug efforts or extent of cooperation with the United States. For example, among the reasons that a transit country or entity is placed on the majors list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and/or economic factors that allow drug traffickers to operate despite the most assiduous enforcement measures of the government concerned. In the case of Hong Kong and Taiwan, for instance, both entities have excellent counter-drug records and cooperate closely with the United States.;Aruba. Aruba was designated as a major transit country in 1997. While geography makes Aruba, like most of the other island countries in the Eastern and Southern Caribbean, a potential drug transit point, at this time we do not have evidence that it is a major transit country for drugs bound for the United States. Rather, the drug trade there appears directed toward Europe. We will continue, however, to keep Aruba under observation together with the rest of the islands in the region.;Belize. Belize's geographical position next to Mexico on the Yucatan peninsula offers wouldbe drug smugglers an attractive corridor for moving drugs into Mexico and on to the United States. Traffickers have used Belizean territory in previous years, when enforcement activities elsewhere enhanced the value of this route. Recently, however, we have detected significantly reduced drug flows to and through Belize.;Therefore, I have decided to remove Belize from the majors list. If future monitoring of Central America indicates a resumption of important drug flows through Belize bound for the United States, I will again place the country on the majors list.;Central America. Central America's location between South America and Mexico, together with its thousands of miles of coastline, several container-handling ports, the Pan-American Highway, and limited law enforcement capability make the entire region a logical conduit and transhipment area for illicit drugs bound for Mexico and the United States. The variance in seizure statistics from country to country, and their fluctuation from year to year, underscore my concern with Central America's potential and volatile role as a transit region. For instance, Panama and Guatemala continue to report more seizures than other countries in the region, while seizures to date by Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua are below levels during the same period in previous years and flow levels in El Salvador remain low. Taken together, these circumstances indicate a need to continue to monitor the situation in Central America.;Cuba. While there have been some reports that trafficking syndicates use Cuban land territory for moving drugs, we have yet to receive any confirmation that this traffic carries significant quantities of cocaine or heroin to the United States. In particular, the intelligence and law enforcement communities reviewed the information concerning whether the 7.2 metric ton shipment of cocaine seized in Colombia in December 1998, in a container reportedly headed to Cuba, was destined for the United States. Their judgment remains that Spain, and not the United States, was the intended final destination.;We also looked closely at the use of Cuban waters and airspace for transit of drugs to the United States, as the term "major drug transit country" is understood to apply to the land, waters, and airspace of a country over which sovereignty may be exercised, consistent with international law and United States practice. Although we have detected what appears to be some air and sea activity consistent with trafficking patterns, this activity has decreased significantly since last year and indicates a corresponding decrease in drug flow. We continue to keep trafficking in the area under close observation and will add Cuba to the majors list if the evidence warrants.;Eastern and Southern Caribbean. The Leeward and Windward Islands, together with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, constitute a broad geographical area through which drugs bound for the United States may pass en route from Latin America. We have no evidence at this time, however, that any of these Eastern Caribbean nations is a major drug transit country under the statutory definition. The information we do have indicates that drugs moving through the area are overwhelmingly destined for Europe. We are, therefore, keeping the region under observation, and I will add the relevant countries to the majors list should conditions warrant.;Iran. Although Iran in the past had been a traditional opium producing country, over the past few years the Government of Iran reported success in eradicating illicit opium poppy cultivation. A survey of the country this year revealed no detectable poppy cultivation in the traditional growing areas. While one cannot rule out some cultivation in remote parts of the country, it is unlikely that there would be enough to meet the threshold definition of a major drug producing country. Important quantities of opiates reportedly continue to transit Iran en route to Europe, but we have no evidence that these drugs significantly affect the United States, a requirement for designation as a major drug transit country under current legislation.;Malaysia. Malaysia was removed from the majors list last year because drug flow estimates did not indicate that drugs transiting the country had reached the United States in significant quantities.;North Korea. Our observations to date have been unable to confirm reports that significant quantities of opium poppy may be under cultivation in North Korea or that heroin originating in the country may be entering the international drug trade. We continue, however, to monitor the situation. If we confirm that there is indeed significant poppy cultivation, or that North Korea is a transit point for drugs significantly affecting the United States, I will add the country to the majors list.;Syria and Lebanon. We removed Syria and Lebanon from the majors list 2 years ago after we determined that there was no significant opium poppy cultivation in Lebanon's Biqa' Valley. Recent surveys have confirmed that there has been no detectable replanting of opium poppy, and we have no evidence that drugs transiting these countries significantly affect the United States. We continue, however, to keep the area under observation.;Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. We remain concerned about the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin moving through Turkey and neighboring countries to Western Europe along the Balkan Route. We have no clear evidence, however, that this heroin significantly affects the United States as required for a country to be designated a major transit country. In the event that we determine that heroin transiting Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia-Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, I will add the relevant countries to the majors list.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, we have not included them on the majors list since in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States. I have determined that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Central Asia. We have conducted probes in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These probes have not shown significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, I will add the relevant countries to the majors list.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks on Presenting the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights</td><td class="c6">December 6, 1999</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you very much, Belquis. Congressmen Gilman, Lewis, Jackson Lee, Reverend and Mrs. Jackson, Deputy Attorney General Holder, Harold Koh, Bob Seiple, Julia Taft, Hattie Babbitt, Bette Bao Lord, thank you for coming back.;School Shooting in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma;Ladies and gentlemen, before I begin, I need—because this is my only opportunity before the press today just to say a brief word about this school shooting this morning in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms are on the scene now working with the local authorities. I expect to get a detailed briefing shortly. Meanwhile, our prayers are with each of the children and their families, and the entire Fort Gibson community is—right now there are no fatalities, only people who are wounded, and we hope and pray it will stay that way.;Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights;It occurs to me that at some point tonight someone will be doing what some of us—Hillary says it's mostly a male thing—somebody will be channel-surfing tonight. [ Laughter ] And they will just come upon Belquis speaking. And they may stop and listen, or they may not. They may know what the Taliban is, or they may not. But I wonder if even someone who hears her will recognize that in nearly half the world today—in spite of the fact that for the first time in history more than half the people of the world live under governments of their own choosing—in nearly half the world, doing what Belquis just did, simply standing up and speaking freely, could get her arrested, jailed, beaten, even tortured. That's why we're here today.;I wonder if someone who just happened along her remarks tonight would understand that until people like Eleanor Roosevelt came along, the rest of the world didn't even recognize that the right to speak out is more than something enshrined in the American Constitution. It is truly an international human right.;Sometimes we forget how long it took the world to agree on a common definition, a universal declaration of what freedom actually means. Half a century ago the Universal Declaration on Human Rights said it in very simple words: "All human beings are free and equal in dignity and human rights. All have the right to life, liberty, and security. All are endowed with reason and conscience. All have the right to a standard of living adequate to health and well-being.;The real genius of the Declaration of Human Rights is that it affirmed that basic human rights are not cultural, but universal, that what a country does to people within its own borders is not its business alone, but the business of all of us. We in the United States know how hard it is to achieve the aspirations of that declaration. We've been living with it since our Founders, and living with our flaws in failing to meet up to its standards.;A hundred years ago Eleanor Roosevelt was a 15-year-old girl growing up in a country where women could not vote. Half a century ago, if the standards of the Universal Declaration were held up to segregated schools and lunch counters in the United States, we would have failed the test resoundingly.;This century has taught us that even though human rights are endowed by the hand of our Creator, they are ensured by the hearts and hands of men and women among us who cannot bear to see it otherwise. Inch by inch, such people have moved the world forward. Today we honor five brave Americans whose lives have made a difference. And we ask that all of us remember, in their triumphs, the struggles of people like Belquis, the continuing tensions in Africa, the continuing tensions in the Balkans, and elsewhere in the world where human rights are not yet secure.;It is said that when Burke Marshall first met Robert Kennedy, they sat across a table for 10 minutes and didn't say a single word. Those of us who had Burke Marshall in law school can believe that story. [ Laughter ] Perhaps now he will tell us who spoke first. But from that silent moment sprang a truly extraordinary partnership.;As Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division in the Kennedy administration, Burke Marshall was a bridge between Government and those activists fighting every day to end Jim Crow. Congressman John Lewis, who received this award last year, once recalled that whenever Martin Luther King or James Farmer needs to talk to somebody in Washington— needed to talk to someone in Washington, they would simply say, "call Burke.;His work was crucial to passing the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. After he had helped shape a new America, he later worked equally hard to shape young minds at Yale Law School.;I made a joke about Hillary and I being students. But I can tell you, I never will forget the first time I saw him. And I imagined how this man of slight stature and such a modest demeanor could almost shake with his passion for justice. It was quite something to see for the first time, and we are all in his debt.;When Leon Sullivan was 8 years old, he walked into a grocery store, slapped a nickel on the counter and said, "I want a Coke." The place being in segregated South Carolina, the shopkeeper threw him out. That moment was the beginning of his life's work. The pastor of two churches by the time he was at the ripe old age of 17, Reverend Sullivan went on to write the Sullivan principles, which called upon companies all around the world to act in a socially responsible manner. By compelling dozens of businesses to desegregate their plants in South Africa, his work helped to pull down apartheid.;Today, as the author of the new global Sullivan principle, Leon Sullivan is still changing the world. He's too big for anyone to deny him a Coke—[ laughter ]—but he has helped to win that right for millions of others who aren't so large.;Reverend Sullivan, thank you for keeping your eyes on the prize for nearly 80 years now. Thank you.;For those of you who wonder from time to time about whether there really could be a divine plan guiding our lives, consider this: In Spanish, the name, Dolores Huerta, means "sorrowful orchard." But if Dolores has her way, her name will be the only sorrowful orchard left in America.;She began her career teaching young migrant children but couldn't stand seeing them come to class hungry. So in 1962 she and Cesar Chavez cofounded the United Farm Workers. While Cesar Chavez worked the fields, she worked the boardrooms and the statehouses, negotiating contracts and fighting for laws that lifted the lives of thousands and thousands of Americans. In the process, she found time to raise 11 children.;Dolores, we thank you for all you have done and all you still do to promote the dignity and human rights of your family and America's family. Thank you.;It is no accident that when America opened its arms to Kosovar Albanians early this year, one of the first calls that went out was to a Dominican nun in the Fordham section of the Bronx. Scripture tells us that "if you spend yourselves on behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your life will rise in the darkness and your night will become like noonday." If that is true, there are few people who live their lives in more sunshine than Sister Jean Marshall.;Disturbed by the sight of refugee families picking up garbage off the street to feed their children, in 1983 Sister Jean founded St. Rita's Center for Immigrant and Refugee Services. In the days since, it has helped thousands of refugees, from Vietnam to Cambodia to Bosnia, to find jobs, learn English, live better lives.;Sister Jean, we thank you for all you are doing to make our democracy real and dreams come true for thousands who flee human rights abuses and come here expecting the Statue of Liberty to live up to her promise. Thank you.;Lastly, there are few people who have done more to directly build on Eleanor Roosevelt's work on women's rights around the world than Charlotte Bunch. Gloria Steinem once observed that for every question that comes up regarding women's rights, sooner or later someone asks, what does Charlotte think? [ Laughter ];As the founder of the Center for Women's Global Leadership at Rutgers University, she has worked to build a worldwide network of activists. As a result, when the World Conference on Human Rights was held in Vienna in 1993, for the first time there was a network in place to raise international awareness of issues like violence against women and gay and lesbian issues. And for the first time, the U.N. acknowledged that women's rights are human rights.;Today I think the best way to thank Charlotte Bunch is for the Senate to finally ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Thank you.;We honor these five Americans today with the thanks of a grateful nation. But let me say again, to echo what Hillary said earlier, if we truly want to honor their work, we must stay committed in the places where the glory has not come and continue to speak out for human rights around the world, from Burma to Cuba to Sudan, from Serbia to North Korea and Vietnam. We must do so because it's the right thing to do and the surest path to a world that is safe, democratic, and free.;In Afghanistan, we have strongly condemned the Taliban's despicable treatment of women and girls. We have worked with the United Nations to impose sanctions against the Taliban, while ensuring that the Afghan people continue to receive humanitarian assistance. We are Afghanistan's strongest critic, but also its largest humanitarian donor.;And today we take another step forward. I am pleased to announce that we will spend, next year, at least $2 million to educate and improve the health of Afghan women and children refugees. We are also making an additional $1 1/2 million available in emergency aid for those displaced by the recent Taliban offensive. And we're dramatically expanding our resettlement program for women and children who are not safe where they are.;But, as Belquis said, these are but temporary solutions. The Taliban must stop violating the rights of women and respect the human rights of all people. And we must continue to work until the day when Afghanistan has a government that reflects the wisdom of its people.;The whole world is also concerned about the plight of innocent people in Chechnya. Two weeks ago, at the OSCE summit in Turkey, I raised the issue directly with President Yeltsin. The people of Chechnya are in a terrible position, beleaguered by paramilitary groups and terrorists on the one hand and the Russian offensive on the other. I made clear that Russia's fight against terrorism is right, but the methods being used in Chechnya are wrong. And I am convinced they are counterproductive.;We've seen rocket and artillery attacks on largely civilian areas, with heavy losses of life and at least 200,000 people pushed from their homes. I'm deeply disturbed by reports that suggest that innocent Chechens will continue to bear the brunt of this war, and not the militants Russia is fighting.;Russia has set a deadline for all inhabitants, now, to leave Grozny or face the consequences. That means that there is a threat to the lives of the old, the infirm, the injured people, and other innocent civilians who simply cannot leave or are too scared to leave their homes. Russia will pay a heavy price for those actions with each passing day, sinking more deeply into a morass that will intensify extremism and diminish its own standing in the world.;Another country about which we must continue to express concern is China. China is progressing and opening to the world in many ways that are welcome, including its entry into the WTO. Yet its progress is still being held back by the Government's response to those who test the limits of freedom. A troubling example, of course, is the detention by Chinese authorities, of adherents of the Falun Gong movement.;Its targets are not political dissidents, and their practices and beliefs are unfamiliar to us. But the principle still, surely, must be the same: freedom of conscience and freedom of association. And our interest, surely, must be the same: seeing China maintain stability and growth at home by meeting, not stifling, the growing demands of its people for openness and accountability.;For all these challenges, we have to say that we enter the new millennium more hopeful than we have been at any time in the past century. The second half of this century began with delegates from 18 nations, including the United States, coming together to write the Universal Declaration. The century ends with 18 nations having come together with the United States to reaffirm those basic rights in Kosovo—with progress from Indonesia and East Timor to Nigeria.;Now, as I've said, more than half the world's people live under governments of their own choosing. Shortly before the Congress went home, the United States Senate unanimously ratified the International Convention against Child Labor, and I became the third head of state to sign the convention. We are moving, but we have much to do as we enter a new century. And again I would say to my fellow Americans, we all know that our efforts have to begin at home.;On the 10th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Eleanor Roosevelt dedicated a book called "In Your Hands." On that day she said, and I quote, human rights begin "in small places, close to home... Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.;Today we honor that message by honoring five people whose work close to home has made the whole world a better place. May their work continue to inspire us all for generations yet to come.;Lieutenant Colonel, read the citations.;[ At this point, Lt. Col. Carlton D. Everhart, USAF, Air Force Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President and First Lady presented the awards. ];The President. Thank you for coming. Thank you for honoring these great people. Thank you for reminding us of all the important work still to be done, Belquis.;We're adjourned. Thank you.</td></tr>

Analysis of the relevant U.S. vital national interests, as required under section 490(b)(3) of the Act in the case of the countries certified on this basis, is attached. Given that the performance of all of these countries/jurisdictions has differed, I have also attached an explanatory statement for each of the other countries/jurisdictions subject to this determination.;You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.;WILLIAM J. CLINTON;THE WHITE HOUSE;Washington, February 29, 2000.;Statements of Explanation;Afghanistan;In 1999 Afghanistan cultivated a larger opium poppy crop and harvested more opium gum than any other country by a wide margin. U.S. sources estimate a 23 percent increase in the opium harvest, while United Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) data point to a more dramatic 70 percent increase. There were also increases in the refining of opium into heroin and in drug trafficking from Afghanistan into neighboring countries. The largest of Afghanistan's factions, the Taliban, which controls 85-90 percent of Afghanistan and 97 percent of the area where opium is cultivated, derives significant income from every phase of drug production and trafficking. In spite of its own 1997 ban on the cultivation of opium poppy, the Taliban acknowledge they tax the crop at about 10 percent, and allow it to be sold in open bazaars. Crop taxation imparts legitimacy to opium cultivation and distribution, and means that the Taliban benefits directly from the entire opium business. The Taliban also receives payments directly from traffickers.;The United States Government (USG) has spoken about the drug problem directly with Taliban officials and indirectly through the UNDCP. We have repeatedly urged the Taliban to enforce its 1997 ban on opium poppy cultivation. The Taliban response was at least a 23 percent increase in opium production over 1998. We also urged the Taliban to honor its commitments to reduce poppy cultivation in exchange for the delivery of alternative development assistance. But in a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) project area receiving generous USG funding, poppy cultivation surged 68 percent, according to a UNDCP survey. Heroin labs are proliferating throughout Afghanistan, particularly near international borders.;The Taliban claims success for some counter-drug measures. According to the UNDCP, the Taliban destroyed 34 drug laboratories. The Taliban also has made unverified claims of seizures of 500 kg of opium, 70 kg of heroin, and 1200 liters of acetic anhydride and other heroin production chemicals. The Taliban Leader, Mullah Omar, who promulgated the 1997 ban on opium cultivation, ordered a one-third nation-wide reduction in poppy cultivation for the 1999-2000 growing season but, as noted, past commitments were not honored.;Overall, there was a sharp increase in poppy cultivation, in refining of opium into heroin, and in trafficking of illicit opiates in Afghanistan. There is a growing body of evidence that the largest of Afghanistan's factions, the Taliban, is fully complicit in every phase of drug production and trafficking. Sharp increases in large-scale opium cultivation and trafficking in Afghanistan, plus the failure of the authorities to initiate an appropriate law enforcement response, preclude a determination that Afghanistan has taken adequate steps on its own or that it has sufficiently cooperated with USG counter-drug efforts to meet the goals and objectives of the UN 1988 Drug Convention, to which Afghanistan is a party. In the absence of verifiable and unambiguous steps by the Taliban to stop the promotion of poppy cultivation (such as an end to the opium crop tax), the United States and other concerned countries are compelled to redirect their counter-drug efforts to interdiction and border control strategies in surrounding countries.;The Bahamas;The Bahamas is a major transit country for drugs en route to the United States from South America and the Caribbean. The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas (GCOB) and the USG continue to enjoy a productive counter-drug working relationship.;The Bahamas is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and the GCOB works to meet its goals and objectives as well as those of U.S.-Bahamas bilateral drug control agreements. The GCOB places a high priority on combating drug transshipments through its archipelago and works closely with the USG on Operation Bahamas and Turks and Caicos (OPBAT). The USG looks forward to assisting The Bahamas to improve its maritime end-game capability, without which sustained drug interdiction, arrest and conviction of traffickers, and the forfeiting of their assets is improbable. Given the volume of commercial shipping through The Bahamas, the GCOB needs to rigorously implement its chemical control laws to prevent illegal diversion of precursor and essential chemicals.;Bahamian authorities continue monitoring bank compliance and investigating suspicious financial transactions under the 1996 money laundering law. Increased supervision of the offshore banking sector and training of all financial sector employees, however, will be necessary in order to increase the number of suspicious activity reports, which is still very small given the size of The Bahamas financial services sector. Despite several public statements of commitment, the GCOB has not established a financial intelligence unit (FIU) or to seek membership in the Egmont Group. In 1999, the GCOB passed legislation which allows designation of the United States under Bahamian asset forfeiture laws, based on reciprocity. This will allow Bahamian courts to enforce U.S. forfeiture orders in many cases.;The GCOB took further steps in 1999 to strengthen its judicial system, with USG assistance. Despite these efforts, no major Bahamian drug trafficker has been convicted in The Bahamas and sent to prison, due largely to continuing delays in the courts. In addition, weak bail laws allow arrested drug traffickers to obtain bail and continue transshipping drugs while awaiting trail. Notwithstanding committed and talented judicial leadership, The Bahamas needs to improve the effectiveness of its court system and its Attorney General's office in gaining convictions against major drug traffickers. The Bahamas also needs to improve its responsiveness to U.S. requests under the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) and to speed the processing of extradition cases.;In October 1999, for the first time in recent history, a Bahamian law enforcement official was assassinated, allegedly by Bahamian drug dealers in retaliation for his stand against a corrupt official or to prevent his testimony. The GCOB should ratify the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and assure that corrupt public officials are effectively prosecuted. Finally, the GCOB needs to move quickly to complete and adopt a comprehensive national drug strategy containing goals and objectives as well as measures of effectiveness.;Bolivia;Exceeding the schedule of its own five year plan to eliminate all illicit coca from Bolivia, in 1999 the Banzer administration eradicated an unprecedented 16,999 hectares of coca, for a net reduction of 43 percent.;Although Bolivia remains the world's third largest producer of cocaine, with the ability to produce a potential 70 metric tons, Bolivian cocaine became less marketable in 1999 due to a very successful law enforcement effort to prevent precursor chemicals from being smuggled in from neighboring countries. As a result of significant law enforcement pressure, Bolivian cocaine producers were forced to use less efficient means of processing with substitute or recycled chemicals, and cutting agents, such as manitol. The purity of finished Bolivian cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) dropped to as low as 47 percent, causing Brazilian and other traffickers to buy only Bolivian cocaine base and finish the processing in Brazil.;The GOB began preparations for an eradication program in the Yungas in 2000 to eliminate the coca exceeding the legally allowable 12,000 hectares. There is evidence that Yungas coca is being diverted to the illicit market for conversion to cocaine products.;Despite a slight downturn in the Bolivian export sector in 1999, export volumes of nearly all alternative development crops improved. Banana exports to Chile and Argentina increased 20 percent over 1998. Demand for alternative development assistance by former coca farmers, however, is exceeding supply.;In 1999, the Bolivian legislature enacted the final portion of the judicial reform package, the new code of criminal procedures. It establishes an accusatory, adversarial, oral, public criminal trial system that may also help to diminish corruption and improve the credibility of the judicial system. The new code permits the police to use undercover agents and to make controlled deliveries of illicit drugs and other contraband. The Judicial Council, created in 1998 to depoliticize the selection of judges and to serve as a mechanism for disciplining members of the judiciary, had some of its powers to administratively remove corrupt judges diminished by the Constitutional Tribunal, which ruled that members of the judiciary can only be removed subsequent to a final judgement by a criminal court.;For the third year since the passage of the anti-money laundering law, no action was taken against money laundering. The legal ambiguities regarding asset seizure and forfeiture have not been resolved, and the system remains inefficient.;Brazil;Brazil is a significant transit country for illicit drugs en route to the United States, and a major producer of precursor chemicals and synthetic drugs. Since taking office in 1995, the administration of President Fernando Enrique Cardoso has demonstrated a firm commitment to countering the flow of illegal drugs through Brazilian territory, and to establishing an effective law enforcement infrastructure capable of taking action against the domestic and international criminal syndicates engaged in drug trafficking. In 1999, the Government of Brazil (GOB) worked closely with regional neighbors and U.S. law enforcement agencies in pursuit of mutual counter-drug objectives, achieving particularly impressive results against corruption and money laundering.;The most visible initiative in 1999 was the formation in April of the Congressional Panel of Inquiry (CPI) on drug trafficking. The Panel's high-profile investigations into the country's organized drug networks have led to over 115 arrests, including many tainted government officials. Through its actions, the CPI has illustrated the drug trade's corrosive effect on public institutions and energized previously isolated voices against corruption and trafficker impunity.;Criminal interests have long exploited Brazil's highly developed financial sector, particularly as a haven for illicit-drug profits. In 1999 the GOB demonstrated a firm commitment to fighting the problem of money laundering, and implemented regulations to increase the effectiveness of Brazil's anti-money laundering regime. The Brazilian Central Bank created a special internal agency to trace money laundering, and Brazil joined the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the Egmont Group, two international bodies charged with improving anti-money laundering efforts.;Brazilian authorities seized more cocaine in 1999 than in 1998, and cannabis seizures increased by six-fold. As in past years, Brazilian authorities identified no opium or coca production in 1999. The GOB acted vigorously against cannabis production in the country's northeast, eradicating over three times as many hectares as in 1998.;Burma;Burma is the world's second largest source of illicit opium and heroin, exceeded only by Afghanistan, and currently accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total production of Southeast Asian opium. Largely due to severe drought conditions in poppy growing areas, production and cultivation continued to decline significantly in 1999 for the third year in a row. In 1999 there were an estimated 89,500 hectares under opium poppy cultivation, down 31 percent from 1998. This hectarage yielded a maximum of 1,090 metric tons of opium gum, 38 percent lower than in 1998 and less than half the average production during the last decade. The Government of Burma (GOB) maintained most of its opium crop-eradication efforts and expanded the program to an additional 9,800 acres.;Seizures of methamphetamine in 1999 exceeded 1998's record figures, although opium and heroin seizures were well below 1998 levels. Burma made its first airport seizures of illicit drugs in 1999. While there were cases of drug interdiction and arrests of members of some cease-fire groups for drug trafficking, the GOB has been unwilling or unable to take on the most powerful groups directly. Cease-fire agreements with insurgent ethnic groups dependent on the drug trade implicitly tolerate continued involvement in drug trafficking for varying periods of time. The ethnic armies, such as the United Wa State Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, remain armed and heavily involved in the heroin trade.;The GOB expressed support for eradication efforts, crop substitution, and development assistance, but allocated few resources to such projects. GOB policy is to force the leaders in the ethnic areas to spend their own revenues, including from the drug trade, on social and physical infrastructure. The approach limits the GOB's ability to continue or expand its counter-drug efforts.;Burma's 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law conforms to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and contains useful legal tools for addressing money laundering, seizing drug-related assets, and prosecuting drug conspiracy cases. GOB officials, claiming they lack sufficient expertise, have been slow to implement the law, targeting few, if any, major traffickers and their drug-related assets. Money laundering in Burma and the return of drug profits laundered elsewhere are thought to be significant factors in the overall Burmese economy, although the extent of this problem is impossible to measure accurately. The cease-fire agreements condone money laundering, as the government encouraged these groups to invest in "legitimate" businesses as an alternative to trafficking, thus extending to them the opportunity to sanitize past illicit proceeds with investments in hotels and construction companies, for example.;The Burmese continued to refuse to render drug lord Chang Qifu on grounds that he had not violated his 1996 surrender agreement. The 1988 UN Drug convention obligates parties, including Burma, to prosecute such traffickers.;The GOB's counter-drug efforts in 1999 showed progress in a number of areas: methamphetamine and ephedrine seizures increased, crop eradication continued with modest expansion, anti-drug forces conducted more vigorous law-enforcement efforts, and members of some cease-fire groups were arrested for drug trafficking. Such efforts must be stepped up, however, if they are to have a significant impact on the overall trafficking problem.;On balance, the USG remains concerned that Burma's efforts are not commensurate with the extent of the drug problem within its borders. Large-scale poppy cultivation and opium production continue, decreasing in the last few years largely because of severe drought conditions rather than eradication programs. The GOB's effective toleration of money laundering, its unwillingness to implement its drug laws, and its failure to render notorious traffickers under indictment in the United States all continue to be serious concerns.;Cambodia;In view of Cambodia's geographic location and general state of lawlessness, it is likely that drugs transited Cambodia en route the West, including the United States. For that reason, Cambodia was designated a major drug transit country in 1999. Political turmoil in Cambodia has effectively precluded a fully credible anti-drug effort for the last two years. Although Cambodia has taken some positive steps to improve drug enforcement in 1999, these steps were insufficient to qualify for full certification.;Steps forward included increased emphasis on eradication of illicit marijuana plantations. Prime Minister Hun Sen and others have publicly threatened provincial governors with dismissal if they tolerate marijuana cultivation. At least one large (160 hectare, or about 400 acre) plantation was eradicated as the deadline for certification approached. There were also several first-time drug seizures at Phnom Penh's international airport. The President and the Chief Prosecutor of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court were removed for corruption, other judges are under investigation. A police commander, suspected of dealing in illicit drugs was removed, and Cambodia reorganized a supervisory coordinating agency called the National Drug Policy Board, replacing officials generally viewed as ineffective with more respected officials. High level government officials made statements emphasizing their opposition to synthetic drug production in Cambodia, and pressed efforts to confiscate unauthorized weapons, both positive steps in countering a drift towards lawlessness. Cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was excellent.;Corruption remains an endemic problem in Cambodia, however, and this problem adversely affects drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and ill-trained police and judicial officials have frequently looked the other way in drug and other criminal cases. Cambodia remains a refuge for criminal elements because enforcement is ineffective and corrupt officials can be paid to release those that may be apprehended. The combination of incompetence and venality, even at high levels in government and the police, pose an ongoing challenge to improved drug law enforcement. In short, there has been no fundamental institutional reform to meet the law enforcement challenge Cambodia faces from drug traffickers and other lawless elements. Thus, despite some improvements, Cambodia still failed to meet the legal standards for full certification.;A vital national interests certification is necessary this year in order to protect U.S. vital national interests in Cambodia, including promoting democracy in Cambodia and stability in the region. Democracy in Cambodia is not yet firmly established. The democratically-elected coalition government, which came to power in Cambodia last year continues to face enormous challenges on all fronts, including the formation of an international tribunal to try former leaders of the Khmer Rouge. Cambodia also remains vulnerable to drug trafficking and other crime upsurges. Should counter-drug sanctions be imposed, it would not be possible for the United States to provide strategically-placed assistance to respond to potential crises or to strengthen Cambodia's economic and institutional bases for a democratic system. On balance, the risks to U.S. interests in promoting democracy and stability in the region if counter-drug sanctions were imposed would outweigh the risks posed by Cambodia's failure to fully implement effective drug control.;Colombia;Colombia remains the world's largest cocaine producer: over three-quarters of the world's cocaine hydrochloride is processed in Colombia. Still, Colombia met the certification criteria in 1999 due to important strides made in combating illicit drugs and its full cooperation with USG counter-drug efforts. The Pastrana administration has demonstrated a clear commitment to combating the illegal drug industry in Colombia. That commitment led to a number of very concrete achievements in 1999.;In September, the Government of Colombia (GOC) unveiled its "Plan Colombia," a comprehensive strategy to address the many interrelated challenges facing the country. The USG supports the work of the GOC in formulating and beginning to implement this comprehensive strategy. Importantly, both "Plan Colombia" and the Pastrana administration's National Drug Control Strategy couple alternative development with aerial eradication of illicit crops.;Colombian authorities continued to cooperate with the USG on a variety of specific projects. In October, Operation Millennium, a coordinated operation among Colombian, Mexican and U.S. law enforcement agencies, resulted in the arrest of more than 30 suspects.;The Colombian National Police (CNP) continued its outstanding counter-drug tradition. The CNP received increased support from the Colombian armed services and is poised to begin joint operations in southern Colombia with the army's first special counter-drug battalion. Such joint operations are vital for the future of the program due to the threat to counter-drug operations from heavily armed traffickers and other illegal armed groups that are involved in many aspects of drug trafficking.;The GOC made particularly strong advances in combating maritime trafficking. A port security program is now operating in all of the nation's major ports, and in the past year resulted in the seizure of 16 metric tons of cocaine. In September, a standing interdiction operations plan was signed to augment an existing maritime agreement, leading to three U.S.-Colombian combined maritime interdiction patrols. Also in September, U.S. and Colombian authorities reached an accommodation concerning the volume of evidence required by Colombian prosecutors and other evidentiary concerns.;GOC efforts have also focused on drug trafficking by air. The percentage of successful Colombian Air Force (FAC) interdiction attempts has increased from 25 percent in 1997 to nearly 40 percent in 1999. At the same time, the number of suspicious aircraft which radar has detected flying to or from Colombia has fallen from 231 in 1997 to fewer than 100 in 1999. The CNP's civil aviation registration program inspected 343 aircraft in 1999, seizing 50 of these for violations.;The aerial eradication program succeeded in treating more than 50,000 hectares of illicit crops in 1999, although totals were less than last year's record level. The CNP also had a strong year in terms of seizures, totaling 30 metric tons of cocaine hydrochloride and base, 140 metric tons of coca leaf, and 644 kilos of heroin, morphine and opium.;The level of cooperation between the Colombian military and police continued to improve in 1999. Information sharing advanced to a higher level with the inclusion of both military and CNP personnel at the Joint Intelligence Center (JIC), while interdiction and eradication efforts both received a boost with the creation of the new counter-drug battalion. Created to work hand-in-glove with the CNP's anti-drug units, the battalion will provide the police with needed support as operations move into high-risk, coca-rich areas such as Putumayo Department.;In November, the GOC extradited alleged heroin trafficker Jaime Orlando Lara Nausa, the first Colombian citizen extradited to the United States in nine years. Behind the very public leadership of President Pastrana, Colombian officials proceeded despite drug traffickers' attempted legal roadblocks and bombings possibly linked to the extraditions. This commitment demonstrated the GOC's willingness to send drug traffickers to justice in the United States regardless of citizenship.;GOC officials also enacted important institutional changes in 1999. The National Judicial Police Council adopted a unified training curriculum and made it mandatory for all Colombian investigators after January 2000. For the first time, all Colombian law enforcement investigators will receive the same training.;Overall, Colombian counter-drug efforts continued to improve in 1999, demonstrating the true commitment of the Pastrana administration to cooperate fully with the United States in combating the illegal traffic in drugs.;Dominican Republic;The Dominican Republic is a significant transit country for South American drugs, mostly cocaine, moving to the United States. Drugs are transported into the Dominican Republic by air, sea, and across the land border with Haiti. They are then moved onward by air and sea to Puerto Rico and mainland United States.;During 1999, the Government of the Dominican Republic (GODR) continued to cooperate fully with the USG on counter-drug goals and objectives.;The GODR extradited nine Dominican s to the United States in 1999, and kept several other fugitives in custody awaiting decisions on extradition requests. The National Drug Council (CND) drafted a National Drug Strategy. A group of private attorneys energetically promoted the passage of a newly drafted anti-money laundering bill modeled on current Organization of American States (OAS) standards. The GODR began the process of developing an anti-corruption bill. The draft strategy and both bills are scheduled for submission to congress in 2000.;A ministerial-level bilateral meeting with Haiti achieved historic border control accords, which were subsequently approved at the highest levels of the GODR. In 1999, the GODR activated a fourth border control unit, deployed its drug detection dog unit to the Haitian border, and took steps to double the size of the dog unit in 2000.;Dominican forces participated in combined operations under the bilateral Maritime Counter-drug Interdiction Agreement. The GODR extended for one-year temporary overflight authority for USG anti-drug aircraft and vessels. In cooperation with the U.S. military, the Dominican Navy and Army engaged in joint counter-drug exercises.;The National Drug Control Directorate (DNCD) worked closely with its counterpart, the DEA, on drug, fugitive, and special investigations, drug operations, and border interdiction during 1999. DNCD has begun to require its special unit personnel to take polygraphs, and has also initiated pre-employment and periodic random drug testing for its employees.;For the first time, the GODR authorized wiretaps for use in drug prosecutions. It also arrested and jailed on passport fraud charges the top money manager for the Coneo family, the dominant Colombian drug trafficking organization operating on Hispaniola.;We will continue to encourage the Dominican Republic to regularize its extradition process. GODR should also: act on a pending amendment to enhance the bilateral maritime agreement, increase cocaine seizures, which amounted to less than half the amount seized in 1998, and strengthen its weak judicial system, which continues to hamper law enforcement efforts.;Ecuador;Ecuador continues to serve as a major transit route for cocaine destined for the United States, and for precursor chemicals destined for drug processing labs in Colombia and Peru. Despite suffering under the effects of the country's worst economic crisis in seventy years, the Government of Ecuador (GOE) pursued an active counter-drug agenda in 1999 to considerable effect, and cooperation between the GOE and the USG was excellent.;The Ecuadorian National Police (ENP) seized a record 10 metric tons of cocaine and coca base in 1999, more than doubling 1998's total of 3.9 metric tons. Heroin seizures also increased significantly, from 58 kilograms in 1998 to 81 kilograms in 1999. The ENP also seized a record amount of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and other precursor chemicals.;Along with these tactical successes, the GOE implemented structural reforms to their judicial system and law enforcement agencies that have the potential to enhance the country's law enforcement infrastructure. A unified anti-drug division was established within the ENP, consolidating various specialized interdiction units into a coherent organization for the first time. The customs service was privatized to maximize efficiency and bolster interdiction efforts. In November 1999, the Ecuadorian Congress passed a new criminal procedural code, intended to alter the country's criminal justice system from a secretive, inquisitorial to an open, accusatorial system similar to the U.S. model. In addition, the GOE published a five-year counter-drug strategy which clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of relevant GOE agencies in the fight against international drug trafficking.;The GOE also increased its commitment to regional interdiction efforts, most visibly in November 1999 when the GOE and the USG completed a 10-year agreement permitting U.S. regional counter-drug detection and monitoring missions to operate from an Ecuadorian air force base in Manta. The GOE also completed a Joint Information Coordination Center (JICC) in Guayaquil, and plans to integrate this center with the national anti-drug division headquarters.;Guatemala;In 1999, President Arzu continued to implement the peace accords that ended 36 years of internal conflict. Government of Guatemala (GOG) efforts are now focused on combating violent crime, organized crime and other domestic problems. The GOG fully cooperated with the United States in combating counter-drug trafficking in Guatemala and elsewhere in the region. Guatemala has taken steps to implement, at the operational level, the provisions of the 1988 UN Drug convention. However, legislative support for ratification of a full maritime counter-drug agreement and adoption of money laundering legislation has not yet been obtained.;Guatemala's location, scarce law enforcement resources, and a weak judiciary and penal system permitted its continued use by traffickers as a transshipment and storage point for cocaine destined for the United States via Mexico. Along with increased use of motor vehicle and container shipments, there has been an increase in airdrops of illicit drugs over Guatemalan territory for consolidation and transshipment. With USG assistance, the Department of Anti-Narcotics Police (DOAN) has stepped up training to develop air interdiction and related capabilities. The expanding self-funded port security program and the trained DOAN agents have made impressive seizures in the past year.;The consolidation of the National Civilian Police (PNC) continues on track with full integration of the DOAN. The USG-trained DOAN seized over 10 metric tons of cocaine in 1999. This year the drug prosecutor assistance program maintained its 90 percent conviction rate, with some traffickers receiving sentences of up to 20 years. Somewhat disturbing, however, were several cases in which judges released suspected drug traffickers on questionable grounds. The new drug prosecutor's field office opened this year in Quetzaltenango accounted for 110 successful prosecutions in 1999.;Guatemala is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and most GOG law enforcement activities are fully consistent with its goals and objectives. However, some of the convention's provisions have not been codified into law and regulations, including provisions on extradition and money laundering. The GOG does not encourage or facilitate illicit production or distribution of illicit drugs or controlled substances.;In 1999 the GOG began implementation of its national drug policy, the anti-drug master plan and national strategy which incorporates both demand and supply reduction objectives to be accomplished by specified ministries. The GOG provided additional funding to the plan's implementers to attack the alarming increase in drug abuse documented last year. The GOG also took major steps in implementing assets seizure and precursor chemicals regulations.;Haiti;Haiti is a significant transshipment point for drugs, primarily cocaine, moving through the Caribbean from South America to the United States. The USG cannot certify Haiti as having fully cooperated with the United States on drug control, or as having taken adequate steps on its own, to meet the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to which Haiti is a party. However, U.S. vital national interests require that foreign assistance continue to be provided to Haiti.;The USG recognizes that because Haiti had no Parliament during 1999, no legislation could be enacted or international agreements ratified. However, Haiti failed to make sufficient progress on many anti-drug objectives that did not require parliamentary action, but only implementation by the Government of Haiti (GOH). The GOH failed to: draft or update any pending anti-money laundering or anti-corruption legislation, revise and implement the draft national drug control strategy, create mechanisms to enforce standards of conduct and liabilities for GOH officials in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed by Haiti at the 1997 Bridgetown Summit, vigorously investigate and prosecute drug-related corruption involving GOH officials, resolve and report on the "450 kilo affair" in which policemen were allegedly involved in the 1998 theft of a large cocaine shipment, set up a special financial analysis unit to combat money laundering, and join the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF).;Haiti also failed to make sufficient progress in the area of law enforcement. Part of its overall lack of success in this area is due to Haiti's inadequate judicial system, the still limited capabilities of the five-year-old Haitian National Police (HNP), and the inexperience of the three-year-old police anti-drug unit (BLTS). In addition, the HNP currently does not have the ability to intercept drug airdrops. The GOH failed to increase its drug seizure rate over 1998's performance, the amount of cocaine seized in 1999 was one-third that of 1998, although the estimated flow of cocaine increased by nearly one-quarter. The GOH also failed to double the size of the BLTS as planned, or to enforce interagency cooperation between the HNP and the customs and immigration services. This lack of cooperation continues to impede counter-drug efforts inside the customs control areas at the airport and other ports of entry in Haiti.;GOH's international cooperation in 1999 was significant, including ongoing implementation of the 1997 U.S.-Haiti maritime counter-drug interdiction agreement even though parliamentary action to bring the agreement into force has not yet been accomplished. GOH cooperated with several international counter-drug operations, one of which resulted in the arrest and expulsion from Haiti of two key members of a major international drug operation. Haitian authorities also continued to work with their counter-drug counterparts in the Dominican Republic to stem the flow of illicit drugs over the land border.;U.S. vital national interests require that Haiti be certified. A cutoff of bilateral assistance mandated by denial of certification would threaten security and democratic stability in Haiti, both of which bear immediately and directly on U.S. ability to disrupt the flow of both illicit drugs and undocumented Haitian migrants into the United States. A cutoff would require termination of important USG initiatives, including programs targeting electoral support, police development, economic growth, education, social stability, hunger and environmental degradation. These programs attack the roots of Haitian poverty and hopelessness, chief catalysts for Haitian involvement in the drug trade and illegal immigration into the United States. The programs also address the underlying problems in the Haitian law enforcement and judicial system, especially endemic corruption and the lack of a strong professional tradition, both of which contribute to weak counter-drug performance. If critical U.S. aid is withdrawn, and U.S. support for the electoral process and public security is curtailed, assistance to illicit traffickers of drugs and migrants will be an unintended consequence.;The risks posed to U.S. vital national interests by a cutoff of bilateral assistance outweigh the risks posed by Haiti's failure to cooperate fully with the USG, or to take adequate steps on its own, to combat the illicit drugs. Accordingly, Haiti is granted a vital national interests certification.;Hong Kong;Although the USG continued to view Hong Kong as a major drug transit center in 1999 because of its location and developed infrastructure, Hong Kong's role as a major transit/staging area for the shipment of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States appears to have diminished over the last three years.;In 1999 Hong Kong continued its exemplary efforts to stop illicit drugs from being trafficked across its border with China and through its port. Through October 1999, Hong Kong officials seized 205 kilograms of heroin (nearly the amount seized in all of 1998), 35.8 kilograms of cannabis, 16.7 kilograms of cocaine, and 9,811 kilograms of methamphetamine. In the same period, 7,620 individuals were arrested for drug-related offenses. Drug-detection capabilities were enhanced in several important areas: the number of drug-sniffing dogs at the border and airport increased from 124 to 133, and high-tech equipment was procured to detect illicit drugs in packages, facilitate the inspection of baggage and cargo, and use in clearing air and sea cargo.;With respect to precursor chemicals, Hong Kong amended legislation to tighten control of the transshipment, removal, and storage of potassium permanganate and to require a license from the Commissioner of Customs and Excise before potassium permanganate can be imported, exported, or manufactured. Control of several additional chemicals was also tightened in 1999 in response to resolutions passed by the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs. The legislature also began working to amend legislation to enhance control of norephedrine.;Hong Kong also introduced new legislation to strengthen the anti-moneylaundering regime and laws affecting drug profits and organized crime. New reporting requirements for financial transactions went into effect, and sentences for money laundering have been lengthened.;Hong Kong and U.S. law enforcement agencies continued to cooperate effectively on investigations into the movement of illegal drugs and on money-laundering cases. The Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement received legislative approval in Hong Kong and will enter into force in early 2000. The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Agreement with the United States and with Sri Lanka came into force. Hong Kong also concluded similar agreements with other countries and the European Union.;In 1999 Hong Kong continued to implement new initiatives to strengthen its already outstanding counter-drug efforts, and Hong Kong authorities at all levels continued their close cooperation with the United States and other countries to defeat drug trafficking.;India;India is the world's largest producer of licit opium. Located between Afghanistan and Burma, the two primary world sources of illicitly grown opium, India also is a transit point for heroin, generally destined for Europe. Heroin is produced in and trafficked through India, but evidence to indicate that significant quantities of heroin from India reach the United States is scant. The Government of India (GOI) has a cooperative working relationship with DEA, and India is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;The GOI uncovered a trafficking network operating in several Indian cities to ship locally-produced heroin to Sri Lanka, and seized a related heroin lab and over 100 kg of heroin. The GOI also broke up and arrested an international trafficking operation routing Afghan heroin to North America and seized 77 kilograms of heroin. Overall, heroin seizures rose 7 percent. More importantly, two well-organized trafficking operations were disrupted.;The GOI tightened controls on the precursor ephedrine hydrochloride by listing it as a controlled substance under its Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act. The GOI traced 9 tons of acetic anhydride intended for Afghanistan and had it seized in Dubai. The GOI enacted money-laundering legislation at the end of 1999.;The GOI annually takes forceful steps to prevent illicit cultivation and production. The GOI appears to have had genuine success in reducing illicit poppy cultivation, which in 1999 was just a fraction of what it was five years ago. India met formally with Pakistan in 1999 to discuss drug matters and is committed to continuing the process and to developing practical results, whichhave been limited to date. In 1999 India also met with Burmese officials to discuss cross-border counter-drug issues.;Production and stockpile of licit opium in India has clearly not exceeded licit demand. On the contrary, India's stockpile has been barely adequate for some time. The GOI did not make as much progress as hoped for this year in rebuilding its depleted buffer stock of licit opium. With excellent weather, the harvest should have been 1300 metric tons, but at least in part due to some diversion from licit production, the harvest was only 971 tons, too small to rebuild stocks to levels recommended by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). The GOI did boost opium production from 260 to 971 metric tons, sufficient to satisfy international demand for licit opium, even if carry-over stocks remain inadequate.;India is the only licit opium producing country with a notable diversion problem. However, the exact extent of this diversion is unclear. India has had an elaborate and expensive-to-maintain system in place to counter this threat of diversion for years, and India took important additional steps to avert diversion this year. For example, to discourage diversion of licit opium, the GOI raised prices paid to farmers, and added other incentives for higher yields. The GOI also threatened stiff penalties for those convicted of diversion. Licit opium diversion controls expanded in 1998-1999 and have been continued in 1999-2000. Still, credible reports suggest that diversion may have increased during the 1998-1999 growing season despite GOI actions. Although India is taking adequate steps to prevent significant diversion, there are additional measures India could take to improve its control regime. The GOI has not yet agreed to USG suggestions to undertake a comprehensive joint licit opium yield survey, which would provide a firmer scientific basis for the GOI to set Minimum Qualifying Yields (MQY) for farmers. Setting these yields correctly, by region, helps limit diversion.;Jamaica;Jamaica is a major transit point for South American cocaine en route to the United States as well as the largest Caribbean producer and exporter of marijuana. During 1999, the Government of Jamaica (GOJ) made progress towards meeting the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention. At regional meetings, GOJ officials actively supported counter-drug initiatives. Bilateral counter-drug cooperation is good and improving. In the area of maritime law enforcement, Jamaican forces continued to participate in combined operations under the U.S.-Jamaica bilateral maritime agreement.;In March 1999, Jamaica took an important step in its effort to create an anti-money laundering regime which meets international standards by amending the 1996 Money Laundering Act to require the reporting of suspicious transactions. However, further amendment to the law is required to address the critical issue of money laundering in relation to the proceeds of other serious crime. The GOJ has stated that, as a first step, it has drafted amendments to the money-laundering act that will add fraud and firearms offenses as predicate offenses. The GOJ is in the process of establishing a financial analysis unit to identify money-laundering activities, but has not yet provided staff for the unit. Jamaica's current asset forfeiture regime does not permit the GOJ to take full advantage of the forfeiture mechanism to augment the resources of its anti-drug agencies and deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crime. Current law requires the conviction of a criminal drug defendant prior to commencing a forfeiture action. In 1999, Parliament passed legislation permitting the GOJ to enter into agreements with other governments to share assets confiscated from drug traffickers and other criminals. The GOJ enacted a Precursor Chemicals Act and has budgeted for implementation of chemical controls. In late 1999, the GOJ introduced a bill in Parliament establishing drug courts, the bill passed both houses and now awaits the Governor General's signature.;Transparency International and other organizations have reported that corruption is viewed as a grave problem in Jamaica—drug trafficking adds to the problem. The GOJ's anti-corruption legislation, introduced in Parliament in 1998, passed the House and Senate in different versions, a compromise bill is currently being crafted by a joint select committee of Parliament. The GOJ's position is that passage of the Anti-Corruption Act must occur before it can ratify the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, which Jamaica signed in March 1996. The GOJ has a policy of investigating credible reports of police corruption, including those related to drugs, but more needs to be done to root out corruption in the public sector.;The GOJ extradited four people to the United States in 1999, there are sixteen active pending extradition requests. In 1999, the GOJ developed, with USG assistance, a special fugitive apprehension team to target and apprehend fugitives from justice. The team has thus far located three fugitives and provided information for several U.S.-based investigations. The GOJ arrested 6,718 drug offenders in 1999. Nevertheless, no major drug traffickers were arrested or convicted during 1999, and they continue to operate with apparent impunity. The GOJ agreed in 1998 to develop a vetted special investigative unit to target drug kingpins, but the unit is not yet in existence. While the GOJ has stated its intention to enact wiretap legislation, the proposal for such legislation is still under discussion in the Cabinet.;The GOJ exceeded the marijuana eradication goal of 800 hectares set out in the Fiscal Year 1998 Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the USG. In addition, the GOJ agreed in the LOA to pay a share of the marijuana eradication teams' salaries, currently funded by the USG, beginning in June 2000. While the GOJ made some progress in implementing the recommendations contained in a 1997 assessment, security at Jamaica's ports remains a concern. The GOJ needs to take steps to improve security at its ports, including implementation of the remaining recommendations from the 1997 assessment. Additionally, the GOJ should consider providing the means to admit evidence obtained by ion scan technology in Jamaican courts. The GOJ has in place a national drug control strategy that covers both supply and demand reduction, the GOJ should add to its strategy specific goals and objectives and measures of effectiveness. Jamaica is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Laos;Laos is a major drug-producing country, it remains the world's third largest producer of illicit opium, behind Afghanistan and Burma. Although opium cultivation fell 16 percent in 1999, the USG estimates Laos' opium production for that year at 140 metric tons, identical to the 1998 estimate. Somewhat improved weather conditions increased estimated average yields, allowing total production to remain unchanged. Crop substitution project areas funded by the USG continued to show no commercial opium cultivation, only low level production sufficient for some local addict consumption.;Laos cooperates with the USG and the UNDCP on crop control/substitution projects designed to eliminate opium cultivation. The administration of Phongsali Province is providing enthusiastic support for the new USG-funded project there. The province administration assigned support personnel, held a meeting of district directors from throughout the province, and is expressing full support for the project to village headmen. In May 1999, the Government of Laos (GOL) agreed to a joint goal with the UNDCP to eliminate opium cultivation in Laos within six years, efforts to raise the estimated $80 million needed to reach this goal are underway. The highland farmers who grow opium now have no other viable option. Even if the farmers understood how to grow other crops and had the wherewithal to do so (neither of which is the case) they would lack accessible markets for their products. An ambitious project, requiring years of careful planning and implementation, is essential to create an alternative to opium. Such a plan would need alternative development, law enforcement, and demand reduction elements. Once developed, the plan would replace the previous GOL counter-drug master plan, which dates from 1993 and was also developed with UNDCP assistance.;Law enforcement efforts continue. USG-funded counter-drug offices law enforcement offices were opened in two more provinces. These offices, now in six provinces, along with other provincial police offices, reported 143 drug-related criminal cases in 1999, resulting in the arrests of 348 suspects (including 10 foreign nationals). Most arrests were of small-scale traffickers. These cases involved the seizure of 14.7 kilograms of heroin, 225.8 kilograms of opium, 806,700 methamphetamine tablets, and 2.2 metric tons of marijuana. Opium and heroin seizures fell significantly from record 1998 levels, as there was no case to match the 1998 destruction of a heroin laboratory. The number of arrests and quantity of opium seized are roughly equal to last year's totals, but the quantity of heroin seized has fallen significantly from the past two years. Methamphetamine seizures rose slightly. The quantity of heroin has dropped, in part, because none of the seizures was a very large shipment. Furthermore, it is believed traffickers have changed their routes and methods. For example, seizures in the United States of opium-filled parcels from Laos have jumped.;The GOL works very closely with its foreign assistance partners to combat drug trafficking and has registered steady progress this past year. The GOL also continues its important efforts to address the socio-economic problems underlying poppy cultivation. Corruption and inefficiency remain significant challenges to Lao counter-drug efforts. The GOL should continue to work with its foreign assistance partners to improve the administration of justice and to find alternatives to growing poppy.;Mexico;In 1999, the Government of Mexico (GOM) made substantial efforts to confront the major threats to public health and democratic institutions posed by transnational drug-trafficking organizations. Agreement on unprecedented, bilaterally negotiated Performance Measures of Effectiveness (PMEs) enhanced maritime cooperation, and performance improvements in the interdiction/eradication realm were encouraging. Corruption and judicial obstacles to the swift extradition of fugitives, however, remained impediments to a more productive counter-drug relationship.;A new $500 million public security plan, including establishment of the new Federal Preventative Police, complemented close bilateral counter-drug cooperation in 1999. That undertaking, which will take several years to implement fully, restructures several existing law enforcement agencies, and has already begun to improve police coverage and crime investigation. Steps are underway to acquire new technology, such as aerial radar platforms and upgraded telecommunications, and redistribute land, air, and maritime assets to improve coverage of priority areas. An interagency interdiction operation disrupted a major cartel's operations on the Yucatan Peninsula as part of a broad-based effort to reduce the flow of drugs into Mexico from Central and South America.;Marijuana eradication was up 39 percent over 1998 and net production down 19 percent for the year. Eradication of opium poppy, while down 10 percent from 1998, combined with reduced cultivation to yield a more than 25 percent drop in net opium gum production. The GOM made over 8,000 drug-related arrests, including: major cartel co-founder Juan Quintero Payan and key associates Oscar Benjamin Garcia Davila and Jaime Aguilar Gastelum. The Mexican Congress passed a new law codifying the use of seized/forfeited assets and creating a new office in the treasury ministry to manage these assets.;Mexico's achievements continued to be undermined by chronic institutional weaknesses, particularly drug-related corruption. The GOM has taken steps to strengthen internal controls, including expanding the mandate of the Attorney General's Office's (PGR) confidence control center and investigating numerous individual cases of suspected corruption. One such investigation implicated former Quintana Roo Governor Mario Villanueva, currently a fugitive from justice. President Zedillo has made combating corruption a national priority, but he acknowledged success will take time.;The USG and GOM cooperated closely on a wide range of law enforcement and drug abuse prevention efforts in 1999, guided by a National Drug Strategy agreed to in 1998 and accompanying PMEs. The first formal evaluation of the PMEs was completed in December 1999. Significant maritime seizures in the final seven months of year demonstrated enhanced U.S.Mexican cooperation, as did agreement by the two countries in November to establish a new interdiction working group under the binational High-Level Contact Group on Drug Control (HLCG). The USG provided technical and material support and training to Mexican agencies in furtherance of the GOM's justice sector modernization initiative, demand reduction programs and other efforts.;In 1999, the USG and GOM continued to work closely on fugitive issues. The GOM extradited 14 fugitives to the United States, including two Mexican national drug traffickers, one of whom was also sought for the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. In keeping with its historic 1996 decision to begin approving Mexican nationals for extradition in appropriate cases, the GOM appealed, with mixed results, several Mexican appellate court decisions barring extradition. The GOM has appealed to the Mexican Supreme Court a case which could resolve conflicting decisions by lower appellate courts and, thus, expedite delivery of fugitives in the future. Regrettably, Mexico has yet to extradite a major Mexican national drug trafficker.;The USG and GOM are committed at the highest levels to continued cooperation in efforts to defeat and dismantle heavily armed and well-financed trans-border drug trafficking organizations. In recent years, the two governments have constructed an unprecedented framework for coordination, a mechanism for evaluation, and fora for regular consultation on counter-drug issues. Through daily working-level interaction between counterpart agencies, policy-level discussions in the HLCG and other bilateral entities, and collaboration in multilateral groups, the two governments are finding increasingly productive ways to work together against the formidable threat drug trafficking poses to both nations.;Nigeria;Nigeria has failed to fully meet the criteria for cooperation with the United States on counter-drug matters and has not taken adequate steps on its own to meet the goals of the 1988 UN Drug Convention. U.S. vital national interests, however, require that Nigeria be certified so that the assistance that would otherwise be withheld remains available to support the continuing transition to democratic civilian rule and the increased efforts to improve cooperation on drug and other crime issues evident under the democratic government.;Nigeria remains the hub of African drug trafficking. Nigerian poly-crime organizations operate extensive global trafficking networks, dominate the Sub-Saharan drug markets, and account for a large part of the heroin imported into the United States. They also transport South American cocaine to Europe, Asia and elsewhere in Africa, especially South Africa, and export marijuana to Europe and West Africa.;The counter-drug efforts of the Government of Nigeria (GON) remain unfocused and lacking in material support. The new democratic government of President Obasanjo's strong public denunciation of drug trafficking and financial crimes is a welcome change from the high-level indifference that characterized most of Nigerian military rule. However, there have been no new actions or policies to bring about change.;The year 1999 saw the continuation of efforts limited largely to interdiction of low-level couriers and destruction of cannabis crops. Although the new government signaled its willingness to work with the USG on extradition issues, Nigeria did not extradite anyone in response to outstanding U.S. extradition requests. Well-drafted counter-drug legislation is already on the books, but remains largely un-enforced.;Nigerian law enforcement agencies did not significantly improve their counter-drug performance in 1999. There were no major trafficker prosecutions or arrests by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in 1999. Total heroin seizures increased, due primarily to a large seizure at Kano Airport. The NDLEA has signaled a willingness to increase its professional expertise, but institutional limitations make it difficult for Nigerian law enforcement officials to make progress against increasingly sophisticated criminals. Asset seizures did not become a useful counter-drug tool. Awareness of the local drug abuse problem is growing, but demand reduction efforts have been limited in scope and success.;Nigerian money launderers operate sophisticated global networks to repatriate illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, financial fraud, and other crimes. In 1995, the GON enacted a decree to combat illicit drug-derived money laundering, but enforcement has been uneven, yielding few seizures and no convictions. Nigeria is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Newly-elected President Obasanjo retired 143 military officers tainted by positions they held during the military government. Anti-corruption legislation has been proposed, but is stalled in the senate. Sporadic progress against corruption within the NDLEA contributed to its reputation as Nigeria's most professional law enforcement body. The NDLEA made regular arrests of individual drug couriers in 1999, but did not arrest or prosecute any major traffickers. Assets have been seized, but no forfeitures, which require convictions, have been made. The NDLEA chairman was briefly held in contempt for refusing to release several hundred thousand dollars worth of vehicles while their owner's case proceeds slowly through the legal system. The DEA received good cooperation from the NDLEA, but rampant corruption prevents sharing of sensitive information. NDLEA actions at airports, including breaking up a ring that involved airline and government employees, have made trafficking through airports more risky. There is an active cannabis eradication program, but figures are not available and supply easily meets demand. NDLEA has opened well-publicized anti-drug clubs at the universities, supplying them with anti-drug literature and videos.;Nigeria is one of the most important countries in Africa. What happens in Nigeria politically and economically will, to a large degree, determine whether there is stability and progress toward democracy and economic reform in West Africa. If Nigeria's ongoing transition fails, the result might easily be an implosion of government and the collapse of the economy, triggering a humanitarian disaster in Africa's most populous country (over 100 million people) and a destabilizing exodus of Nigerians to neighboring states. Such an upheaval could also disrupt the movement of high-quality Nigerian oil, which accounts for more than seven percent of total U.S. petroleum imports.;If, on the other hand, Nigeria's transition succeeds, it will be an example to all of Africa, and that success has the potential to promote economic growth and greater transparency in government. Nigeria could become an engine for growth in West Africa. A stable and democratic Nigeria will permit greater cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and the opportunity to reduce the impact of the Nigerian criminals who prey on the American people.;The military's acceptance of its appropriate role in a functioning democracy, and the new civilian government's ability to govern, will be critically impaired if Nigeria is deprived of the full range of USG support. Building a political consensus and meeting the challenges of a collapsing economy will also depend in no small part on outside assistance and expertise.;Denial of certification would block assistance the new democratically-elected government needs to meet these challenges, seriously damaging the prospects for success of stable, transparent democracy in Nigeria. U.S. vital national interests require providing humanitarian, economic and security assistance to Nigeria as well as counter-drug assistance from all sources. The risk of not doing so now would jeopardize not only Nigeria's fledgling democracy, but also Nigeria's attempts to reinvigorate its failing economy and support for democracy and peacekeeping throughout the region. Further, any new civilian government's ability to work with the USG on all issues, including counter-drug and other law enforcement, will depend on its access to multilateral lending and U.S. technical and economic assistance. The risks posed by the cutoff of assistance clearly outweigh the risks associated with GON's inadequate counter-drug performance over the past year.;Pakistan;In 1999, Pakistan made progress towards eliminating opium production by the year 2000 by reducing poppy cultivation by 48 percent. The poppy crop fell to a record-low of 1570 hectares. Cooperation on drug control with the USG has been excellent and the formation with DEA assistance of a Special Investigative Cell (SIC) within the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) was a major achievement. The overall record on drug interdiction was encouraging, with heroin seizures up 57 percent and several arrests of high-profile traffickers. The resolve of the Government of Pakistan (GOP) to prevent the reemergence of heroin/morphine laboratories remained firm. Pakistan extradited four drug fugitives to the United States and arrested six others, a significant improvement on previous years. Efforts to extend application of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) and the Anti-Narcotics Force Act (ANFA) to tribal areas in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) are continuing.;Pakistan's cabinet approved the drug control master plan in early 1999, but implementation has been slowed by a lack of funds. The GOP's counter-drug policies and cooperation with the USG were unaffected by the October 1999 coup. Pakistan is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Pakistani law enforcement tripled opium seizures from 3.65 to 11.50 metric tons, and increased heroin seizures by 57 percent, from 2.36 to 3.90 metric tons. Pakistan's illicit drug seizures were up significantly compared to the same period in 1998. The ANF is Pakistan's principal drug law enforcement agency. In 1999 the GOP began to examine ways to strengthen the institutional capacity and performance of the ANF. With DEA assistance, the ANF formed a vetted unit, or Special Investigative Cell, thereby improving intelligence collection and investigative capacity, and took steps toward recruiting new personnel. The ANF also arrested two politically powerful traffickers, one a prominent journalist and influential politician, the other a member of the then-ruling party, leading to the break-up of a gang of corrupt officials posted at Islamabad airport. All are awaiting trial.;1999 was a record setting year for ANF seizures of heroin and opium recovered in individual raids (a 213 percent increase in heroin seizures), with ANF Baluchistan making major contributions. Particularly noteworthy were a 760 kilogram heroin seizure in Kharan District of Baluchistan and a seizure in Turbat District of Baluchistan of 2951 kilograms of opium, 2580 kilograms of hashish and 111 kilograms of heroin. Apart from the ANF, the law enforcement agencies most actively engaged in drug seizures include the police, customs and the Frontier Corps.;In a major improvement over previous years, in 1999 the GOP arrested six drug fugitives and extradited four defendants to the United States. There are 15 pending extradition requests. In Baluchistan the ANF and Frontier Corps detected and challenged a number of Afghan convoys, resulting in firefights and seizures of 5.8 metric tons of opium, 1.1 tons of heroin, and seven vehicles. The killing of three traffickers and serious wounding of one ANF soldier may reflect the increased challenges posed by well-armed traffickers.;There were no convictions of major drug traffickers in 1999. Prosecution continued to drag out in the courts. However, the GOP has funded the establishment of five special drug courts to process drug cases more efficiently. Chemical controls are adequate, but there is still diversion of acetic anhydride from licit imports. Pakistan is not a major money laundering country, but, given the level of drug trafficking, smuggling, and official corruption, money laundering almost certainly occurs, mostly by means of unofficial, traditional money transfer facilities, known as "hawala.;The USG believes that Pakistan made an excellent contribution to international drug control efforts. We will support GOP efforts to target major heroin trafficking organizations and increase seizures of large shipments of opiates and precursor chemicals.;Panama;The Government of Panama (GOP) continues to demonstrate its willingness to combat transnational drug trafficking. The GOP seized significant amounts of illicit drugs in 1999, despite apparent changes in trafficking routes. The new Mireya Moscoso administration has demonstrated its commitment to combat drug trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational crimes. Immediately after taking office, the new administration set up an anti-corruption unit in the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Panama's law enforcement agencies continue to maintain excellent relations with their U.S. counterparts.;Panama is a major transshipment point for illicit drugs smuggled from Colombia. Cocaine is stockpiled in Panama prior to being repackaged for passage to the United States and Europe. Panama's location, largely unpatrolled coastlines, advanced infrastructure, underdeveloped judicial system, and well-developed financial services sector make it a crossroads for transnational crime, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, illicit arms sales and alien smuggling. According to USG statistics, GOP agencies seized 2,576 kilograms of cocaine, 1,558 kilograms of marijuana, 46 kilograms of heroin, and 600 liters of acetic anhydride, they also made 131 arrests for international drug-related offenses in 1999.;The GOP continued to implement its own national counter-drug plan, the "National Drug Strategy 1996-2001." Panama also made significant progress in implementing its comprehensive chemical control program.;The highest U.S. priorities in the coming year will be signing a full six part bilateral counter-drug maritime agreement, expanding anti-money laundering legislation, increasing efforts to control the Black Market Peso Exchange, and improving prosecutions of money launderers and drug traffickers. Other U.S. priorities in Panama include: supporting the GOP's efforts to build a highly-professional, interagency, counter-drug task force, developing the capabilities to control sea lanes, rivers, island and coastal regions, and the Canal area, and limiting cross-border criminal influence. With the seriousness and commitment of the new Moscoso administration, the USG is hopeful that there will be measurable progress in these areas in 2000.;Paraguay;Paraguay is a major drug-transit country for significant amounts of largely Bolivian cocaine and is also a major money-laundering center in Latin America (although it remains unclear what portion of money laundering can be attributed to drug trafficking).;USG experts estimate that between 15 and 30 metric tons of cocaine may transit Paraguay annually en route to Argentina, Brazil, the United States and Europe. Of this estimated amount, only 95 kilos of cocaine were seized in 1999, moreover, only 211 arrests of low-level marijuana and cocaine traffickers were effected, mostly prior to April 1999. Paraguay is a source country for high-quality marijuana. Although none of it enters the United States, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) seized record amounts of marijuana and eradicated 900 of the estimated 2,500 hectares of marijuana fields.;In July 1999, a new penal code was enacted that criminalizes conspiracy. This will allow the prosecution of those who benefit from criminal activity, but who are not the material perpetrators of the crime. However, extensive training of prosecutors and judges will be required before this new law can be fully implemented. One major Brazilian trafficker, arrested in 1997, was extradited to Brazil. The legislature approved the bilateral extradition treaty signed in 1998.;However, the GOP failed to accomplish the majority of counter-drug goals for 1999 in a manner sufficient for full certification. Since 1995, legislation has been pending to provide police and prosecutors with modern legal tools, such as use of informants, controlled deliveries, and undercover investigations. The Gonzalez Macchi administration submitted another draft of the legislation to the Paraguayan Congress, but it is the third administration to do so without the legislation being passed. The GOP did not investigate, arrest or prosecute any major drug traffickers, nor did it take sufficient measures to prevent or punish public corruption in general, or specifically with respect to drug trafficking. The GOP did not implement the 1996 money laundering law by arresting or prosecuting violators. Furthermore, the GOP did not provide operational funding or adequate resources for the anti-money laundering secretariat, SEPRELAD, to enable it to function as an independent organization (although in December 1999 a budget was approved for 2000). The GOP also failed to show progress toward development of an effective anti-drug and organized crime investigative and operational capability for the border regions.;Denial of certification would, however, cut off civilian and military assistance programs designed to strengthen Paraguay's democratic institutions and promote modern civil-military relations. Strengthening democracy in Paraguay is a U.S. vital national interest, and failure in this effort would affect negatively all other U.S. interests, including cooperation with respect to illicit drugs, terrorism, intellectual-property piracy, and environmental preservation. The events of 1999—which included defiance by then-President Cubas of the Supreme Court, the assassination of Vice President Argan˜a, the killing of student demonstrators, the impeachment and resignation of Cubas, drought, rural unrest, and the reported presence of fugitive former general and coup plotter Lino Oviedo—demonstrate the many challenges facing Paraguayan democracy. They also contributed to the GOP's unsatisfactory counter-drug performance. Denial of certification would undermine the U.S. ability to strengthen Paraguay's democratic institutions and would put at risk all other U.S. vital national interests.;The risks posed to the totality of U.S. interests (e.g., promotion of democracy and transnational crime cooperation) by a cutoff of bilateral assistance outweigh at this point the risks posed by the GOP's failure to cooperate fully with the USG, or to take fully adequate steps on its own, to achieve the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;In 2000, the GOP needs to translate its oft-stated political will into concrete action against major drug traffickers, money laundering, and official corruption.;People's Republic of China;The People's Republic of China (PRC) continued to take strong, effective steps to combat the use and trafficking of illicit drugs in 1999. Although preliminary figures indicate that seizures of heroin declined significantly from 1998's record level (possibly because of a decline in production in Burma), China's heroin seizures still accounted for the great majority of heroin seized in all of Asia. Seizures of methamphetamine and other am-phetamine-type stimulants soared, while those of precursor chemicals and opium remained at previous years' levels. China cooperated with the United States and other countries in providing pre-export notification of dual-use precursor chemicals. Government officials estimate that more than ten percent of China's 1.3 billion citizens viewed a nationwide anti-drug exhibition. DEA opened an office in Beijing. China continues to cooperate actively on operational issues with U.S. drug-enforcement officials. Domestically, China began a "Drug Free Communities" program to eliminate drug trafficking and abuse as well as drug-related crime.;During 1999, China cooperated with the UNDCP and regional states on a number of projects to reduce demand for illicit drugs. China also supported effective crop-substitution programs in Burma and Laos.;The United States and the PRC signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement that will enhance communications and accelerate the flow of counter-drug-related intelligence. China is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention as well as to the 1961 UN Single Convention and its 1972 Protocol, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.;U.S.-PRC cooperative law enforcement has advanced over the last two years, but China frequently does not respond to USG requests for information, and when it does, the responses often arrive too late to be of operational value. China has also failed to enforce vigorously and to strengthen anti-money-laundering legislation. For a number of reasons, China has also continued its non-engagement in the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering and did not pursue membership in the Financial Crimes Task Force.;Despite those shortcomings, the PRC has acted forcefully to stop the production, trafficking in, and use of illicit drugs within its borders and within the region, and is committed to achieving the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.;Peru;In 1999, the Government of Peru (GOP) made excellent progress in achieving its goal of eliminating illegal coca cultivation. Despite the rehabilitation of some previously abandoned coca fields, an additional 24 percent of coca cultivation was eliminated in 1999, for an overall reduction of 66 percent over the last four years. Contributing to this reduction was a 1999 manual coca cultivation eradication total of 15,000 hectares. The GOP counter-drug alternative development program, working through 103 local governments, almost 700 communities, and more than 15,000 farmers, significantly strengthened social and economic infrastructure in these areas and helped shift the economic balance in favor of licit activities. In January 2000, the GOP held a conference in Paris to promote alternative development support among major donor countries.;However, there is also increasing evidence that traffickers are processing cocaine hydrochloride within Peru's borders, setting up laboratories near the borders with Brazil, Colombia, and/or Bolivia, so that they can leave the country quickly without risk of interception. There were no interceptions or forcedowns of trafficker aircraft by the Peruvian Air Force (FAP) airbridge denial program in 1999—a tribute to the strong deterrent effect this program has had on the aerial transport of drugs. Recent seizures provide evidence that drug traffickers are using maritime shipment of cocaine from Callao and other Peruvian ports, riverine transport, and overland transport to move drugs out of Peru to evade aerial interdiction of trafficking aircraft. Private shipping companies, encouraged by the GOP, monitored sea cargo container activities during 1999, which led to the seizure by the Peruvian National Police of over five tons of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride bound for Europe.;Reliable reports and eradication campaigns indicate that Peru has an emerging opium poppy cultivation problem. Cultivation of opium poppy is illegal in Peru, whenever such plantings are identified, the GOP takes prompt action to destroy them. Reliable reports indicate that 55 kilograms of latex gum were seized in 1999, and 34,000 plants were eradicated.;In December, the Peruvian National Police arrested major drug trafficker Segundo Cachique Rivera. The Peruvian National Police chemical control unit conducted over 1,500 regulatory and criminal investigations of suspect businesses in 1999, making 58 arrests and seizing over 112 tons of controlled chemicals and two chemical companies. The GOP also passed new legislation to enhance the control of precursor chemicals.;Peru's significant reduction of coca under cultivation proves that its strategy is working. However, with higher prices being paid for coca, many farmers will be tempted to abandon licit crops. It is essential that manual eradication of illegal coca crops, counter-drug related alternative development, reinvigoration of the airbridge denial program, and land and maritime/riverine interdiction all continue as complementary programs. The GOP should also refine relevant laws, especially as they pertain to money laundering, asset seizure, and chemical controls.;Taiwan;The United States considers Taiwan a major transit point for drugs affecting the United States due to its geographic location, its role as a regional transportation/shipping hub, and the activities of organized crime groups. Taiwan in 1999 continued its aggressive domestic counter-drug program and its effective cooperation with the United States, through the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). Through October 1999, Taiwan authorities investigated 68,612 new drug cases, an increase of 48.9 percent over the same time period in 1998. The authorities seized more illicit drugs, primarily methamphetamine-type stimulants, in the first ten months of 1999 than all of 1998. Although indictments and convictions for drug-related offenses on Taiwan continued to fall in 1999, the decline reflects the first full year in which a law, allowing first-time addicts to participate in drug treatment programs in lieu of imprisonment, has been in force.;Taiwan cannot be a signatory to the 1988 Drug Convention because it is not a UN member. Taiwan authorities, nonetheless, have passed and implemented laws bringing Taiwan into compliance with the Convention's goals and objectives. Taiwan also continued to expand counter-drug cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies, through AIT.;Encouraged by AIT and DEA, Taiwan authorities passed two key drug laws to control both the manufacture and sale of phenylpropanolamine (PPA). The laws allow pre-export notification on shipments of PPA to other countries and establishes a new agency to monitor the production, use, and sale of drugs. Taiwan has continued to strengthen its efforts to stop drug trafficking and is addressing domestically and in conjunction with the international community the problem of money laundering.;Through AIT, Taiwan and U.S. law-enforcement agencies cooperated closely on investigations and joint operations concerning drug trafficking and related crimes. Taiwan authorities worked with the United States and other countries on anti-money laundering efforts. Taiwan is an active participant in the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering and the Egmont Group.;Thailand;At the time that the List of Major Drug Producing and Transiting Countries was prepared at the end of last year, information then available indicated that in excess of 1000 metric tons of opium was cultivated in Thailand. However, success with eradication programs during the current crop year seems to have reduced cultivation to well under that figure. Thailand remains a major drug transit country as a significant amount of heroin transits Thailand on its way to the United States. Indeed, Thai authorities recently made a number of large seizures of heroin headed for the United States.;Thailand continued its long tradition of cooperation with the United States and the international community in anti-drug programs. The Royal Thai Government (RTG) added to its leadership role in transnational crime issues by co-managing the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) with the USG in Bangkok. Thailand is one of the top three countries in the world in cooperating with the United States on extradition requests. Additional defendants arrested in 1994's operation "Tiger Trap" were extradited and extensive cooperative law enforcement programs continued to bear fruit.;Thailand has one of the most effective crop substitution and opium eradication operations in the world. 1999 poppy cultivation was down 38 percent from 1998 and opium production was down 62 percent. Eradication destroyed 50 percent of the crop leaving an estimated 6 metric tons remaining. Cultivated acreage has been slashed 91 percent since the onset of the eradication program in 1984. With DEA support, the Royal Thai Police (RTP) established the second in a series of specially-trained drug law enforcement units to target major trafficking groups. Overall, RTG efforts to target trafficking organizations have proceeded well, with numerous cases involving organizations with trafficking links opened in 1999.;More elements of the new Constitution came into force further strengthening rule of law and the judicial system, and providing a firm basis for further modernization and institutionalization of Thai society. Thai civil society is developing rapidly and a press with few restraints and the plethora of NGOs bring increasingly strong public attention to official corruption. A significant number of low and middle-ranked officers in the military and police were disciplined for corruption, although arrests for corruption continued to focus on lower-ranking officers and officials.;The RTG is close to deciding whether to accede to the 1988 UN Drug Convention. Passage of money laundering legislation was the last main requirement. Passage is expected in the March 2000 parliamentary session.;The USG considers Thailand an important ally in combating the production and flow of illicit drugs. Our two countries have been working together to fight production and trafficking of narcotics with great success for over three decades, and DEA considers its cooperation with Thailand to be one of its most successful overseas partnerships anywhere in the world.;Venezuela;By some estimates, over 100 metric tons of cocaine transit Venezuela annually en route to destinations in the United States and Europe. Venezuela is also a transit route for precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs in the Andean source countries, and its financial sector is a prime destination for laundering proceeds from Colombian cocaine trafficking organizations.;Venezuelan law enforcement agencies had increased success in drug interdiction in 1999, particularly on land and at major ports. Cocaine seizures rose to 13.1 metric tons from 8.6 metric tons in 1998. This improvement reflects both the increase in drug transshipment through the country in 1999 and the high level of tactical cooperation between Venezuelan and U.S. law enforcement agencies. The Government of Venezuela (GOV) also augmented its efforts to interdict chemical precursors, after establishing in 1998 a set of regulations to track the diversion of chemicals used in drug production. Working closely in conjunction with DEA, Venezuelan law enforcement officials seized over 110 tons of potassium permanganate, a prime chemical used in the production of cocaine, and signed an agreement with the Government of Colombia to exchange information on chemical precursor movements.;Corruption has traditionally hampered the effectiveness of Venezuela's law enforcement and judicial institutions. The GOV took concrete steps against corruption in 1999, initiating investigations of corrupt officials and overseeing the implementation of a new criminal code which has the potential to provide a more efficient, transparent system of justice.;To consolidate these important advances, the GOV should take certain measures to improve its performance, specifically: pass needed anti-organized crime legislation, reenter negotiations with the USG on a comprehensive maritime agreement, take the necessary steps to permit the extradition of Venezuelan nationals accused of drug-related crimes or organized crime activity, and continue to enhance and refine multilateral counter-drug interdiction cooperation.;Vietnam;As a national priority in Vietnam, the fight against illicit drugs is second only to poverty reduction. In 1999 Vietnam fought on two fronts: against the production and use of drugs as well as against cross-border trafficking of drugs. Vietnam, with 2,100 hectares under poppy cultivation and a potential of 11 metric tons of opium production, intensified efforts to eradicate poppy crops. Authorities also successfully eradicated 860 of an estimated total of 1,000 hectares used for cannabis cultivation in 1999.;The Government of Vietnam (GOV) instituted an augmented prevention campaign to reduce domestic drug use and abuse. Also in 1999 Vietnam stiffened law-enforcement campaigns against drug traffickers and toughened prosecution to achieve a record number of arrests and convictions. Authorities prosecuted 3,310 drug-related cases involving 4,952 defendants. Of cases brought to trial, 35 received a death sentence and 21 were sentenced to life imprisonment. A high-profile anti-corruption campaign was implemented and included public trials of high-ranking government and party officials involved in illicit drug and other smuggling.;Due, in part, to its location so close to the "Golden Triangle," Vietnam is a major transit point for opium and heroin. To address this problem, the GOV set up special task force units to combat drug trafficking along the borders, and police, customs and border forces arrested 19,010 drug criminals, an increase in arrests of 31 percent over last year. Drug interdictions increased by 32 percent, with seizures of 51.8 kilograms of heroin, 314 kilograms of opium, and 369 kilograms of cannabis. In its first year of operation (September 1998-September 1999), the marine police force began patrols to detect drug trafficking. Vietnam also tightened oversight and control of precursor chemicals, transferring responsibility for monitoring to the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Public Health, and Department of Customs, and set up a Precursor Chemical Control Force in the Ministry of Health.;In 1999 GOV began work on preparing draft counter-drug legislation to modernize organized-crime statutes and techniques, enhance law-enforcement efforts, and strengthen compliance with the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to which Vietnam is a party. Vietnam is negotiating counter-drug agreements with China and several EU countries, has cooperated with Interpol, and has worked closely with U.S. law-enforcement agencies. In April 1999 the Vietnamese Police joined the ASEANOPOL Criminal Information System. UNDCP is assisting Vietnam revise its Master Plan against drugs and craft its new counter-drug legislation. Vietnam supports UNDCP projects targeting demand reduction, crop substitution and suppression of drug trafficking.;The United States and Vietnam have not yet concluded a counter-drug agreement. The GOV has not fully eradicated poppy crops, and farmers reverted to poppy cultivation in some high-poverty rural areas, bringing an additional 645 hectares under cultivation in 1999 and increasing the total to 2,100 hectares devoted to poppy crops. Vietnam's National Assembly approved penal code revisions that criminalize money laundering for the first time. The provisions will take effect on July 1, 2000. Vietnam is working with the World Bank to develop a money-laundering section in draft banking legislation.;Despite some notable shortcomings, Vietnam has made a vigorous effort to combat drug production and trafficking. There is no question that the GOV at the highest levels fully realizes the threat drugs present to their own people and society and is doing everything possible to counter the availability and use of illicit drugs.</td></tr>

Section 211 of the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (Title II of Public Law 106-200) (CBTPA), which amends section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)), provides that certain preferential tariff treatment may be provided to eligible articles that are the product of any country that the President designates as a "CBTPA beneficiary country" pursuant to section 213(b)(5)(B) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(5)(B)), provided that the President determines that the country has satisfied the requirements of section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(4)(A)(ii)) relating to the implementation of procedures and requirements similar to those in chapter 5 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).;2. Section 211 of the CBTPA, which amends section 213(b) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)), provides that eligible textile and apparel articles of a designated CBTPA beneficiary country shall enter the United States free of duty and free of quantitative limitations, provided that the President determines that the country has satisfied the requirements of section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the CBERA relating to the implementation of procedures and requirements similar to those in chapter 5 of the NAFTA.;3. Section 212 of the CBTPA, which amends section 213(a) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(a)), provides duty-free treatment for certain liqueurs and spirituous beverages produced in Canada from rum that originates in a designated beneficiary country or the Virgin Islands of the United States.;4. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided under the CBTPA, it is necessary to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), thereby incorporating the substance of the relevant provisions of the CBTPA.;5. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;6. I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to perform the functions specified in section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the CBERA and certain functions under section 604 of the 1974 Act.;Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, sections 211 and 212 of the CBTPA, section 213 of the CBERA, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide for the preferential treatment provided for in section 213 of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703), as amended by the CBTPA, the HTS is modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation.;(2) The following countries are designated as CBTPA beneficiary countries pursuant to section 213(b)(5)(B) of the CBERA;Antigua and Barbuda;Aruba;Bahamas;Barbados;Belize;Costa Rica;Dominica;Dominican Republic;El Salvador;Grenada;Guatemala;Guyana;Haiti;Honduras;Jamaica;Montserrat;Netherlands Antilles;Nicaragua;Panama;St. Kitts and Nevis;Saint Lucia;Saint Vincent and the Grenadines;Trinidad and Tobago;British Virgin Islands;(3) The USTR is authorized to determine whether each designated beneficiary country has satisfied the requirements of section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the CBERA relating to the implementation of procedures and requirements similar in all material respects to the relevant procedures and requirements under chapter 5 of the NAFTA. To implement such determination or determinations, the USTR is authorized to exercise the authority provided to the President under section 604 of the 1974 Act to embody modifications and technical or conforming changes in the HTS. The determination or determinations of the USTR under this paragraph shall be set forth in a notice or notices that the USTR shall cause to be published in the Federal Register. Such notice or notices shall modify general note 17 of the HTS by listing the countries that satisfy the requirements of section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the CBERA.;(4) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;(5) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this proclamation, except that the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this proclamation, as further modified by any notice to be published in the Federal Register as described in paragraph 3 of this proclamation, shall be effective on the date announced by the USTR in such notice.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-fifth.;WILLIAM J.

Clinton: Statement on the Resignation of Barry R. McCaffrey as Director of National Drug Control Policy</td><td class="c6">October 16, 2000</td><td class="c7">General Barry McCaffrey, USA (Ret.), has informed me that he will step down in January as Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank and commend him for his extraordinary work in meeting one of our Nation's most pressing challenges. General McCaffrey has brought to his post the same professionalism, dedication, and leadership that have exemplified his 40 years of steadfast service to our Nation.;In accepting this post in 1996, General McCaffrey retired from the United States Army as its youngest and most decorated four-star general. He had served and commanded with honor from West Point to the Dominican Republic to Vietnam to the Persian Gulf and, finally, as Commander in Chief, Southern Command. He was twice awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, our Nation's second-highest military honor.;In the nearly 5 years General McCaffrey has led our war on drugs, we have made significant progress both at home and abroad. We have dramatically increased our counter-drug spending and launched a $1 billion public-private media campaign to educate young people about the dangers of drug use. Our efforts are paying off. Adolescent drug use in the United States dropped 21 percent in the past 2 years alone, and drug-related murders are at their lowest level in a decade. And working with our international partners, we have helped to significantly reduce coca cultivation in Latin America and helped to build a level drug-free playing field for the world's Olympians.;Our Nation and my administration have benefited greatly from General McCaffrey's outstanding dedication, enterprise, and leadership. He has been a valued member of my Cabinet, and I am grateful for his sound counsel. I am confident that he will continue to serve our Nation with honor and distinction in the years ahead. The First Lady and I wish him and his wife, Jill, all the best in their new endeavors.</td></tr>

Clinton: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Certification of Major Illicit Drug Producing and Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">November 1, 2000</td><td class="c7">Dear;In accordance with the provisions of section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the "Foreign Assistance Act"), I have determined that the following are major illicit drug producing or major drug-transit countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam. This year I have removed Hong Kong and Taiwan from the list of major illicit drug producing or major drug-transit countries (the "Majors List").;The Majors List, as required by section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act, applies to "countries." The term "countries" is interpreted broadly to include certain entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that would lead to a decision to place them on the list and subsequently to determine eligibility or certification. Therefore, in the past, the Majors List has included certain entities that are not sovereign states.;I wish to make clear that a country's presence on the list of major drug-transit countries is not necessarily an adverse reflection on its counterdrug efforts or on the level of its cooperation with the United States. Among the reasons that major drug-transit countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit through a country, in many cases despite the most assiduous enforcement measures.;I also wish to note my concern over the rising imports of foreign-origin, illegal synthetic drugs into the United States, especially MDMA ("Ecstasy") from Europe. We are still collecting information on this problem, and it is a trend that bears watching closely in future years.;Changes to the List;Removal of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been considered a major drug-transit country since 1987, when the first Majors List was prepared. Its proximity to the Golden Triangle opium cultivation countries of Thailand, Laos, and Burma, along with its highly developed air and sea transport infrastructure, made it a logical transit point for trafficking organizations moving Southeast Asian heroin to the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere.;Over the past few years, however, Hong Kong's role as a transit point for U.S.-bound drugs has declined markedly, due to several factors. Stringent enforcement measures and extradition agreements with various countries, including the United States, and the risk of having narcotics shipments seized, have become effective deterrents to shipping drugs through Hong Kong. At the same time, drug flows from China through Hong Kong have diminished significantly. As China continues to develop its coastal cargo-handling facilities and expands port operations in the south, there is less incentive for drug traffickers to re-export and transship cargo through Hong Kong.;Seizure rates in both the United States and Hong Kong suggest that trafficking organizations are no longer using Hong Kong as a transit point for U.S.-destined heroin. Since 1996, there have been no significant seizures in the United States of heroin linked with Hong Kong. Similarly, the Hong Kong authorities report that in the past two years they have made no large seizures locally of heroin destined for the United States. Consequently, I am removing Hong Kong from the Majors List and downgrading it to a country of concern. If in the future there is evidence of drug flows through Hong Kong that significantly affect the United States, Hong Kong will again be placed on the Majors List.;Removal of Taiwan. In the early 1990s, Taiwan became a transit point for Asian drug trafficking organizations moving heroin to the Western Hemisphere. The largest U.S. heroin seizure on record is the nearly half-ton of heroin that U.S. authorities discovered in Hayward, California in 1991. The drugs, which originated in China, had transited Taiwan en route to the United States. Given Taiwan's role in that transshipment and evidence of Taiwan-related drug flows to the United States at that time, I added Taiwan to the Majors List in 1995.;Taiwan's role as transit point for drugs destined for the United States, however, has changed radically in the past few years. More stringent law enforcement procedures, together with improved customs inspection and surveillance methods, have all but cut off serious flows of heroin from Taiwan to the United States. At the same time, the opening of major container ports in southern China has diminished Taiwan's importance for the drug trade.;Since Taiwan was designated a major drugtransit country, there have been no seizures in the United States of heroin that transited Taiwan, nor have Taiwan authorities identified any important drug shipments destined for the United States. Therefore, I am removing Taiwan from the Majors List and downgrading it to a country of concern. If in the future we detect any drug flows through Taiwan that significantly affect the United States, Taiwan will again be placed on the Majors List.;Countries/Entities and Regions of Concern;In addition to Hong Kong and Taiwan, the following are countries or regions of concern;Belize. Belize was removed from the list of major drug-transit countries in 1999 because there was clear evidence that the drug trade was not currently using it as a transit point for drugs moving to the United States. If, at a future date, there is reliable information that U.S.bound drugs are again moving through Belize in significant quantities, it will again be placed on the Majors List.;Central America. Central America's position as a land bridge between South America and Mexico, together with its thousands of miles of coastline, several container-handling ports, the Pan-American Highway, and limited law enforcement capability make the entire region a natural conduit and transshipment area for illicit drugs bound for Mexico and the United States. Currently, only Guatemala and Panama have been designated major drug-transit countries, since there is clear evidence that drug trafficking organizations use their territory to move significant quantities of illegal drugs to the United States. The same is not yet true of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, or Nicaragua.;Although there is no question that varying quantities of drugs do flow through these countries en route to the United States, the bulk of the traffic has shifted away from land routes. Stringent law enforcement and interdiction measures on land have forced trafficking organizations to move drugs along sea routes. In the event that there is evidence that drugs transiting these countries are having a significant effect on the United States, they will be added to the Majors List.;Iran. While Iran was once a traditional opium-producing country, the Government of Iran appears to have been successful in eradicating significant illicit opium poppy cultivation. The latest U.S. survey of the country revealed no detectable poppy cultivation in the traditional growing areas. Although one cannot rule out some cultivation in remote parts of the country, it is unlikely that it would be sufficient to meet the threshold definition of a major illicit drug producing country under section 481(e)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act.;Important quantities of opiates reportedly continue to transit Iran en route to Europe, but I have no evidence that these drugs significantly affect the United States, a requirement for designation as a major drug-transit country under section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act. Moreover, Iran has taken extensive measures to thwart the use of its territory by drug traffickers, seizing well above 200 metric tons of drugs annually in recent years.;Malaysia. Malaysia was removed from the Majors List two years ago because there was no evidence that drugs transiting the country were reaching the United States in significant quantities. That situation has not changed since that time.;Eastern Caribbean. The Leeward and Windward Islands, together with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, constitute a broad geographical area through which U.S.-bound drugs pass en route from Latin America. In the right circumstances, any country in the region could become a major drug-transit country. There is no evidence at this time, however, that any of these Eastern Caribbean nations is a major drug-transit country under the definition in section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act. The information available, however, indicates that drugs moving through the area are overwhelmingly destined for Europe. We are, therefore, keeping the region under observation. Relevant countries will be added to the Majors List, should conditions warrant.;Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. I am concerned by the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin that moves through Turkey and neighboring countries to Western Europe along the Balkan Route. There is no clear evidence, however, that this heroin significantly affects the United States, as required for a country to be designated a major drug-transit country. In the event that it is determined that heroin transiting Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, the relevant countries will be added to the Majors List.;Syria and Lebanon. I removed Syria and Lebanon from the list of major illicit drug producers two years ago after we determined that there was no significant opium poppy cultivation in Lebanon's Biqa Valley. Recent surveys have confirmed that there has been no detectable replanting of opium poppy, and we have no evidence that drugs transiting these countries significantly affect the United States. We continue, however, to keep the area under observation.;North Korea. We have been unable to confirm reports that significant quantities of opium poppy may be under cultivation in North Korea or that heroin originating in the country may be entering the international drug trade. We continue, however, to monitor the situation. If there is evidence that there is indeed poppy cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more in North Korea or that North Korea is a transit point for drugs significantly affecting the United States, it will be added to the Majors List.;Cuba. Cuba's geographical position, straddling one of the principal Caribbean trafficking routes to the United States, makes it a logical candidate for consideration for the Majors List. While there have been some reports that trafficking syndicates use Cuban land territory for moving drugs, we have yet to receive any confirmation that this traffic carries significant quantities of cocaine or heroin to the United States. Moreover, in 2000, much of the suspect air traffic that previously crossed Cuban airspace has now shifted away to Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic).;I will continue to keep Cuba under careful observation for any changes in current transit patterns. If there is evidence of significant quantities of drugs transiting Cuba to the United States, Cuba will be added Cuba to the Majors List.;Central Asia. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan are traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. However, we have not found evidence of significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, the relevant countries will be added to the Majors List.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are important cannabis producers, I have not included them on this list since in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States. I have determined that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Sincerely;WILLIAM J. CLINTON</td></tr>

Born into slavery, Frederick Douglass became a renowned international spokesman for liberty, the abolition of slavery, and social reform. Throughout his life, he was a noted publisher of several periodicals and papers in which he discussed the political and social disenfranchisement of Americans of African ancestry. As an American truly committed to the Nation's progress toward the attainment of liberty and justice for all, Frederick Douglass recruited African-Americans for the Union Army during the Civil War, two of his sons served in the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, which was solely comprised of African-Americans. Moreover, Frederick Douglass served as the president of the Freedmen's National Bank, the U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia, and in several diplomatic positions in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Because of his unyielding faith in and his commitment to the fundamental democratic principles of our Nation, I am pleased to approve this legislation honoring one of the Nation's great citizens.</td></tr>

Clinton: Remarks on Presenting the Presidential Citizens Medal</td><td class="c6">January 8, 2001</td><td class="c7">Thank you, and good afternoon. I would like to thank all of you for coming and welcome you to the White House, but especially the Members of Congress who either are or have been here. Senator Cleland, welcome, sir, Senator Kennedy, Representative Gilman—Mr. Chairman Gilman, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, Representative Sununu. And Mr. Justice Souter, we're delighted to see you here today. We thank you for coming.;I won't have many more chances to do this, so I'd also like to thank the United States Marine Band for being here and for all their work. Yesterday Hillary and Chelsea and I went to Foundry Methodist Church, which has been our home church since we've been in Washington, and they asked me to speak on reflections and anticipations. And I said I had many anticipations. I anticipated, for example, that my religious bearing would be severely tested when I returned to commercial air travel. [ Laughter ] And I further anticipated that whenever I walked into a large room for the next 6 months, I would be lost because the Marine Band wouldn't be there to play a song anymore. [ Laughter ] So I thank them so much for all they've done this last 8 years.;One of the greatest honors I have had as President has been the opportunity to recognize and to honor, on behalf of the American people, the rich and diverse accomplishments of our fellow citizens. This ceremony marks the last time I will honor such a remarkable group at the White House, and I am profoundly grateful for this opportunity.;More than two centuries ago, our Founders staked their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor on a revolutionary proposition, that people of competing ideas but common ideals could form a more perfect Union, a democracy built solely on the strength of its citizens. They felt it essential that America honor both the individual and the idea that a free people can accomplish their greatest work only by doing so together, for our common good.;Today we honor citizens whose individual contributions to the common good embody this ideal in its purest essence. We honor them with the President's Citizens Medal. Among our Nation's highest civilian honors, the Citizens Medal is a symbol of our gratitude as a people for those who have, in particular, performed exemplary deeds of service to others.;Now, let me say a few words about each of those who we honor, and I will ask my military aide to present me with a medal, and then I will present the medals.;Every baseball fan knows Hank Aaron holds more records than any other single ballplayer. Indeed, one of the truly great experiences of my Presidency was going to Atlanta for the 25th anniversary of the night Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's home run record. But his courage and dignity have left a lasting mark on far more than baseball.;We honor him today not only for the power of his swing but for the power of his spirit, for breaking down barriers not just on the baseball field or in the front office but also within America's heart. In the spotlight and under pressure, he always answered bigotry and brutality with poise and purpose.;In chasing his dream, Hank Aaron gave others the inspiration to chase their own. And after he left baseball, he and his wonderful wife, Billye, have done what they could to give young people more tools to win their own chase. Hank Aaron, you are an American hero, and we salute you for your life.;[ At this point, the President presented the medal. ];Because he could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, Muhammad Ali became the first boxer in history to capture the heavyweight title three separate times. Along the way, he captured the world's imagination and its heart. Outside the ring, Muhammad Ali has dedicated his life to working for children, feeding the hungry, supporting his faith, and standing up for racial equality. He has always fought for a just and more humane world, breaking down barriers here in America and around the world.;There are no telling how many tens of millions of people had their hearts swell with pride and their eyes swell with tears in 1996 when Muhammad Ali lit the Olympic torch, because we know, now and forever, he is the greatest.;[ The President presented the medal. ];As a civics teacher fresh out of college, Juan Andrade showed up for the first day of class eager to teach his students the fundamentals of American democracy. Two days later, he was under arrest. What was his terrible crime? He was teaching his students in his native tongue, Spanish, which was at the time a violation of Texas law.;That early injustice helped to spark Juan's life-long crusade for Hispanic-American civil rights, including the founding of the United States Hispanic Leadership Institute and nearly 1,000 registration drives that have enfranchised over one million new voters. Today we honor Juan Andrade for his courage, his commitment to both democracy and diversity, and for giving so many more Americans a voice in their own destiny.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Ruby Bridges was born in 1954, the year the Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education. Six years later, when she entered the first grade, the schools in her hometown of New Orleans were still separate and unequal. Ruby was chosen to integrate William Frantz Public School, singlehandedly. So when mobs gathered and shouted around this 6-year-old girl, she knelt and prayed. She had two U.S. marshalls ahead of her and two behind, but "prayer," she later said, "was my protection.;Today, in lectures and books, Ruby is telling younger generations her story of strength and faith. And through the Ruby Bridges Foundation, she is helping schools to establish diversity programs, to achieve without the struggle and pain what she did four and a half decades ago.;Today we pay tribute to the courage of a little girl and to the commitment of a lifetime.;[ The President presented the medal. ];One of Ron Brown's favorite Bible passages came from the 40th chapter of Isaiah, "Those who wait upon the Lord shall have their strength renewed, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run, and not grow weary, they shall walk, and not faint.;Well, Ron walked, ran, and soared through life and, I can personally testify, never grew weary. As the chairman of my party, he inspired people to believe in our democratic system and to get involved. As Secretary of Commerce, he opened up new markets at home and abroad, so that people throughout the world and here in America might, through work, have better lives for their families.;His legacy still burns brightly, not only in the hearts of those who knew him but also in the work of his daughter, Tracey, who wrote a wonderful biography of her father, the work of his son, Michael, who runs the Ron Brown Foundation, and the living testimony of all the young people who even now walk through doors he opened and cross bridges he built.;We honor his memory today and, Alma, I am glad you could be with us to share the moment.;[ The President presented the medal to Alma Brown, Ron Brown's widow. ];For nearly 20 years, Don Cameron has served as the executive director of the National Education Association. But his career began long before that, as a Michigan junior high school teacher in the early sixties. His starting salary was a handsome $5,100 a year, hardly enough to support a family. So while teaching, he worked odd jobs, pumping gas, selling hardware, driving a truck, even digging graves—all for the love of teaching. Let no one say this man was not deadly serious about his job. [ Laughter ];His enthusiasm has never wavered. During his remarkable tenure, the National Education Association grew by more than a million members, it nearly doubled in size. He has always fought for quality schools, smaller classes, making sure that teachers are meeting high professional standards, and in turn, are treated as the professionals they are. Our schools are stronger and our children's future brighter because of his decades of dedicated leadership.;Thank you, Don Cameron.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When Pope John the 23d urged Catholics to engage in the world and address the needs of the poor, Sister Carol Coston, an Adrian Dominican nun, answered the call. She left the security of her convent to live and work in a public housing project. Then she helped to create Network, a national Catholic lobby that has mobilized thousands of nuns and lay people to fight for social progress in South Africa, for women's rights, and for economic justice. She helped to win passage of the Community Reinvestment Act, which has led to billions of dollars in investment in our inner cities—I am proud to say, Sister, 95 percent of it in the last 8 years.;And she founded Partners for the Common Good, a fund that invests in housing and entrepreneurship in low income neighborhoods. For your work as an agent of change, rooted in the values of your faith, Sister Carol, a grateful nation honors you today.;[ The President presented the medal. ];As a young Government lawyer during World War II, Archibald Cox helped to get labor unions and corporations to stop fighting each other—a work that's still going on today—and to start working together for an allied victory. That same steely resolve and sense of high purpose have marked his entire astonishing career. Fighting for labor rights in the fifties, civil rights in the sixties, and during Watergate, rising that fateful night to defend our Constitution, he has come to embody the highest ideals of integrity and courage in public life.;Archibald Cox, every American, whether he or she knows your name or not, owes you a profound debt of thanks for a lifetime of your service to your country and its Constitution.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Just as Lewis and Clark set forth to explore a continent shrouded in mysterious possibility, Charles DeLisi pioneered the exploration of a modern day frontier, the human genome. As an administrator and researcher in the Department of Energy in the mid-1980's, he worked in close partnership with Senator Pete Domenici, along with others who supported his efforts to marshal Federal resources and secure funding for this groundbreaking research.;Charles DeLisi's imagination and determination helped to ignite the revolution in sequencing that would ultimately unravel the code of human life itself. Thanks to Charles DeLisi's vision and leadership, in the year 2000 we announced the complete sequencing of the human genome. And researchers are now closer than ever to finding therapies and cures for ailments once thought untreatable.;At once scientist, entrepreneur, and teacher, Charles DeLisi is also, in the truest sense, a humanitarian, a man whose life work has been life itself. We honor you today, sir, along with the Members of the United States Congress, including your friend, Senator Domenici, who had the vision to support you when you began, before we could see this great turn in the road. Thank you.;[ The President presented the medal. ];The spread of civil and human rights throughout America and across the globe has been one of the great dramas and triumphs of the last half century. Jack Greenberg has been at the center of the action. As a young lawyer, he helped Thurgood Marshall argue Brown v. Board of Education before the Supreme Court. As head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund for 23 years, he, himself, argued dozens of key racial discrimination cases before the high court. Through his early involvement with organizations such as Asia Watch, he aided the expansion of human rights around the world.;Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that to truly live, one must share the action and passion of one's time. If that remains the standard, Jack Greenberg has truly lived and, in the process, has lifted the lives of countless others.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When David Ho was a boy, he used puppets to act out stories about heroes who used supernatural powers to defend the weak. Everyone knew young David was uncommonly bright, but few could have imagined that one day he would harness the unimagined powers of science to defend patients whose immune systems were fatally weakened by AIDS. By demonstrating the ways HIV attacks the human body, he fundamentally changed the way we understand and treat this devastating disease. His groundbreaking work, using protease inhibitors, in combination with standard therapies, has offered a longer life to countless people living with AIDS.;And so we thank you, David Ho, for giving us new hope that AIDS can be treated and one day cured and for reminding us that a child's dream can lead to miracles for others.;[ The President presented the medal. ];In 1988 the students at Gallaudet University rose up to demand a university president who was like them, deaf or hard of hearing. Gallaudet, the only university in the world designed entirely for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, never had had a deaf president. That is, not until I. King Jordan. His appointment was not only a triumph for the students of Gallaudet but a historic breakthrough for all people with disabilities and a powerful reminder for the rest of our Nation that deaf people like I. King Jordan can excel and lead as well as any other Americans. Moved by his example and the efforts of the entire disability community, Congress soon passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, the most important civil rights legislation in the last quarter century.;I. King Jordan has been a great teacher, a great university president, a great inspiration to millions of people around the world. Along the way, he's found time to be a not inconsiderable athlete, I might add, running great distances at more than reasonable speeds. [ Laughter ] And he has been a very good friend to this President for the last 8 years.;Thank you, President Jordan, for your example and your leadership.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Franklin Roosevelt once said, "We must scrupulously guard the civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens, whatever their background.;In the decades since, America has had few guardians of liberty more scrupulous or staunch than Anthony Lewis. Reporter, columnist, professor, author, Tony Lewis in every role has been a clear and courageous voice for the values at the core of our Constitution.;In books like "Gideon's Trumpet," he has deepened our understanding of freedom of speech and our continuing battle for civil rights. Twice, his reporting has won the Pulitzer Prize. Perhaps even more important, throughout a lifetime, all his writings, including his column, have shown a commitment and a passion with a civil tone and a careful, thoughtful reasoning that have been more powerful than the forces of brute power and injustice.;Thank you, Tony Lewis, for the values you have espoused, for the way you have espoused them, and for never growing weary.;[ The President presented the medal. ];It was 1944, wartime, and African-American soldiers were fighting and dying to protect freedom around the world. Unfortunately, African-Americans were also battling an insidious enemy here at home, Jim Crow. It was then that a young mother named Irene Morgan took up that fight with dignity and determination. On her way to a doctor's appointment, she refused to give up her seat on a segregated Greyhound bus and appealed her subsequent arrest all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court's 1946 ruling banning segregation on interstate transportation was an early victory in the struggle for civil rights. It signaled the beginning of the end for Jim Crow.;Over all the decades since, Irene Morgan has never asked for accolades, but today we honor her. We acknowledge our debt to her quiet and brave fight for freedom. And we acknowledge the fact that she was there before just about anybody else, and in spite of that, she still looks like a beautiful, young woman. Irene Morgan.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When Constance Baker Motley joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, she set out to do nothing less than remake American law. Along the way, she herself made history. A key strategist in the civil rights movement, sheargued nine winning cases before the Supreme Court. She went on to become the first African-American woman elected to the New York State Senate, the first woman and the first African-American to be borough president of Manhattan, the first African-American woman to be named a Federal court judge.;Once she said she sought to, "prove in everything I do that blacks and women are as capable as anyone." As advocate, lawyer, public servant, and judge, she has been far more than capable, she has been superb. And Constance Baker Motley, we are all in your debt.;[ The President presented the medal. ];In the 1960's, Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias grew outraged at the poor quality of pediatric health care in her native Puerto Rico, so she created the island's first center for newborn babies at the University of Puerto Rico Medical Center and cut the hospital's infant death rate in half. Ever since, in New York, in California, all across America, Dr. Rodriguez-Trias has been working for better patient care, for better treatment and prevention of AIDS, for women's health rights.;For fighting the good fight and saving countless lives, mostly among poor people that are too often forgotten by others, I am proud to present this medal to Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When Edward Roybal joined the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934, he didn't know he was embarking on a lifetime of service to his country, but it turned out that way. In World War II, he served in the Army, in the 1950's, on the Los Angeles city council. In 1962 he became the first Hispanic elected to Congress from California in almost a century, paving the way for a whole generation of Latino lawmakers. During his 30 years in Congress, he championed veterans, the elderly, the mentally ill, education, health care, and minority rights.;For a lifetime of work that has improved the lives of millions and for lighting the path for other Latino office holders, we honor today Edward Roybal. He is unable to join us, but it is a particular pleasure for me to present this award to his daughter, now a Member of the United States Congress, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Eight years ago, in a very troubled time for the American economy, I asked Bob Rubin to head my economic team and to establish for the first time a National Economic Council in the White House and involving all the economic agencies of the Government. I did it not because he had been immensely successful in making money and knew a lot about the economy but because he also understood the very real impact decisions in Washington have on the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Americans all across this Nation.;As my National Economic Adviser and later as a superb Secretary of the Treasury, Bob balanced a commitment to fiscal prudence and social progress. He understood that good economics and a generous progressive social policy could go hand in hand. He helped to balance the Nation's books and to balance the Nation's priorities. And it is no accident that his leadership in economic policy accompanied not only the longest economic expansion in history but, last year, the biggest drop in child poverty in 34 years, the biggest increase in personal income among the lowest 20 percent of working Americans in a very long time, and a general growth in the equality and harmony we all seek from all our people.;He also never let me forget our special responsibilities to the inner cities of America, which is why I mentioned earlier that even though the Community Reinvestment Act has been on the books for over 20 years, 95 percent of all the investment occurred during the last 8 years.;Thank you, Bob Rubin, for helping make America a better place.;[ The President presented the medal. ];As a combat platoon leader in the Korean war, Warren Rudman never worried about the race or background of the men with whom he fought. As a United States Senator, he never let his party affiliation keep him from speaking his mind or building alliances to fight the great legislative battles. He fought to strengthen and modernize our national defense and to put our fiscal house in order. As a private citizen, he has continued to champion those causes with bipartisan zeal. As cofounder of the Concord Coalition and as the leader of my Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, he has repeatedly, during these 8 years of my Presidency, undertaken difficult, thankless, inherently controversial tasks with an honesty and candor that showed a support for our Nation and a willingness to call them as he saw them.;For his wise counsel, and his faithful service to our Nation, I am grateful and proud to present Senator Warren Rudman with the Citizens Medal.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Soon after graduating from law school, Charles Ruff volunteered to go to Liberia to teach law. There he contracted an illness that left him in a wheelchair for life. But this obstacle, nor any other, could ever keep him from doing good. He went on to serve in the Justice Department as United States Attorney and the chief lawyer for the District of Columbia, the town he loved so well. I chose him as my White House Counsel because of his unmatched ability as a legal advocate and his even deeper devotion to the Constitution and the rule of law. Not long ago he agreed to lead the Fair Labor Association to help end sweatshops and improve the lives of the world's poorest people.;A few weeks ago, Chuck Ruff left our lives, far too soon. But his determined spirit continues to inspire us and to call on us to do more, to do right, to do good. We at the White House loved him very much, but so did countless others, far beyond the walls of this hallowed place. His secretary of 21 years, Ora Theard, will accept the medal in his memory. And we thank him for the memories.;[ The President presented the medal. ];As a young man, Arthur Schneier fled his homeland and survived the Holocaust as a refugee. He knows, therefore, firsthand the consequences of hatred and intolerance and has devoted his life to fighting them. As founder and president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he has encouraged interfaith dialog, intercultural understanding, and the cause of religious freedom around the world. He has served as international envoy for four administrations, including my own.;As Chairman of the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad and as the long-time rabbi of Park East Synagogue in New York City, Rabbi, I thank you for all the many things you have done here with me the last 8 years to promote religious liberty around the world, and I thank you for a lifetime of good work and good examples. I look forward to seeing you in New York, where perhaps you will become my rabbi. Thank you.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Before he was 40 years old, Eli Segal had already built a string of successful businesses. He had also had a string of successful friends. In 1992, by blind accident, I wound up being one of them, and I asked my old friend, Eli Segal, to join my administration, where he built from scratch two of our most successful programs.;Eli began AmeriCorps, which has already given more than 150,000 young people a chance to serve in their communities and, in so doing, earn some money for college. Indeed, more people served in AmeriCorps in the first 5 years of its existence than in the first 25 years of the Peace Corps' existence.;After he returned briefly to private life and his great affinity for making money, I called him back, and I said we needed some more help. He then built our Welfare to Work Partnership, which enlisted in the space of about 3 years, over 20,000 businesses, in hiring more than one million people from the welfare rolls.;These efforts have both widened the circle of opportunity in America and strengthened the tradition of service to country. For this, all Americans owe Eli Segal a special debt of gratitude. If you have ever seen the faces of those young AmeriCorps kids or the pride of people who have moved from welfare to work, you know why we're in Eli's debt. Thank you very much.;[ The President presented the medal. ];John Seiberling has worn many hats and won many accolades. As a soldier in World War II, as a lawyer for the New York Legal Aids Society, a community planner for his beloved city of Akron, a Congressman from Ohio fighting for civil rights and arms control—in all arenas he has contributed to community and country. But his greatest achievement was crafting and winning passage of the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, which doubled the size of our inventory of national parks and wildlife refugees and tripled the area of federally designated wilderness. With that legislation, John Seiberling singlehandedly saved more of our wilderness than any previous American, a legacy that will last for generations.;Unfortunately, this environmental hero is unable to join us today, but we are very glad that his son John will accept the medal on his behalf.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Few newspaper publishers in American history have been more effective crusaders for justice than the late John Sengstacke. As owner and editor of the legendary Chicago Defender for almost 60 years, he provided a national forum for African-American issues and voices that otherwise would have gone unheard. He nurtured the talents of countless black journalists, and as a confidant of Presidents, played a key roll in integrating the armed services, the Postal Service, Major League Baseball, and the White House press corps.;On behalf of a grateful nation, I offer this medal posthumously to his son, Bobby.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When bigots blew up his house with dynamite, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth stood in front of the smoking rubble and renewed his call for an integrated Birmingham. When the city fathers had him arrested for civil disobedience, he filled the jails with so many sympathetic protesters, there was no room to hold them all. When angry authorities blasted him with a firehose, he told them they could knock him down, but they could not extinguish the torch of justice.;Fred Shuttlesworth risked his life so that every American, no matter the color of his or her skin, might live in a nation of dignity, opportunity, and equal justice under law. We thank him for a lifetime of leadership and for an unextinguished spirit.;[ The President presented the medal. ];She was born in England, but Elizabeth Taylor became thoroughly American royalty. For more than a generation, she has reigned over the silver screen, stirring hearts and capturing imaginations. She earned two Oscars and countless other honors as an actress.;But perhaps her greatest role has been off the screen, as a relentless and very, very early crusader for AIDS research and care. She has not only raised—[ applause ]—she raised millions and millions of dollars in this fight and raised awareness about the human impact of this dreaded disease before many, many others were on the bandwagon.;Elizabeth Taylor has brought to life unforgettable characters on film, but she has brought even more hope to millions around the world. We thank her for sharing her talent and her heart. Thank you, Elizabeth Taylor.;[ The President presented the medal. ];When the Nazis marched on Vienna, a 6year-old girl fled with her mother across Europe, only to wind up in an internment camp rife with starvation, disease, and death. Out of that searing experience, Marion Wiesel summoned the courage to commit her life to teaching others, especially children, about the human cost of hatred, intolerance, and racism.;She has written a documentary about the 1.3 million children murdered in the Holocaust and has translated the books of her husband, Elie Wiesel, so that countless more people can read and learn their lessons. With the money from his Nobel Prize, she and Elie established the Wiesel Foundation, to educate children against indifference to the suffering of others.;Marion, for your mission of hope against hate, of life against death, of good over evil, it is an honor to award you this Citizens Medal.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Patrisha Wright was training to be an orthopedic surgeon when a degenerative muscle disease left her with double vision. Instead of fixing broken bones, she set about to fix what was broken in our system and dedicated her life to ending discrimination against people with disabilities. As founder of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, she joined forces with the wider civil rights community. Her strategic brilliance and no-nonsense approach during passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act earned her the title of "The General." Now she works to empower people and families with disabilities throughout the entire world.;Ever since a visual impairment changed the path of her career, her dedication to civil rights has changed the path of America and helped more of us to see clearly. Today, we salute you, "The General," Patrisha Wright.;[ The President presented the medal. ];Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for joining us to honor these remarkable people. Some of them are famous, and some were not, at least until today. Some of them had their service thrust upon them by circumstances, others chose the path. Whatever their stories, together they form a remarkable fabric of what is best about our country, what is best about its history, and what is most encouraging when we look to the future.;They remind us, once again, something that I need to remember in these days, that the greatest title any one of us can ever hold is that of citizen.;Thank you, and goodbye.</td></tr>

Here's the way I like to put it: Mi Casa Blanca es su Casa Blanca. [ Laughter ];We're gathered here to celebrate the contributions of Hispanic Americans to our life. In a few moments, I will sign a Executive order creating a Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans, to open new doors of opportunity for Hispanic boys and girls all across America.;Before I do, I have some thanks. First, I want to thank mi abogado y tambien mi amigo. I want to thank Judge Gonzales for his sound advice. I love him dearly.;I want to thank the boys and girls for leading us in the pledge. Thank you all for being here. I don't know whether you know this or not, but 52 million other children joined us at 2 o'clock today, saying the Pledge of Allegiance, all across America. The past weeks have given new meaning to those old words and have only deepened our allegiance to our Nation and to our flag.;I want to thank Jaci and Arturo for lending their voice and horn to this room. We've had some great music here throughout the years, and it's going to be hard to top what we heard today. I want to thank them both for coming. I want to thank all los voces Americanos that sang today. I am honored that you all are here. I love your music. I love your passion. I love your love for America. And we're glad you're here. And I'm glad America got to see some of our country's finest artists perform here in the East Room on a song that talks about the solidarity and love for our country, a love that knows no bounds, a love that knows no culture, a love that everybody can share who's lucky enough to live in America. And you all are welcome. Thank you for coming.;I want to thank Emilio, especially, for lending your talents. The last time you were here was Cinco de Mayo. I said, "The next time you come, make sure you bring Gloria." [ Laughter ] It just goes to show the power of the Presidency. [ Laughter ];I want to thank Luis Palau as well, for your prayer. And I want to thank Don Francisco as well. It's good to see you again, sir. Thank you for coming.;I'm proud that there's dos Embajadores aqui, uno de Mexico —good to see you, Ambassador—Juan Jose Bremer from Mexico y tambien el Embajador de Espan˜ a esta aqui, Javier— bienvenidos, Javier. I should have said there was three Ambassadors. I meant, two Ambassadors to America, but one of—a friend of mine I named the Ambassador to the Dominican Republic has joined us, Hans Hertell. Hans, good to see you, Hans.;I named a person who participated in Operation Pedro Pan. For those of you who don't know Operation Pedro Pan, years ago, Cuban moms and dads put their sons or daughters on a boat to America in order that they could live freely. They were uncertain about their own fate, but they knew they wanted their children to grow up in America, one of whom is now here. He's in my Cabinet, Mel Martinez.;I named a good man to be on the U.S. Court of Appeals, the DC Circuit, a man named Miguel Estrada. Miguel, where are you? Thank you for coming, Miguel. You know, there's a lot of talk in Washington about making sure we have diversity on our courts, and there should be. I ask the Senate to move this man's nomination through. He's smart. He's capable. He needs that job. America needs to have him on the bench. Get him moving, before it's too late.;Ambassador to the OAS representing America, Roger Noriega. Roger—there he is. Roger, how are you, buddy? The next time, we'll try to get you a better seat. [ Laughter ] Either that, or show up on time. [ Laughter ];Al Rascon, who is the National Director of the U.S. Selective Service and, more importantly, a recipient of the Medal of Honor, is with us today. Thank you, Al, for being here.;A man whose service has been called upon a lot, particularly for the businesses that were severely affected during the attack, Hector Barreto, the SBA Director. Leslie Sanchez, who is the Executive Director to the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans. Where are you, Leslie? Leslie, right in front of me. The Treasurer of the United States, Rosario Marin—Rosario. Cristina Saralegui—where is she? Cristina.;As you know, I used to be associated with the baseball world, and we're honored to have some Major Leaguers here with us today. And we've got a great White Sox outfielder. Donde esta Senor Ordonez from the White Sox? There he is. Como esta, Magglio? Welcome. Glad you're here. Another Ordonez, Rey Ordonez. Good to see you, Rey. Thank you for coming. Maybe next year. [ Laughter ] Nelson Figueroa de la Phillies. Good to see you, Nelson. Thank you for coming. I'll get you afterwards. And from the San Francisco Giants, Russ Ortiz. Russ, thank you for coming.;I'm honored you all are here. Thanks for coming. Thanks for setting a good example. Thanks for understanding that people look at you off the field of play as well as on the field of play. It's important that there be—young boys and girls look up to our baseball players and see a good example, and you're setting that. We're honored that you're here with us.;We also have three with us today who represent the thousands of Hispanic Americans who serve in law enforcement and public safety. It's been a particularly trying time in New York City for the firefighters and police officers. Fortunately, we have three gentlemen today who represent those fine men and women: Anthony Miranda of the New York City Latino Officers Association—Anthony, thank you for coming—[ applause ]—let me try this a different way. [ Laughter ] We have two others to introduce. [ Laughter ] From the Hispanic Society of the New York City Police Department, we've got Louis Hernandez, and— [ laughter ]—from the Hispanic Society of the New York City Fire Department, Miguel Ramos. Now, thank you all for coming. Good job. Thanks for coming. [ Applause ] It is clear America is pulling for you all. And please pass on the word to the men and women who wear the uniform how proud we are and how much we mourn with you and how heroic you have been. The Nation appreciates it very much.;You know, obviously this is a time of great national unity. The evil ones struck, but they forgot who they were striking, evidently. They thought they were going to weaken us, but they didn't. We're strong and united. I've been amazed by the incredible acts of kindness that I've heard about, and obviously we've all been impressed by the acts of heroism. This is the good news that has come during this tragedy. We've all come to realize how much we need each other.;Today there's been another reported case of anthrax, in New York City at NBC News. And it has got to cause concern for our Nation. But I want everybody in the country to know we're responding rapidly. First of all, the person is feeling fine. She's doing well. She obviously didn't ingest enough to cause death, thank God. But we've got teams on the ground—the CDC, Center for Disease Control, the FBI, working closely with local agencies to respond quickly.;Our Nation is still in danger. But the Government is doing everything in our power to protect our citizenry. We need each other more than ever, and we're responding as quickly and as forcefully as we can.;The American people need to go about their lives. We cannot let the terrorists lock our country down. We can't let terrorists, a few evildoers, hold us hostage. Our Government will fight terrorism across the seas, and we'll fight it here at home. And the American people need to fight terrorism as well, by going to work, going to ball games, getting on airplanes, singing with joy and strength, like you all did today. They will not take this country down.;We will not be cowed, and we're certainly not going to be divided. The evil ones, as well as the rest of the world, are learning that we're a nation made up of many cultures, many races, and many religions, but we are one strong nation. We've suffered loss together, we have entered a mighty struggle together, and we will prevail together. The diversity of America has always been—always been—a great strength of this country. Here, you can be proud of your cultural heritage, proud of your ancestry, proud of your native language, and still be a proud American.;We see the spirit of pride today, most vividly in the ties between our country and los que viven en Latin America—y tambien el sur de America. A lifetime in Texas has given me many things to be thankful for, one of them, for certain, is my appreciation for the Hispanic culture. I realize how much the Hispanic culture has enriched my State. And I realize how much the Hispanic culture enriches my Nation, as well.;This month, our country recognizes just how much we owe to the Hispanic culture and, more important, to the Hispanic Americans we're proud to call our fellow citizens. And we do so—as we do so, we recognize as well our obligation to ensure that every American has an equal place in our society from the earliest years in life.;This Nation of immigrant heritage believes that all children, whatever their circumstances, deserve a chance to learn and rise and succeed. This principle has guided my education reforms as we work to raise the standards of public schools across America and bring hope to every classroom for every child—I mean every child, not just a few, not just those whose parents may speak English. We want educational excellence para todos que viven en este pais.;So today I am creating a commission to help chart the path to greater achievement amongst Hispanic American students in every part of our country. I am pleased to sign this order in front of such distinguished company. And I'm proud—I'm proud—to be the President of such a great nation.;Thank you for coming. And God bless.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c2"><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=64472&st=dominican&st1=" target="blank">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=64472&st=dominican&st1=</a></td><td class="c5">George W. Bush: Letter to Congressional Leaders on Major Illicit Drug-Producing or Major Drug-Transit Countries</td><td class="c6">November 1, 2001</td><td class="c7">Dear;In accordance with section 490(h) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), I have determined that the following countries are major illicit drug-producing or major drug-transit countries: Afghanistan, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.;I note that a country's presence on the list of major drug-transit countries is not an adverse reflection on its government's counternarcotics efforts or on the level of its cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-transit country set forth in section 481(e)(5) of the FAA, among the reasons that major drug-transit countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit despite the most assiduous enforcement measures of the government concerned.;In recent years, we have seen rapidly rising quantities of illegal synthetic drugs entering the United States, especially MDMA (Ecstasy) from Europe. MDMA abuse is an emerging problem that we are studying closely. Because much of the Ecstasy consumed in Europe and the United States is manufactured clandestinely in the Netherlands, we are working closely with Dutch authorities to stop the production and export of the drug. I commend the Government of the Netherlands for its excellent cooperation with the Government of the United States.;Changes to the List;I have removed Cambodia from the Majors List. Cambodia was added to the Majors List in 1996 as a transit country for heroin destined for the United States. In recent years, there has been no evidence of any heroin transiting Cambodia coming to the United States. On the basis of this cumulative evidence, I have determined that Cambodia no longer meets the standard for a major drug-transit country and I have removed Cambodia from the Majors List. I will, however, keep it under observation as a country of concern.;Countries/Economies and Regions of Concern;I am also noting in this letter various "countries/economies and regions of concern." These are countries or areas that are not "majors," but which in the past met, or could in the future meet, the statutory definition. This informational category carries no stigma, penalty, or sanction. This information is provided to keep the Congress informed of those additional countries and regions on which the executive branch is focusing its antidrug cooperation efforts.;The Majors List applies by its terms to "countries." The United States Government interprets the term broadly to include certain entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that would lead to a decision to place them on the list and subsequently to determine eligibility for certification.;Belize. Belize was removed from the list of major drug-transit countries in 1999 because there was clear evidence that the drug trade was not currently using it as a transit point for drugs moving to the United States. If, at a future date, there is reliable information that U.S.-bound drugs are again moving through Belize in significant quantities, I will again place it on the Majors List.;Central America. Central America's position as a land bridge between South America and Mexico, together with its thousands of miles of coastline, several container-handling ports, the Pan-American Highway, and limited law enforcement capability, makes the entire region a natural conduit and transshipment area for illicit drugs bound for Mexico and the United States. Currently, only Guatemala and Panama have been designated major drug-transit countries, since there is clear evidence that drug trafficking organizations use their territory to move significant quantities of illegal drugs to the United States. The same is not yet true of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, or Nicaragua.;Although there is no question that fluctuating quantities of drugs do flow through these countries en route to the United States, the bulk of the drug traffic has shifted away from land routes. Stringent law enforcement and interdiction measures on land have forced trafficking organizations to move drugs along sea routes. In the event that I receive evidence that drugs transiting these countries are having a significant effect on the United States, I will add them to the Majors List.;Central Asia. United States Government agencies have again conducted probes in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the traditional opium poppy growing areas of the former Soviet Union. These probes did not show significant opium poppy cultivation. If ongoing analysis reveals cultivation of 1,000 hectares or more of poppy, I will add the relevant countries to the Majors List.;Cuba. Cuba's geographical position, straddling one of the principal Caribbean trafficking routes to the United States, continues to make it a logical candidate for consideration for the Majors List. While in the past there have been some anecdotal reports that trafficking syndicates use Cuban land territory for moving drugs, we have not confirmed that this traffic carries significant quantities of cocaine or heroin to the United States. For the last several years, much of the suspect air traffic that previously crossed Cuban airspace has shifted to Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). I will continue to keep Cuba under careful observation for any changes in current transit patterns. If there is evidence of significant quantities of drugs transiting Cuba to the United States, I will add Cuba to the Majors List.;Eastern Caribbean. The Leeward and Windward Islands, together with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, constitute a broad geographical area through which U.S.bound drugs pass en route from Latin America. There is no evidence at this time, however, that any of these Eastern Caribbean nations is a major drug-transit country under the definition in section 481(e)(5) of the FAA. The information available indicates that drugs moving through the area are overwhelmingly destined for Europe. I am, therefore, keeping the region under observation and will add relevant countries to the Majors List, should conditions warrant.;Hong Kong. Hong Kong was removed from the Majors List in 2000 and listed as a country of concern. Since 1996, there have been no significant seizures in the United States of heroin linked with Hong Kong. Similarly, the Hong Kong authorities report that in the past 4 years they have made no large seizures locally of heroin destined for the United States. If in the future we detect any drug flows through Hong Kong that significantly affect the United States, I will again place Hong Kong on the Majors List.;Iran. While Iran was once a traditional opium-producing country, the Government of Iran appears to have been successful in eradicating significant illicit opium poppy cultivation. The latest United States Government survey of the country revealed no detectable poppy cultivation in the traditional growing areas. Although one cannot rule out some cultivation in remote parts of the country, it is unlikely that it would be sufficient to meet the threshold definition of a major illicit drug-producing country under section 481(e)(2) of the FAA.;Important quantities of opiates reportedly continue to transit Iran en route to Europe, but I have no evidence that these drugs significantly affect the United States, a requirement for designation as a major drug-transit country under section 481(e)(5) of the FAA. Moreover, Iran has taken extensive measures to thwart the use of its territory by drug traffickers, seizing well above 200 metric tons of drugs annually in recent years.;Malaysia. Malaysia was removed from the Majors List in 1998 because there was no evidence that drugs transiting the country were reaching the United States in significant quantities. That situation did not change in 2001.;North Korea. United States Government observations this year have been unable to confirm reports that significant quantities of opium poppy may be under cultivation in North Korea or that heroin originating in the country may be entering the international drug trade. I continue, however, to monitor the situation. If there is evidence that there is indeed significant poppy cultivation or that North Korea is a transit point for drugs significantly affecting the United States, I will add it to the Majors List.;Syria and Lebanon. Syria and Lebanon were removed from the list of major drug producers 4 years ago after the United States Government determined that there was no significant opium poppy cultivation in Lebanon's Biqa' Valley. Recent surveys have confirmed that there has been no detectable replanting of opium poppy, and we have no evidence that drugs transiting these countries significantly affect the United States. I continue, however, to keep the area under observation.;Taiwan. Taiwan was removed from the Majors List in 2000, because there was no evidence that it was any longer a transit point for drugs destined for the United States. Stringent law enforcement procedures, together with enhanced customs inspection and surveillance methods, have all but cut off serious flows of heroin from Taiwan to the United States. At the same time, the opening of major container ports in southern China has diminished Taiwan's importance for the drug trade. If in the future we detect any drug flows through Taiwan that significantly affect the United States, I will place Taiwan on the Majors List.;Turkey and Other Balkan Route Countries. I continue to be concerned by the large volume of Southwest Asian heroin that moves through Turkey and neighboring countries to Western Europe along the Balkan Route. There is no clear evidence, however, that this heroin significantly affects the United States. In the event that I determine that heroin transiting Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or other European countries on the Balkan Route significantly affects the United States, I will add the relevant countries to the Majors List.;Major Cannabis Producers. While Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, the Philippines, and South Africa are significant cannabis producers, I have not included them on this list since in all cases the illicit cannabis is either consumed locally or exported to countries other than the United States. I have determined that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.;Sincerely;GEORGE W. BUSH</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Reception for Hispanic Heritage Month</td><td class="c6">October 9, 2002</td><td class="c7">Bienvenidos. It is such an honor to have you all here to the Casa Blanca, la casa de todos que viven en esta pais. As the Surgeon General mentioned, I'm just a temporary resident—[ laughter ]—but es un gran honor para mi familia de vivir aqui.;I want to thank you all for coming. Hispanic Heritage Month is an important month for our country, particularly now that we're at a time of war. You see, Hispanic Heritage Month talks to the great diversity of our country and the fact that our country is a strong country because of our diversity.;And this particular month we welcome the influence of the Hispano in our country. We welcome the great values that our Hispanic Americans bring to America, the values of faith y familia. Part of our entrepreneurial spirit is made stronger by the Hispanics who live in America. We're really proud of this heritage. We appreciate the hard work. We appreciate the determination.;I love the stories of our Surgeon General, the success stories of families who have sought a better day and have worked hard, and Americans have been able to reap the benefit of the greatest country in the face of the Earth. So welcome to the White House. It's an honor for me to welcome you here.;Obviously, we're celebrating—one of the things we celebrate in Hispanic Heritage Month is the great talent of many Hispanos, and we saw some great talent today. And I want to thank Carlos Ponce for being the emcee. Carlos, I'm going to be watching the eBay auctions very carefully. [ Laughter ] Times get tough. [ Laughter ];I appreciate las Tejanas. I appreciate Jaci Velasquez y tambien Jennifer Pena. They're great talent. I'm proud to call them Texans. We've got some great talent in our State, and these are two of the best. And I really want to thank you all for coming. And make sure you tell everybody at home I might have changed addresses, but I haven't changed homes. [ Laughter ];And I also want to thank Gian Marco. Listen, if he's the first Peruvian here, we might as well have started with one of the best. [ Laughter ] And I'm honored you're here, Gian. Thank you for coming.;I want to thank Johnny Delgado from the Baltimore Police Department for starting this, for reciting the Pledge. Johnny represents many of our Hispanic Americans who serve on the frontlines in the war against terror, our firefighters, our police officers, our EMS teams. And I'm so honored, Johnny, that you're here, and thanks for coming. On behalf of a grateful nation, I want to thank you and all the good folks who wear the uniform for the job you do.;I want to thank Senator Orrin Hatch for coming. He's a great friend of—he's a good buddy. I'm glad he's here. I'm glad he's in the Senate. [ Laughter ] One of my jobs is to put together an administration that is talented, an administration here to serve the country, not themselves, an administration that reflects the diversity of our country. And I'm doing just that. Obviously, you met our new Surgeon General, Rich Carmona. Rich is a—he's a piece of work. [ Laughter ] He'll do a fabulous job in that incredibly important position.;Gaddi Vasquez, who is Director of the Peace Corps, is here. Gaddi, thank you for coming. Hans Hertell is an Embajador de — to the Dominican Republic, is with us today. Hans is from Puerto Rico, a good friend of mine.;There's another Ambassador here who's not an American, but nevertheless he is the Embajador de Mexico, our close friends, Mexico. I appreciate Ambassador Bremer for coming. I'm honored you're here.;Mira, y tambien un otro amigo de mio. He is the Gobernador, the Governor of Tamulipas, Tomas Yarrington. I appreciate you coming, Gobernador. I don't know if this helps or hurts him, but he is a rising star in Mexican politics. [ Laughter ] I've known him, obviously when I was the Governor of Texas and now as the President. He's a good fellow, and I'm proud to call him friend.;Rosario Marin is here with us. Rosario is the Treasurer of the United States. Hector Barreto is the Small Business Administrator. I appreciate you coming, Hector. Eduardo Aguirre, who is the head of the— Vice Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. Eduardo, I'm glad you are here.;Jose Fourquet, who is the United States Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank—Jose, thank you for coming. Where are you, Jose? Oh, there he is. These are people I've appointed. These are part of the diversity of our administration. I'm glad they're here so I can herald their—their accomplishment and their service to the country.;Everybody has got to have a good lawyer—[ laughter ]—particularly me. Mi abogado es un Tejano, Al Gonzalez, my good friend.;Our military is—the Hispanic population in our country has served disproportionately in our military. The Hispanic population steps up when the country says, we need service. And they do. They have throughout our history. Today we've got with us Major General Chris Cortez of the United States Marine Corps. I've got great confidence in our military. I've got confidence in our troops. I'll talk a little bit about that in a second. But General, thanks for coming.;I appreciate my friend Emilio Estefan, who is the producer of this outfit. You want to talk about a cool guy. [ Laughter ];We happen to have Miss Universe with us today, from Panama. Thank you for coming, Miss Universe. And I see my friend Raul from Texas is sitting next to you. [ Laughter ] He's probably claiming he should have that seat because he's from Panama and a Texan. [ Laughter ] I suspect it's for other reasons, but nevertheless. [ Laughter ];As you probably know, as the Surgeon General mentioned, I'm a baseball fan. I love baseball. Some of the best years of my life were watching the mighty Rangers, and we've got a couple of mighty Rangers here with us. I saw one guy grow up from a 19-year-old kid, who's one of the greats of all time, and that's Pudge Rodriguez. I want to thank you for coming, Pudge.;And my daughters used to love to come to the game, and they fell in love early in life with Rafael Palmeiro. [ Laughter ] And I want to thank you all for bringing your families. Yes, mira, thanks for coming, guys. I appreciate you. Hi, Lynn. How are you doing? Rosa.;I want to thank Nomar Garciaparra from the Red Sox for coming. Nomar, thanks for being here. Nomar, when we had the first tee-ball game at the White House, was there. And one of the things we're trying to do is use our backyard to promote baseball. And we had these kids come, and Nomar was here to help kick that off. I'm so honored you came.;I appreciate Octavio Dotel from the Houston Astros. Octavio, good to see you. Nelson Figueroa— donde esta Nelson? Nelson, thank you for coming.;These are the current players. These guys are stars and potential Hall of Famers. But we're also really fortunate to have some Hall of Famers with us, people who've actually done what these players are doing.;It is such an honor to have four Hall of Famers, starting with Rod Carew. Man, that guy could hit. I appreciate you coming, Rod. Tony Perez, Luis Aparicio, yes, y por fin, Juan Marichal—I'm really glad you all are here. You brighten my day. [ Laughter ] Thanks for coming.;One of my jobs as well is to make sure our bench is strong. I've named a fantastic Hispanic American to the bench, a young guy named Miguel Estrada. I named him to one of the highest courts possible, to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. It's an incredibly important appointment. He's well qualified. He is very smart. He came to our country from El Salvador. He couldn't speak English. He's now been picked, amongst all the candidates, to take on this highest of high positions in the bench. He's having trouble in the United States Senate.;There are some Senators—certainly not Senator Hatch, who is one of his strongest advocates—there are Senators who are playing politics with this good man's nomination. There are Senators who would rather not give him the benefit of the doubt, Senators looking for a reason to defeat him, as opposed to looking for a reason to herald his intelligence, his capabilities, his talent. I strongly object to the way this man is going to be treated in the Senate. I urge the Senate to confirm the nomination of Miguel Estrada.;I talked about our military. The reason we're talking about our military these days is because we're at war, and we're at war for precisely the reason why we're here. We're at war because we love freedom. We love the fact that people are free in America, free to worship an Almighty any way you see fit, free to come to this country with a dream and realize the dream, free to express your opinion, free to—if you happen to be in the press—to write anything you want to write. That's freedom, and that's what we love. And it's hard to believe, but there's an enemy which hates freedom and hates us as a result of our embrace of freedom. And so therefore, we're at war. We're at war, and we're still at war. We're still at risk here in America. We're at risk because there's some enemies still lurking around out there.;This is a different kind of war, as the General would tell you. In the old days, you could destroy the person's tanks or airplanes or ships and be making progress. But these people don't have tanks. They don't have ships. They hide in caves and send youngsters to their suicidal death.;And see, so long as we embrace the diversity and freedom of our country, which we will always do, and so long as they're lurking out there, we're at war. But make no mistake, sin duda venceremos. There's no doubt about it. We will win because of what we love. We will win because we're determined and strong. We will win because we're a nation which holds values dear to our heart. And we refuse to be intimidated by anybody, at any place, at any time. We will win because we want to uphold our duty and obligation to leave America intact and free, so future generations of people, Hispanic or otherwise, can realize dreams, can succeed, can realize their God-given talents. That's what this is all about.;And so I want to thank you for coming to honor this month, but I want to assure you that this great Nation will lead the world to be more free.;And we've got some difficult tasks at hand. Not only, we must chase down the Al Qaida, one by one, which we continue to do to this very day, but we've also got to deal with threats that are real. And I gave a speech to the Nation the other day to discuss those threats in sober terms, to talk about the realities of the world in which we live.;It used to be in this great country we had two oceans protecting us, and if somebody had a problem across the sea, we might help them or we might not. Today, these oceans—the fact that the oceans no longer protect us mean that the battleground is here. So this great country will be deliberate. We will rally other nations. We will give other people a chance to deal with Iraq, for example.;The U.N., the United Nations now has a chance, Mr. Ambassador. As a member of the Security Council, I'm confident your nation will join us to—to send a clear message that this man must disarm before he hurts America or anybody else. And he has to make a choice. We're a patient nation. He's got a choice to make. His choice is, he must do what he said he was going to do. He said he wasn't going to have weapons of mass destruction. That's what we expect. We take a man for his word.;But if he doesn't disarm and if the United Nations won't act, for the sake of our freedom, we will lead other countries that love freedom as much as we do and disarm him. We owe it to our children. We love peace in this country, and when we see threats to peace, we will deal with them in a deliberate, calm, logical, and, if need be, forceful way.;And as we work to make America a more secure place and a safer place, we've got to make it a better place too. And that means making sure everybody gets a good education in our country—everybody.;We passed a really good education bill. I want to share the spirit of the bill, because I believe it speaks to the month we're celebrating. It says that every child can learn. That's the first thing. See, it starts with the attitude that if—if there are low expectations, if perhaps a school district or people think that because a parent doesn't speak English as a first language, therefore a certain child may not be able to learn, we're going to challenge that.;See, when you have low standards, you're liable to get bad results. That's what I have called the soft bigotry of low expectations. We have challenged that soft bigotry. We say in this country, every child can learn— every child—not just some, not a select few, not those who may live in the nice suburban districts, but every child can learn.;And then it says that in return for receiving Federal money, we want to know. You see, in return for receiving Federal money, we expect local districts and States to show us whether or not each child is learning.;And when we find the fact that some children are not learning, we must correct problems early, before it's too late. Everybody counts in America. Each child matters in this country. To make sure we have a better America, no child—not one single child—needs be left behind.;I believe this Nation is strong in its diversity. We love our freedom. It's an incredibly great nation. And out of the evil done to our country on September the 11th, 2001, will come incredible good. That's what you must know about our Nation. Out of the evil done to America can come some great good.;If we stay tough and firm and strong, we can achieve peace. We can achieve peace for people here at home, we can achieve peace in the world. And by being— by loving your neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself, we can achieve a better tomorrow. We can work together to eradicate the pockets of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair. People can fight evil by doing some good, by putting your arm around a lost soul and saying, "I love you. My fellow American, I love you.;There is no question in my mind, because of our strength, diversity, because of the values we hold, that we will be a stronger and more compassionate and better nation.;I want to thank you all for coming to celebrate this important month. It is an honor for me to welcome you to the White House. I appreciate so very much your contributions to our country.;May God bless you all.</td></tr>

The United States Government interprets the term broadly to include entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that could lead to a decision to place them on the list and, subsequently, to determine their eligibility for certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma, Guatemala, and Haiti as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this memorandum are justifications for each of the countries so designated, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that provision of United States assistance to Guatemala and Haiti in FY 2003 is vital to the national interests of the United States.;Additionally, the alarming increase in the quantity of illegal synthetic drugs entering the United States, especially ecstasy from Europe, is of particular concern. A significant amount of the ecstasy consumed in the United States is manufactured clandestinely in The Netherlands (in 2001, a total of 9.5 million ecstasy tablets were seized in the United States, and the Drug Enforcement Administration believes that the majority of tablets originated in The Netherlands). We are working closely with Dutch authorities to stop the production and export of ecstasy, which we both regard as a serious threat to our citizens. We expect Dutch authorities to move effectively and measurably in the coming year against the production and export of this drug, including dismantling labs and proceeding against trafficking organizations. Early in the year, we plan to discuss specific steps we can take together to reduce drug trafficking.;Although the United States enjoys an excellent level of bilateral cooperation with Canada, the United States Government is concerned that Canada is a primary source of pseudoephedrine and an increasing source of high potency marijuana, which are exported to the United States. Over the past few years there has been an alarming increase in the amount of pseudoephedrine diverted from Canadian sources to clandestine drug laboratories in the United States, where it is used to make methamphetamine. The Government of Canada, for the most part, has not regulated the sale and distribution of precursor chemicals. The regulations to restrict the availability of pseudoephedrine, which the Government of Canada has just promulgated, should be stronger. Notwithstanding Canada's inadequate control of illicit diversion of precursor chemicals, I commend Canadian law enforcement agencies, which continue to work energetically to support our joint law enforcement efforts.;Under section 706 of the FRAA, you are hereby authorized and directed to submit this memorandum to the Congress, and to publish it in the Federal Register.;George W. Bush</td></tr>

I want to thank mi abogado and my close friend for his leadership and his participation in our Government. Everybody has got to have a good lawyer— [ laughter ]—especially in my line of work. [ Laughter ] And I've got a great one with Al Gonzales. I'm proud to call him friend.;And I also want to thank the members of the Latino Coalition who are here today. I want to thank you for your work in— obviously, on political issues. But really I want to thank you for what you're doing in your own community, showing people that through hard work there's opportunity and hope, that if you're an entrepreneur— thanks for setting such a great example. Truly, one of the greatest things about the Nation is that somebody who's got a dream and who works hard can own their own business, realize their own potential. So thanks for setting the example for a lot of our fellow citizens.;I'm honored that Mel Martinez is here with us, and Hector Barreto, serving my administration. Both men are doing a fine job in important positions. I want to thank Ambassador Hans Hertell from the Dominican Republic for coming. [ Applause ] I see you brought an entourage with you. [ Laughter ] Rosario Marin, who's the Treasurer, is here. Rosario, great to see you. Josefina Carbonell, who is the Assistant Secretary for Aging, Health and Human Services, is with us.;I want to thank very much the—Robert de Posada, who is the president of the Latino Coalition. I also want to thank Jane Delgado as well for your leadership and for working for what you think is right for the country.;El Gobernador del Estado de Hidalgo is with us today. Gobernador, bienvenidos. Glad you're here. I see my friend Alfredo Phillips. One of the great honors when I was the Governor of Texas was to work closely with our Mexican counterparts. Senor Phillips was a man who came to Austin quite frequently to talk about NADBank and mutual development programs. I'm honored you're here. I appreciate your delegation coming.;This Nation is committed to making sure we've got great relations with Mexico. The cornerstone of good foreign policy starts with making sure the neighborhood is prosperous and peaceful. I look forward to continuing to work with Vicente Fox on advancing a common agenda for the good of both nations.;And so I welcome you all here. You come to America today during times of great challenges. There are some challenges which face us, but there's no hurdle big enough for the American people not to cross. This is—we've got some mighty challenges to make sure the country is more prosperous and more hopeful and the world more peaceful. But sin duda, we're going to achieve what we need to achieve, porque este pais es un gran pais, with great values and great hope and great strength.;The first challenge we have is to make sure people can find work. We want everybody working who wants to find a job. The challenge was created, really, because of a recession and an attack on America and the fact that some of our fellow citizens didn't realize that they needed to tell the truth all the time when it came to the numbers on their balance sheets. All three of those circumstances has created a challenge for the country. And the challenge is how to make sure the entrepreneurial environment is strong and steady, so that people are confident in taking risk, that small businesses are willing to take risk to expand.;And so I put out an economic plan that addresses the challenges that we face. First, I want to remind you we responded to the recession by tax relief. We believe that if a person has more money in their pockets, they're likely to demand a good or a service. And when they do so in the marketplace, somebody is likely to produce the good or a service. And when that happens, somebody is more likely to find work. That's the premise of the economic policy we laid out in '01. I worked with the Republicans and Democrats to get the tax plan through.;We responded to the attacks on September the 11th, 2001. We had terrorism insurance bill passed to encourage construction programs to go forward. We dealt with the airline issue. We got the stock market opened up quickly. And of course, then we liberated Afghanistan as we sought to bring justice to the killers of the thousands of Americans and others.;We dealt with the corporate scandals by passing the law that clearly says that if you lie, cheat, or steal, that if you defraud a shareholder or an employee, there is going to be certain consequences.;And so we made progress. But the economy still needs more work as far as we're concerned. And so I've gone to Congress, and I want to share with you quite quickly, quite briefly what I am asking Congress to do.;First of all, I think it's very important for us to focus on small-business growth. We're interested in job creation. The first thing—the first fact that Congress has got to understand is most small—most jobs are created by small businesses, most new jobs. And so, therefore, any package ought to be focused on small business in America. And this package is. It basically says, we're—we've asked Congress to cut rates. They did, but they phased in the tax rate cuts over 3, 5, or 7 years. Well, if the economy is not doing as well as it should today, and if Congress has one time seen the wisdom of letting people keep more of their own money, then step one is they ought to accelerate the tax relief plan to this year. All tax cuts in the future ought to be accelerated to this year. If they're good enough 5 years from now, they're good enough today.;Most small businesses are sole proprietorships or limited partnerships or Sub-chapter S corporations, which means that they pay tax at the individual income-tax rate. And so therefore, when you accelerate rate cuts, you're really accelerating capital to be invested by small businesses. And that's what Congress must understand. The rate reduction package is good for the small-business sector of the American economy.;As well, we believe we ought to increase the amount of expensing available to small businesses from the current limitation of $25,000 to $75,000 a year. This will encourage capital expenditure. It will provide incentive for people to expand their businesses. Capital expenditure equals jobs, and the more capital accumulation and capital expenditure we can encourage, the more likely it is somebody is going to find work.;And so this plan focuses on boosting the amount of money consumers have to spend, strengthening demand for products. But it also focuses on capital accumulation, capital formation, particularly at the small-business sector of the American economy.;Furthermore, I believe we ought to eliminate the double taxation on dividends, and I will tell you why. If capital equals jobs, the double taxation of dividends means there is less capital in the private markets for investment. It's fair to tax a company's profits. It is unfair to tax that profit again when it's distributed to one of the shareholders. And so our plan encourages capital formation. Our plan addresses the needs of the 10 million seniors who have dividend income. It is beneficial for those seniors not to have to pay a tax on their dividends. As a matter of fact, it will help them in the later years of their lives.;The dividend plan also is going to have a positive effect on our accounting process. I mean, after all, we went through a period of time when people said, "Invest in my company. Even though I may not have any earnings, I've got a good idea. So let's invest"—let's invest in something that may or may not happen. A society which is focused on dividends says, you know, cash is really what matters. You can't—if you say, "Invest in my company. I'm going to pay you a dividend," it's not based upon some pie-in-the-sky projection. It's based on the reality of cash. The dividend policy, if more companies pay dividends, will have a positive effect when it comes to the balance sheets of America. It will have a reform effect, because you can't project what may be. When you're promising dividends, you've got to project what is. And that's going to be good for investors, and it's going to be good for accountability when it comes to the corporate sector of America.;So this is the plan I'm asking Congress to look at. It's a reasonable plan, it's a stimulative plan, it's a plan that makes sense. And I'm asking for your help. I'd like for you to contact your Congressman or your Senator and let him know that this plan makes sense for the economic vitality of this country.;We continue to face a hurdle with our schools. If you want America to be a hopeful place, we better make sure the public school system of America works. And so I want to continue—I say we face a problem because not every school is working the way we want it to. I proposed reform which the Senate and the House passed in my first year as the President. The reform said, if you spend money, then it makes sense to demand results. We spend money at the Federal level. Therefore we ought to ask, what are the results? We're asking the simple question, "If you receive money, can the children read and write and add and subtract?" That's what we want to know.;It's really important for Latino parents to have that question asked. It's essential to ask that question if you want the future of this country to be bright, because oftentimes the Latino child just gets passed through the system without asking the fundamental question of whether or not that child can read and write and add and subtract.;You see, it's oftentimes easy to walk into a classroom full of the so-called "hard to educate" and say, "We're moving you through." It's what I call the soft bigotry of low expectations. I told the American people when I was running for office, "I will challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations, because I believe every child can learn, regardless of the status of their parents." And we have done that. We have done that. We've increased Federal education spending by 50 percent from the time I got here. But more importantly, we're demanding accountability because we believe in the value of every child, and we don't want one child left behind here in America.;We look forward to working with you on health care matters. We want the Medicare system to function well. We want to make sure that there is a capacity for people to get primary care through community health centers. It's an initiative which I strongly support and I'm pushing Congress to fund to its fullest. We want to make sure that there is a—health tax credits to help the working uninsured. And we want to make sure there's medical liability reform to make sure that health care is not only affordable but available. In other words, we don't want our docs sued to the point where they're leaving the profession, where people can't find good medical care. There's a lot we can work with you on, and intend to do—associated health care plans, incredibly important part of making sure small-business owners can provide affordable health care to their employees.;I also want to work with—continue to work with you all in America on making sure that our welfare system is complete. I say complete because the best welfare programs oftentimes are those found in our iglesias, our churches and synagogues and mosques. And our Government must not fear the power of faith in our society but must welcome faith-based programs which exist to heal hearts and provide hope for broken lives.;The great strength of this country lies in the hearts of our fellow citizens. The great power of transformation in neighborhoods can take place because thousands of citizens have heard the universal call to love a neighbor like they would like to be loved themself. And so you'll see us continue to work with our neighborhood helpers and healers at the Federal level to encourage faith-based programs to flourish and exist.;I recognize that one person can't solve all of our society's problems, but one person can help save one life. And it's that accumulative effect, what I call the gathering momentum of millions of acts of kindness which take place on a daily basis, which literally can transform this country, one heart and one soul at a time.;I also want to talk to you about how to make sure our judiciary works well. It starts with me naming good people to serve on the bench, good, solid, honest, decent Americans who are willing to forgo the private practice of law, the comforts of private life, and serve on the Federal bench. And that's exactly what I've done. I've named some incredibly fine Americans to serve in this important part of our Government, and no finer American as Miguel Estrada. He is a man I have named, nominated for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. When confirmed, he'll be the first Hispanic to serve on what they call the second most important court in America.;His story is the American story. His story—it's what makes this country so profound and so hopeful and so promising. After all, he came to the country from Honduras. He could barely speak English. He came as a teenage boy, had trouble with our native language, and yet ends up shortly thereafter in Harvard Law School as one of the top students. It speaks about a man who has a dream and works hard to achieve that dream, understands the value of education, overcame difficulties, and became one of the top law students out of Harvard.;He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. He has taken his knowledge and capacity and argued before the highest court of our land. He has served in the Justice Department under Presidents from both political parties. He is a incredibly bright mind.;Yet, his nomination is being delayed and stalled by Democratic Senators. His nomination has been stalled for 2 years. They're blocking the vote on this good man for purely political reasons. The Senators are applying a double standard to Miguel Estrada by requiring him to answer questions that other judicial nominees over time have not been forced to answer. And that is not right, and that is not fair.;By blocking a vote on Miguel Estrada, some Democrats in the Senate are flaunting the intention of the United States Constitution and the tradition of the United States Senate itself. Alexander Hamilton wrote that the purpose of the Senate confirmation was to prevent the appointment of unfit characters. No one can possibly call Miguel Estrada "unfit." The American Bar Association has given him its highest ratings—highest ratings. And he has the qualifications and the experience and the temperament to make an outstanding judge.;The partisans in the Senate are subjecting Miguel Estrada to an unfair double standard. Failing to allow an up-or-down vote—a vote which will pass—on Miguel Estrada's nomination is a travesty, an injustice being carried out by those responsible for helping to uphold justice in this country.;I want to thank you for your work on Miguel's nomination. I will stand by that man's side until he is sworn in as a judge.;And finally, we have been called to defend America and to keep the peace. We face a significant challenge, and that is to protect the homeland of the American people. Prior to September the 11th, 2001, we thought oceans would protect the homeland of the American people. We thought that history would continue to repeat itself, that this Nation was safe and secure, that if there was a gathering threat overseas, we could deal with it if we felt like dealing with it, but it was not a problem for the home people. Yet, on September the 11th, the world changed. It changed dramatically and sadly for thousands of citizens. It also changed for how this country must view our position in the world. The strategic vision of the country shifted.;We're doing everything we can here at home to secure the homeland. We've got agencies working overtime, people sharing information. Our borders are becoming more efficient. We want people, commerce to move freely, but we don't want terrorists to move freely. So we're doing as good a job as we possibly can to protect you. But the best way to secure the homeland is to find killers before they kill us and bring them to justice. And that's what we're going to do.;So we're on the hunt, on Al Qaida. This is a different kind of war. It's a war which requires a good intelligence-sharing, and it requires cutting off money. It requires specially skilled troops to smoke these people out of their caves and to bring them to justice. And that's what we're doing, one by one. Sometimes you'll see success, and sometimes you won't. You've just got to know the mighty United States, along with 89 other countries in our coalition for Enduring Freedom, are doing everything we can to protect you and protect other people who love freedom.;There's also a threat gathering in Iraq. It's been gathering for a long period of time. The danger with Iraq is that he can strike in the neighborhood. And the danger with Iraq is that he has got the willingness and capacity to train Al Qaida-type organizations and provide them with equipment to hurt America.;The world has waited a long time for Mr. Saddam Hussein to disarm. They've waited a long time. He is a master of disguise and delay. He'll say, "Oh, I'm disarming," after he said he has no arms.;We will continue to work with our friends, people who understand the value of freedom. We will insist that the United Nation Resolution 1441 be adhered to in its fullest. After all, we want the United Nations to be a legitimate, effective body. But for the safety of the American people and for peace in the world, Saddam Hussein will be disarmed one way or the other. And this Nation does so for the sake of peace.;The use of our military is the absolute last option. It is the last alternative for the President. But the risk of doing nothing, the risk of assuming that Saddam Hussein will change, the risk of thinking and hoping for the best for the American people, far outweighs the risk of committing troops if we have to. The choice is Saddam Hussein's to make. It's been his to make all along. He gets to choose between peace and war.;And the other thing that is an inherent part of our view of Iraq is how I started the discussion here. See, we believe everybody matters, everybody counts. It doesn't matter your background, where you're from, everybody has worth. As I said in my State of the Union Address, liberty is not America's gift to the world, liberty is God's gift to human—to the human—mankind. And that's what we believe.;So in the days ahead, as we deal with this challenge facing our country, you need to know that the value of freedom and liberty will be at the forefront of a policy designed to make the world more peaceful and a policy designed to protect the American people.;Thank you for your interest. May God bless you all, and may God bless America.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at the Signing Ceremony for Legislation to Implement the Chile and Singapore Free Trade Agreements</td><td class="c6">September 3, 2003</td><td class="c7">Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. I'm honored to welcome you to the White House, and I'm pleased that you could join us today as the United States takes an important step to promote economic growth, to bring lower prices to American consumers, and to generate high-wage jobs for American workers.;With the agreements I sign today, America's economic relationships with Chile and Singapore will be based on free trade, and we will be bound even closer to two of our good friends. The benefits will flow to all our countries. And by these agreements, we are moving toward a great goal, a world that trades in freedom in the Western Hemisphere, in Asia, and beyond. I want to thank all those who worked so hard to complete these agreements. I commend the Members of the Congress for moving quickly to approve this implementing legislation.;I'm pleased to be joined by members of my Cabinet who have worked hard on these agreements and are working hard on future agreements to be passed. Secretary of State Powell is doing a fabulous job on behalf of the American people, Secretary Ann Veneman of the Department of Agriculture, Secretary Don Evans, Department of Commerce, and our Trade Representative, Bob Zoellick.;I also appreciate the Members of Congress who are up here with me today, Senators Hatch and Baucus, as well as Chairman Bill Thomas, David Dreier, and Phil Crane from the House of Representatives, good, strong Members of the Senate and the House who have worked closely with this administration to create an environment for economic growth and high-wage jobs through free trade.;I also welcome other Members of the Senate and the House who are with us today. Thank you all for coming. The stage just wasn't big enough for you. [ Laughter ];I appreciate Ambassador Bianchi from Chile and also Ambassador Heng Chee Chan from Singapore. I appreciate you all coming. I want to thank the representatives of the business community who are here with us today.;We support free trade in America because it is vital to the creation of jobs. It's vital to the success of our economy. Exports accounted for roughly one quarter—one quarter—of our economy's growth in the 1990s.;Jobs and exporting plants pay wages that average up to 18 percent more than jobs in nonexporting plants. Over the past decade, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round have raised the standards of living of the average American family of four by up to $2,000 a year. Free trade is important for the American citizen. The continued advance of free trade is essential to this Nation's prosperity.;The United States also supports free trade because a world that trades in freedom will grow in prosperity and in security. For developing nations, free trade tied to economic reform has helped to lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. The growth of economic freedom and ownership in developing countries creates the habits of liberty and creates the pressure for democracy and political reform. Economic integration through trade can also foster political cooperation by promoting peace between nations. As free trade expands across the Earth, the realm of human freedom expands with it.;When Congress passed trade promotion authority last year, I promised to use that tool aggressively to open up new markets for American exporters and to help create high-paying jobs for American workers, and we moved. I want to thank Ambassador Zoellick and his team from all across our administration for getting to work right away, and we've seen results.;The free trade agreement with Chile is our first ever with a South American country. The agreement will benefit many American industries, including agriculture and construction equipment, autos and auto parts, computers, medical equipment, paper products, and financial services. American-made heavy machinery, such as a motor grader, costs $11,220 more in Chile because of extra tariffs. If that machinery were made in Canada or the European Union, it would carry no tariff. Our trade agreement with Chile will eliminate these kinds of tariffs, and our manufacturers will be able to compete on a level playing field. And as we sell that heavy equipment into Chile, somebody is more likely to find work in America in a good, high-paying job.;The agreement with Chile also includes new protections for intellectual property, a secure legal framework for U.S. investors, and strong provisions for protecting labor and the environment. For decades, Chile has proven the power of open trade and sound policies. It has become one of the strongest economies in the developing world. By establishing free trade with the world's largest economy, Chile will have the opportunity to advance even further and to help make the entire region more prosperous.;The agreement between the United States and Singapore is also historic, the first between the United States and an Asia-Pacific country. Singapore is already America's 12th-largest trading partner and imports a full range of American products, from machine parts and computers to agricultural products. This agreement will increase access to Singapore's dynamic markets for America's exporters and service providers and investors. The agreement contains state-of-the-art protections for Internet commerce and intellectual property that will help drive growth and innovation in our technology sectors. There are also strong labor and environmental protections in our agreement with Singapore.;I signed this legislation today fully expecting to sign many more free trade agreements. We're now negotiating with Australia and Morocco, five nations in Central America, and the Southern African Customs Union. Soon we will begin negotiations with Bahrain and the Dominican Republic. We're working with 33 other nations in our hemisphere to create the Free Trade Area of the Americas. We're encouraging the free flow of commerce and investment among our partners in APEC and ASEAN and hope to build on the success of our trade agreements with Jordan and Israel by establishing a U.S.-Middle East free trade area within a decade to create new opportunity and new hope in a region that needs both.;The greatest gains from world trade will come from completing the World Trade Organization's global negotiations. We made good progress since the negotiations started nearly 2 years ago, and WTO members can build on this progress next week in Cancun, Mexico. Completing the global negotiations by the 2005 deadline is essential, because opening global markets is a pathway to economic success for rich and poor nations alike. The spread of free trade reflects this Nation's convictions. We believe in the dignity of every human being. We believe in freedom.;Free trade also serves the interests of the United States. It serves in the interest of our workers. We will benefit from more trading partners around the world. We want our partners to grow in wealth. We want them to grow in freedom. Chile and Singapore are examples of economic liberty and demonstrate the great promise of trade. I'm honored to sign into law these two pieces of legislation implementing our free trade agreements with our friends Chile and Singapore.</td></tr>

Bush: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for 2004</td><td class="c6">September 15, 2003</td><td class="c7">Presidential Determination No. 2003-38;Memorandum for the Secretary of State;Subject: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for 2004;Consistent with section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (the "FRAA"), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Thailand, Venezuela, and Vietnam.;The Majors List applies by its terms to "countries." The United States Government interprets the term broadly to include entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that could lead to a decision to place them on the list and, subsequently, to determine their eligibility for certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.;Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing country set forth in section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the "FAA"), one of the reasons that major drug-transit or drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures. Consistent with section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and Haiti as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are justifications (statements of explanation) for each of the countries so designated, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that provision of U.S. assistance to Haiti in FY 2004 is vital to the national interests of the United States.;Combating the threat of synthetic drugs remains a priority, particularly the threat from club drugs, including MDMA (Ecstasy). Since January, we have redoubled our efforts with The Netherlands, from which the majority of U.S. MDMA seizures originate. I commend the Government of The Netherlands for its efforts to address this scourge, including increased enforcement, improved risk assessment and targeting capabilities of passenger aircraft and cargo, and international cooperation to control precursor chemicals. I urge the Government of The Netherlands to focus its efforts on dismantling the significant criminal organizations responsible for this illicit trade, using all tools available to law enforcement. Continued progress in implementing our joint action plan, developed in March, should have a significant impact on the production and transit of MDMA from The Netherlands to the United States. Although we have seen a stabilization of MDMA use rates domestically, there is an increase in the number of countries in which MDMA is produced and trafficked. We will continue to monitor the threat from synthetic drugs and the emerging trends.;The United States and Canada are both targeted by international trafficking organizations. We continue to work closely with the Government of Canada to stem the flow of illicit drugs to our countries and across our common borders. The United States remains concerned about the diversion of large quantities of precursor chemicals from Canada into the United States for use in producing methamphetamines. We hope that Canada's newly implemented control regulations will disrupt that flow. The United States is also concerned about widespread Canadian cultivation of high-potency marijuana, significant amounts of which are smuggled into the United States from Canada. We will work with the Government of Canada in the coming year to combat these shared threats to the security and health of our citizens.;In the 8 months since my January determination that Guatemala had failed demonstrably in regard to its counternarcotics responsibilities, the Government of Guatemala has made efforts to improve its institutional capabilities, adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements, and take measures set forth in U.S. law. These initial steps show Guatemala's willingness to better its counternarcotics practices, but the permanence of these improvements has yet to be demonstrated. I expect Guatemala to continue its efforts and to demonstrate further progress in the coming year.;We are deeply concerned about heroin and methamphetamine linked to North Korea being trafficked to East Asian countries, and are increasingly convinced that state agents and enterprises in the DPRK are involved in the narcotics trade. While we suspect opium poppy is cultivated in the DPRK, reliable information confirming the extent of opium production is currently lacking. There are also clear indications that North Koreans traffic in, and probably manufacture, methamphetamine. In recent years, authorities in the region have routinely seized shipments of methamphetamine and/or heroin that had been transferred to traffickers' ships from North Korean vessels. The April 2003 seizure of 125 kilograms of heroin smuggled to Australia aboard the North Korean-owned vessel "Pong Su" is the latest and largest seizure of heroin pointing to North Korean complicity in the drug trade. Although there is no evidence that narcotics originating in or transiting North Korea reach the United States, the United States is intensifying its effort to stop North Korean involvement in illicit narcotics production and trafficking and to enhance law-enforcement cooperation with affected countries in the region to achieve that objective.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;George W.

Bienvenidos. Mi casa es su casa. I want to thank you all for coming to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.;You know, this Nation is blessed by the talents and the hard work of Hispanic Americans, and we're really blessed by the values of familia y fe that strengthen our Nation on a daily basis. It is fitting we honor Hispanic Americans in our country. It's part of our country—an incredibly important part of our country. I also think it's fitting that the way to honor Hispanic Americans is to revel in the vitality of the Hispanic culture that was displayed today, the music that honors the roots, the rhythm, the life of the Latino.;I appreciate my Ambassador to Mexico, Tony Garza. He's been a long-time friend. He was the secretary of state in the State of Texas. It gave him a chance to learn diplomacy. [ Laughter ] He's a great man and a great friend.;I have asked people from Hispanic heritage to join my administration: Hans Hertell, who is the Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, is with us. Hans brought his family with him. [ Laughter ];I've got a Cabinet Secretary de Cuba, who is Mel Martinez. I don't know if you know Mel's story. This speaks volumes about our Nation and about Mel's upbringing. In the early sixties, Cuban parents were worried about their sons growing, their daughters growing up in tyranny. They were afraid about what it would be like for a child to grow up in a world in which terror reigned and there was no freedom. And so Mel's parents put him on an airplane destined for the United States of America.;Imagine the choice of a parent—I would daresay there's really only one country, though, that a parent would be feeling comfortable of sending their child to, and that's America, because of what we stand for. Mel is Pedro Pan. He is now in the Cabinet of the President of the United States, which speaks volumes about you, Mel, and volumes about our country as well.;Hector Barreto is with us today, runs the SBA. Where are you, Hector? Donde esta? Thank you, Hector. Everybody needs to have a good abogado. [ Laughter ] I've got a really good one. [ Laughter ] Al Gonzales is my lawyer and close friend. Eduardo Aguirre is the Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services. Welcome, Eduardo. Gaddi Vasquez— donde esta, Gaddi? Where is he? Peace Corps, running the Peace Corps. He's out recruiting new members. [ Laughter ] Adonde? Oh, yes, there he is. Gaddi got here a little late. [ Laughter ] I want to thank these folks for serving our administration so well.;We've got ambassadors from around the world here with us today. I am honored that Embajador Jose—Juan Jose Bremer de Mexico esta aqui. Good to see you, Jose. Hugo Guiliani de el Dominican Republic. Senor Embajador. Luis Alberto Moreno Mejia de Colombia. Embajador Rene Leon from El Salvador, good to see you, sir. Francisco Javier Ruperez de Espana. Murilo Gabrielli, who is the Deputy Chief of Mission from Brazil, thank you for coming, Murilo.;I'm so honored that Members of the United States Congress are here with us today. The Senator from the great State of Texas—I emphasize "the great State of Texas"—John Cornyn. The chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Conference, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida. Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida is with us. Devin Nunes from California— donde esta Devin? It's an old trick here in Washington, get your name on the roster, but don't show up.

From Arizona, Rick Renzi is with us. And finally, from New Mexico, Steve Pearce. Thank you for coming. I want to thank you all for being here. It's a good sign that Members of the Congress take an interest in the Hispanic Heritage Month. And I appreciate you coming.;I also want to thank Brian Sandoval, who is the attorney general from the State of Nevada. It's awfully kind for him to come all the way over here. Brian, thank you, sir.;I am so pleased that my friend Emilio Estefan is here. Emilio helps put this event on. Emilio puts this event on—or helps us put this event on every year. And it's awfully kind of you to do this. It's good to see you.;I am also honored that Lisa Guerrero is with us. Lisa, thank you very much for serving as the emcee. I appreciate you being on TV on Monday nights too. [ Laughter ];Carlos Ponce—thank you for coming, Carlos. I appreciate you, Carlos. It's good to see you again. It's good to see you on Monday night as well.;I'm so honored that Father Cutie is here. Thank you very much for leading us in the blessing.;Bacilos, thank you, guys, for being the young stars. The Ambassador turned to me and said, "These are the young dudes, the young stars of the music scene." [ Laughter ] I can see why. Congratulations. Thank you for your leadership.;Alexandre, thank you very much. Fantastic. You know, Alexandre, I love your spirit. It's clear to see your heart and soul, and thank you very much. You were good tambien, mi amigo de Puerto Rico. What a voice. Thank you very much.;I am—let me see. I'm probably going to leave somebody out here as we get moving through here. Victor, thank you. Awesome job. I appreciate you coming.;Obviously, the person who invited the guest list here knows I love baseball. We've got a lot of the baseball stars here. I do love baseball. One of my favorite baseball players of all time is a person who's going to be in the Hall of Fame, and that's Rafael Palmeiro of the Texas Rangers. I want to thank you for coming. And Lynne is here. Thank you for coming, Lynne.;I'm glad you brought your manager with you. He's not exactly a Latino ballplayer, but he's a fine guy, and that's Buck Showalter. Thank you for coming, Buck, and thank you for bringing your family. It's good to see you all.;Magglio Ordonez of the Chicago White Sox is with us. Where are you, Magglio? Yes, thank you, buddy.

I knew you'd make it all along. You're probably wondering why I didn't make you general manager of the Rangers, but nevertheless— [ laughter ]—Omar is the general manager of the Montreal Expos. He really does a great job, and I've known Omar a long time. He's a great baseball guy. More important, he's a good person. I'm really proud to have you here.;Just to show you that we're multisport people here, it is my honor to welcome Carlos Arroyo. Carlos, I want to thank you very much for coming. He's the basketball player for the Utah Jazz. Carlos.;Katie, thank you very much for leading us in the anthem. You've got a beautiful voice. You've got a lot of poise and a lot of talent, and we're honored that you're here with us today. Thanks for coming. We're really glad you're here. And thanks for bringing your little brother. I hope he's nice to you all the time. [ Laughter ];The contributions of the Hispanic community have made this country stronger and better. Today we honor the contributions with the entertainment we had here in the East Room. I don't know if you know this, but this is a common occurrence for the Bush administration, to honor men and women of Hispanic descent, to honor their presence and listen to their talents. But this has happened throughout the years in the White House.;There's been some interesting moments here. Pablo Casals was a Spanish-born cellist. He lived in Puerto Rico. He performed for two Presidents—catch this—the first was Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 and the second was John Kennedy in 1961—57 years in between his first and second visit. Nevertheless, he graced this room and this house.;We've also had Jose Limon. He's a modern dancer—Edward Villella to my family's friend Gloria Estefan. You should have brought her. [ Laughter ];One Hispanic entertainer we remember in a special way today is the Queen of Salsa, Celia Cruz. She was an unforgettable performer who fled Cuba in 1960. She became a U.S. citizen and spent the rest of her life sharing the rhythms of her homeland with people all around the world. Celia Cruz passed away 3 months ago. We miss her, and we honor today to welcome her husband, Pedro. Bienvenidos.;We are not only blessed with the culture of the Hispanic in America, we're also blessed by the fact that our country is strengthened because of the spirit of hard work and enterprise. It's part of the Latino culture. We see the spirit in thousands of small businesses and the careers of business people all across our country. One of the most vibrant parts of our economy is the small-business sector, and one of the vibrant parts of the small-business sector is the Latinos who own small businesses, really one of the great success stories of America.;Tell you a story about Lou Sobh, who is with us today. In 1960, he left Mexico, no money, and he couldn't speak the language. He came to America. He didn't— he couldn't speak the language at all, so he worked, and he taught himself English. He ended up becoming a janitor in a department store, a hard worker. He had a dream, and he was working toward his dream. He served in the United States Army. He got out of the Army, and he had a dream to open up his own car dealership. Today, he owns 14—not one car dealership but 14 car dealerships. He employs 800 people. He's got three car franchises in Mexico. He's living proof of the American Dream—an incredibly important part of our Nation, the Latino spirit of hard work and drive and enterprise. And Lou, I want to congratulate you for being a success and setting an example. Thank you for coming, sir.;Today, as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we also must take pride in the generations of Hispanic Americans who have served in America's Armed Forces, served to protect and defend a nation they love. Forty-two Hispanic Americans—42— cuarenta y dos —have earned the highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor. That's a lot. Today, men and women of Hispanic heritage continue to serve and sacrifice in the defense of freedom. They have our respect, and they have our gratitude.;Earlier this year, at the National Naval Medical Center, I had an amazing experience. Eduardo was there. I had the chance and privilege of meeting a patriot, Master Gunnery Sergeant Guadalupe Denogean. Sergeant Denogean is an immigrant from Mexico. He has served in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Last spring, he was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq, and he was sent back for treatment. They asked Sergeant Denogean, did he have any requests? He said he had two. He wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and the second request is he wanted to be an American citizen.;I was there the day Sergeant Denogean took his oath of citizenship. Eduardo administered the oath. In a hospital where he was recovering, this son of Mexico raised his right hand and pledged to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. What made that moment amazing to me is that he had kept that oath for decades before he took it. I'm proud of the sergeant. I'm proud to call him citizen. I'm proud to call him fellow citizen to America.;Through the lives of people like Sergeant Denogean and Lou and Celia Cruz, it is clear that the American Dream belongs to todos. It's for everybody, not just a few. And that's the greatness of our country. It's the spirit of America. And it's important that this generation and future generations keep that dream alive.;We've got to make sure that hard work is a place that is respected and rewarded. We must make sure that our entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs from all walks of life have the opportunity to dream and work hard and realize their ambitions. We must make sure that the dream of homeownership is available for every citizen in our country. We must make sure that every child gets educated, that the public schools educate every single child, those whose parents may speak English, those whose parents may not yet speak English. Education belongs to everybody. High standards belongs to everybody. We must challenge the soft bigotry of low expectations in American public schools.;We're proud of our country. We're a strong country. We're militarily strong, and I'll keep us that way. But our wealth isn't really found in our military or our pocketbooks. The true strength of America is found in the character of the American people, in the courage of the people, the creativity of our people, and in the compassion of our people.;As Governor, and now as President, I've seen the character of America and the character of millions of Hispanic Americans who make our Nation a better place. The warmth and the vitality of the Hispanic culture, the energy and faith of Hispanic men and women are great gifts to America.;I want to thank you all for coming to celebrate those gifts. Que Dios los bendiga a todos, y que Dios bendiga a los Estados Unidos. Thank you for coming.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Bush-Cheney Reception in Fresno, California</td><td class="c6">October 15, 2003</td><td class="c7">Thanks for the warm welcome. It's great to be back in California. It's great to be back in Fresno. I was trying to figure out, since I've been running for President, this is either my third or fourth time here. And every time I come, I'm better off for it. [ Laughter ] It kind of reminds me of where I was raised—good people, except you've got water and trees. [ Laughter ];I know there's been some interesting changes here in the State of California. [ Laughter ] And tomorrow I have the honor of congratulating the Governor-elect in Riverside. And today I want to thank you all for your contributions and for your support. See, what we're doing is, we're laying the groundwork for what is going to be a great national victory in 2004.;I want you to know that your contributions are important, but so is your grass-roots support. And by that I mean, when you go to the coffee shop—and I know there's a lot of farmers here who go to the coffee shops—[ laughter ]—tell everybody, or when you go to your community centers or your places of worship, you tell them that this administration is dedicating its efforts to making sure our country is hopeful for every citizen, that our message is optimistic, because we believe in the future of this country. That's what I'm counting on you to do.;And I'll do my part, but the political season is going to come in its own time. I'm warming up, and I'm getting ready, but I've got a job to do. I've got a job to do for our country, and there's a lot on the agenda. And I'm going to continue to work hard to earn the confidence of every American, regardless of their political party or where they're from, by keeping this Nation strong and secure and prosperous and free.;I bring greetings from First Lady Laura Bush. She is—[ applause ]—you got the B team. [ Laughter ] She has been in the Dominican Republic recently, meeting with the First Ladies of the different countries in our hemisphere. I'll be meeting her tomorrow in Riverside as we take off to Tokyo, and I'll be getting some advice from her about diplomacy. [ Laughter ] You may remember the picture of her trip to France. [ Laughter ] I went to France. [ Laughter ] And they were kind to me, but they—I wasn't treated that way by Jacques Chirac. [ Laughter ] But she is great. I am a lucky man that she agreed to marry me, and she's a fabulous First Lady.;I appreciate my friend Brad Freeman, who is the State finance chairman. I appreciate my friend Mercer Reynolds from Cincinnati, Ohio, who is the national finance chairman. These are two very capable, able business people who are taking time out of their lives to make sure this campaign is well funded.;I want to thank Members of the Congress who are here. George Radanovich is with us today. He is a good friend and a fine Congressman, as is Devin Nunes, and I appreciate Devin being here as well.;I had the honor of traveling from the airport out to Ruiz Foods, by the way, which was a fantastic experience, going out there. I love the story of America. I love the fact that people started with nothing and have built a fantastic food processing business. The Ruizes are here with us today. They were great hosts. They now process 3 million burritos a day. Are you having burritos for lunch?;But on the way out to the facility, Alan Autry was traveling with me, the great mayor of Fresno, California. And I appreciate him being here today, and I thank him for his friendship. Chuck Poochigian is here, the State senator, who's been a longtime friend of mine. And it's great to see his wife, Debbie. Bob Waterston is the supervisor of the Fresno County Board of Supervisors—all politics is local politics, and thank you for coming, Bob. My friend Bill Jones is here. He's a Fresno lad who has made a name for himself here in the great State of California. It's great to see you again, Bill. Thank you for coming.;Gerry Parsky is with us today, he's the State campaign chairman. Rosario Marin is with us today, the former Treasurer of the State—of the country. I want to thank all the cohosts for working so hard to make this event a recordbreaking event.;I appreciate Lance Corporal Nolan Cochran, who gave the Pledge of Allegiance. He's a brave young guy. He served his country with distinction. I had the honor of meeting him at the Bethesda Naval Hospital as he came back from the battlefields. And I was pleased to see his mom and dad. I'm glad to know his spirits are high and that he understands that he was making our country more secure in his sacrifice.;And finally, I want to thank JoAnna Dias, who sang the national anthem.;In the last 2 1/2 years, our Nation has acted decisively to confront great challenges. I came to this office to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Presidents and future generations. I came to seize opportunities and not let them slip away. This administration is meeting the tests of our time.;Terrorists declared war on the United States of America, and war is what they got. We've captured or killed many of the key leaders of the Al Qaida network, and the rest of them know that we're on their trail. In Afghanistan and Iraq, we gave ultimatums to terror regimes. Those regimes chose defiance, and those regimes are no more. Fifty million people in those two countries once lived under tyranny, and now they live in freedom.;Two-and-a-half years ago, our military was not receiving the resources it needed, and morale was beginning to suffer. And so we increased the defense budgets to prepare for the threats of a new era. And today, no one in the world can question the skill and the strength and the spirit of the United States military.;Two-and-a-half years ago, we inherited an economy in recession. And then the attacks came on our country, and we had a march to war to defend ourselves, and we had scandals in corporate America, all of which affected the people's confidence. But this administration acted. We passed two tough new laws to hold corporate criminals to account. And to get the economy going again, I have twice led the United States Congress to pass historic tax relief for the American people.;Here's what I know. I know that when people have more take-home pay, more money in their pocket to save or to spend or invest, the whole economy will grow and someone is more likely to find a job. I also know this: I understand whose money we spend in Washington. We don't spend the people's money—I mean, we don't spend the Government's money, we spend the people's money. [ Laughter ] So we're returning more money to families. We've increased the child credit. And we said, "The check was in the mail," and it was in the mail. We reduced the taxes on dividends and capital gains to encourage investment. We gave small businesses incentives to expand and to hire new people.;With all these actions, by the fact—because we led, we are laying the foundation for greater prosperity and more jobs so that every single person in this country has a chance to realize the American Dream.;Two-and-a-half years ago, there was a lot of talk about education reform, but there wasn't much action. So I acted. I called for and the Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act. With a solid bipartisan majority, we delivered the most dramatic education reforms in a generation. We insisted on high standards for every public school because we believe every child can learn.;Because we believe every child can learn, we're now saying that in return for Federal money, you must measure to determine whether every child is learning. We're challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. We believe every child can learn the basics of reading and math. And we expect every public school in America to teach reading and math so that not one single child is left behind.;We reorganized our Government, the largest reorganization of any time in our Government's history since the Defense Department was reorganized. We created the Department of Homeland Security to better safeguard America.;We passed trade promotion authority to open up new markets for California farmers and ranchers and entrepreneurs. Listen, I understand free trade, and the cornerstone of free trade is not only for us to open up our markets but to make sure the playing field is level. We're really good at growing things in California. I want California farmers selling their crops overseas.;We passed budget agreements in Washington that is helping to maintain spending discipline. On issue after issue, this administration has acted on principle, we have kept our word, and we have made progress for the American people.;The Congress deserves credit. We've got a great Speaker in Denny Hastert and a great majority leader in Bill Frist. I appreciate the Congressmen who are here with us today. See, we're working to change the tone in Washington. There's too much politics in the Nation's Capital, too much zero-sum activity. And the best way to do that is to focus on the people's business and to focus on results. And those are the kind of people I've attracted to my administration. I think you can judge a President by the kind of people that he brings to Washington to serve the people, and I have put together a great team to serve the American people. We've had no finer Vice President than Dick Cheney. Mother may have a second opinion. [ Laughter ];In 2 1/2 years—in 2 1/2 years—we have done a lot, and we have come far, but our work is only beginning. I have great goals worthy of a great nation.;First, America is committed to expanding the realm of freedom and peace for our own security and for the benefit of the world. And second, in our own country we must work for a society of prosperity and compassion, so that every citizen has a chance to work and succeed and to realize the promise of our country. It is clear that the future of freedom and peace depend on the actions of America. This Nation is freedom's home and freedom's defender. We welcome this charge of history, and we are keeping it.;Our war on terror continues. The enemies of freedom are not idle, and neither are we. This country will not rest. We will not tire. We will not stop until this danger to civilization is removed. And we are confronting that danger in Iraq, where Saddam holdouts and foreign terrorists are desperately trying to throw Iraq into chaos by attacking coalition forces, by attacking international aid workers, and by killing innocent Iraqis. They know that the advance of freedom will be a major defeat in the cause of terror.;This collection of killers is trying to shake the will of the United States. They're trying to frighten us. They do not understand our country. We will not be frightened. We will stay on the offensive. We're aggressively striking the terrorists in Iraq, defeating them there so we will not have to face them in our own country.;We're calling other nations to help Iraq to build a free country. A free and peaceful Iraq will make the world more secure. And we'll stand with the Iraqi people, the long-suffering Iraqi people—they are people who put up with torture chambers and rape rooms and mass graves. We will help them assume more of their own defense and move as rapidly as possible toward self-government. These tasks are not easy, but they are essential tasks. And we will finish what we have begun. We will win this essential victory in the war on terror.;But I understand this: Our greatest security comes from the advance of human liberty, because free nations do not support terror. Free nations do not attack their neighbors. Free nations do not threaten the world with weapons of mass terror. Americans believe that freedom is the deepest need and hope of every human heart. And I believe that freedom is the right of every person. And I believe that freedom is the future of every nation.;America also understands that unprecedented influence brings tremendous responsibilities. We have duties in this world, and when we see disease and starvation and hopeless poverty, we will not turn away. On the continent of Africa, this great Nation, this strong Nation, is committed to bringing the healing power, the healing power of medicine to millions of men and women and children now suffering with AIDS. I am incredibly proud of the fact that this great land is leading the world in the important work of human rescue.;We've got challenges here at home, and our actions will prove equal to those challenges. So long as somebody in our economy—in our country is looking for a job, I will continue to try to create the conditions for job growth, to foster the entrepreneurial spirit, to make it easier for the small businesses who hire most new workers to be able to grow and to expand. I want everybody in this country finding a job.;And we have a duty to keep our commitment to our seniors by strengthening and modernizing Medicare. A few weeks ago, the Congress finally passed some Medicare reform. The House passed a version, and the Senate passed a version. For the first time since the creation of Medicare, both Houses have passed reforms to increase the choices for seniors and to provide a much needed prescription drug benefit. It is time for both bodies to reconcile their differences and to do their duty, not only for today's seniors but for those of us who will be seniors, to modernize the Medicare system.;For the sake of our health care system, we need to cut down on the frivolous lawsuits which increase the cost of medicine. People who have been harmed by a bad doc deserve their day in court. Yet, the system should not reward lawyers who are simply fishing for a rich settlement. Frivolous lawsuits drive up the cost of health care and, therefore, affect the Federal budget: Medicare goes up, Medicaid goes up, veteran health care costs go up because of the frivolous lawsuits. Medical liability reform is a national issue which requires a national solution.;And so I proposed a good, strong piece of legislation. The House passed it. It is stuck in the Senate. The Senate must act on behalf of the American people, and they must hear loud and clear that no one has ever been healed by a frivolous lawsuit.;I have a responsibility as President to make sure the judicial system runs well, and I have met that duty. I have nominated superb men and women for the Federal courts, people who will interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. Some Members of the Senate are trying to keep my nominees off the bench by blocking up-or-down votes. Every judicial nominee deserves a fair hearing and an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. It is time for some of the Members of the United States Senate to stop playing politics with American justice.;Congress needs to complete work on a comprehensive energy plan. This Nation must promote energy efficiency and conservation and develop cleaner technology to help us explore for energy in environmentally sensitive ways. But for the sake of economic security and for the sake of national security, we need to be less dependent on foreign sources of energy.;Our strong and prosperous Nation must also be a compassionate nation. I will continue to advance our agenda of compassionate conservatism by applying the best and most innovative ideas to the task of helping our fellow citizens in need. There are still millions of men and women who want to end their dependence on the Government and become independent through hard work. We must build on the successes of the welfare reform to bring work and dignity into the lives of more of our fellow citizens. Congress should complete the "Citizen Service Act" so more Americans can serve their communities and their country.;And both Houses should reach agreement on my Faith-Based Initiative, so we can support the armies of compassion that are mentoring children, that are caring for the homeless and offering hope to the addicted. Our Government must not fear the influence of faith in our communities. We must welcome faith programs to help solve the intractable problems of our society.;A compassionate society promotes opportunity for all, including the independence and dignity that come from ownership. This administration will constantly strive to promote an ownership society in America. We want more people owning their homes. Today I discussed the minority homeowner-ship gap. I described a plan that we put before Congress to close that gap. We want more people to own and manage their own health care plans. We want people to own and manage their own retirement accounts. We want more people owning their own small business in America, because we understand that when a person owns something, he or she will have a vital stake in the future of this country.;In a compassionate society, people respect one another, and they take responsibility for the decisions they make. We're changing the culture of this country from one that has said, "If it feels good, do it," and "If you've got a problem, blame somebody else," to one in which each of us understands that we are responsible for the decisions we make. If you are fortunate enough to be a mother or father, you're responsible for loving your child with all your heart. If you're concerned about the quality of the education in the community in which you live, you're responsible for doing something about it. If you're a CEO in America, you have a responsibility to tell the truth to your shareholders and your employees. And in this new responsibility society, each of us is responsible for loving our neighbor just like we'd like to be loved ourselves.;We see the culture of service and responsibility growing around us. Right after September the 11th, I started the USA Freedom Corps to encourage Americans to extend a compassionate hand to a neighbor in need, and the response has been strong. Our charities are strong. Our faith-based organizations are vibrant. Police and firefighters and people who wear our Nation's uniform are reminding us what it means to sacrifice for something greater than yourself. Once again, the children of America believe in heroes, because they see them every day.;In these challenging times, the world has seen the resolve and the courage of America. And I have been privileged to see the compassion and the character of the American people. All the tests of the last 2 1/2 years have come to the right nation. We're a strong country, and we use that strength to defend the peace. We're an optimistic country, confident in ourselves and in ideals bigger than ourselves. Abroad, we seek to lift whole nations by spreading freedom. At home, we seek to lift up lives by spreading opportunity to every corner of America. This is the work that history has set before us. We welcome it. And we know that for our country and for our cause, the best days lie ahead.;Thank you for coming. God bless. Thank you all.</td></tr>

I appreciate your hospitality. I appreciate your friendship, and thank you for your strong support. I'm proud to have it.;I understand there's been a couple of changes here in California since I was last time here. And tomorrow at the Mission Inn, I have the opportunity to congratulate the Governor-elect of the great State of California, and I'm looking forward to it.;I'll tell you what we're doing here tonight. We're laying the foundation for what is going to be a great national victory in 2004. And I appreciate you being on the team and want to tell you that I'm going to continue to count on your support when you go to your houses of worship or your community centers or your coffee shops, and you tell the people who haven't made up their mind yet that this administration will continue to work for what's right and best for every single American.;The political season is going to come in its own time. I am kind of loosening up— [ laughter ]—and getting ready. But I've got a job to do. I'm focused on the people's business, and there's a lot on the agenda in Washington, DC. I will continue to work hard to earn the confidence of all Americans by keeping this Nation strong and secure and prosperous and free.;My one regret is that Laura isn't with me tonight. That's your regret too, I know. [ Laughter ] You kind of got the short straw. [ Laughter ] She was in the Dominican Republic today and is flying out. Tomorrow we'll meet at March Air Force Base, and then we're on a very exciting journey to Asia. I'm proud that she's going to be on my side. I'm going to get a few pointers from her about diplomacy. [ Laughter ] You might remember that she recently took a trip to France. [ Laughter ] You probably saw the picture of her visit there. [ Laughter ] I went to France. [ Laughter ] The people were nice to me, but I certainly wasn't treated that well by Jacques Chirac. [ Laughter ] Laura is great. I'm really lucky that she's my wife. She's a great First Lady for our country.;I appreciate very much two Members of the United States Congress coming today. I know they flew out for this event. They're leaving in the morning for votes tomorrow, and that's Congressman Ken Calvert from this district—I appreciate you, Ken—and Congresswoman Mary Bono from the great State of California. Thank you, Mary.;I want to thank my friend Jim Brulte for being here today. I told him if he gets any skinnier, he's going to end up in a Subway ad. [ Laughter ] But I appreciate his leadership. He's a great minority leader of the State senate, the cochairman of this event. I also thank State Senator Dennis Hollingsworth who is here. I appreciate you coming, Senator. Jim Battin is here, another State senator. I appreciate you coming, Jim. Thank you. Ray Haynes, another State senator, is here. Pretty soon we're going to get the whole State senate here. [ Laughter ] Bonnie Garcia is a State assemblywoman. Russ Bogh is here with us. Thank you, Russ, for coming. I'm honored you're here. Bob Dutton, John Benoit, members of the statehouse. I want to thank all the local officials who are here, the supervisors and the mayors and—so honored you all are here. I appreciate the folks who have worked so hard to make this such a successful event.;I particularly want to thank my friend Brad Freeman and Gerry Parsky—my friends Brad Freeman and Gerry Parsky, who have been the leaders in this State for my campaign. As well I want to thank my friend Mercer Reynolds from Cincinnati, Ohio, who is the Bush-Cheney national finance chairman. He's taken a lot of time out of his life to make sure this campaign of ours is well-funded. It seems like he's doing a pretty darn good job.;But most of all, thanks to you all again for being here.;You know, in the last 2 1/2 years, our Nation has acted decisively to confront great challenges. I came to this office to solve problems, not to pass them on to future Presidents and future generations. I came to seize opportunities instead of letting them slip away.

We're returning more money to people. We're helping them raise their families. We've reduced capital gains taxes and dividends. We're helping small businesses. When I hear that someone is looking for a job who wants to work and can't find that job, we will continue to work to create an environment that is strong for the entrepreneur. We want the people of America working.;Two-and-a-half years ago, there was a lot of talk about education reform, but there wasn't much action. So I acted. I called for and the Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act. With a solid bipartisan majority, we delivered the most dramatic education reforms in a generation. See, we're bringing high standards to public schools all across America. And we're going to have strong accountability measures to make sure that those standards are met. In return for Federal money, we're now saying to the public schools, "Show us whether our children can read and write and add and subtract. We believe they can. You show us if you're teaching them how to do so." You see, we're challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations. We believe every child can learn. We expect every school to teach so that not one single child is left behind.;We reorganized the Government and created the Department of Homeland Security to better safeguard our borders and better safeguard the American people.

We passed budget agreements that is helping to maintain much needed spending discipline in Washington, DC. On issue after issue, this administration has acted on principle.

It's a great pleasure to work with Speaker Denny Hastert and majority leader Bill Frist. We're working hard to try to change the tone in Washington, DC, by focusing on results, not politics. We want to do what's right for the American people. By the way, those are the kind of people I've called to service in my administration. I have put together a superb team of Americans from all walks of life to serve in the administration. Our Nation has had no finer Vice President than Dick Cheney. Mother may have a second opinion.

We're calling other nations to help Iraq to build a free country, which will make all of us more secure. And we're standing with the Iraqi people as they assume more of their own defense and move toward self-government. These aren't easy tasks, but they are essential tasks.

On the continent of Africa, America is now committed to bringing the healing power of medicine to millions of men and women and children suffering with AIDS. This great Nation is taking the lead. We're leading the world in this incredibly important work of human rescue.;We face challenges here at home as well. I talked about our need to make sure we continue to create the conditions for economic growth and vitality, so people can find work. As well we have a duty to keep our commitment to America's seniors by strengthening and modernizing Medicare. Congress took historic action. For the first time since the creation of Medicare, the House and the Senate passed reforms to increase choices for our seniors and to provide coverage of prescription drugs. The next step is for both Houses to iron out their differences and to get the bill to my desk. The sooner that Congress finishes the job, the sooner American seniors will get the health care they deserve.;And for the sake of our health care system, we need to cut down on the frivolous lawsuits which increase the cost of medicine. People who have been harmed by a bad doc deserve their day in court. Yet the system should not reward lawyers who are simply fishing for a rich settlement.

It is time for some Members of the United States Senate to stop playing politics with American justice.;This country needs a comprehensive energy plan, and the Congress needs to act. This Nation must promote energy efficiency and conservation. We must use technologies to help us find energy in an environmentally sensitive way. But for the sake of economic security and for the sake of national security, we must become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.;A strong and prosperous nation must also be a compassionate nation. I will continue to advance our agenda of compassionate conservatism by applying the best and most innovative ideas to the task of helping our fellow citizens in need. Congress should complete the "Citizen Service Act," so more Americans can serve their communities and their countries.;Both Houses should reach agreement on the Faith-Based Initiative to support the armies of compassion that are mentoring children and caring for the homeless and offering hope to the addicted. This Nation is a great nation because we believe in worshiping freely. This Nation should not fear faith and providing the compassionate help to people who hurt. We should welcome help from the Christian community and the Jewish community and the Muslim community, the Hindu community, to help people find help they need. Love comes from houses of worship. This Government ought to welcome the Faith-Based Initiative.;A compassionate society must promote opportunity for all, including the independence and dignity that come from ownership. This administration will constantly strive to promote an ownership society in America. We want more people to own their homes. We have a minority home-ownership gap in America, and today in Fresno, I discussed ways to narrow that gap.;We want people to own and manage their own health care plan. We want more people to own and manage their own retirement accounts. We want more people to own their own small business. You see, this administration understands that when a person owns something, he or she has a vital stake in the future of our country.;In a compassionate society, people respect one another and take responsibility for the decisions they make. We're changing the culture of America from one that has said, "If it feels good, just go ahead and do it," and "If you've got a problem, blame somebody else," to a culture in which each of us understands we're responsible for the decisions we make in life.;If you are fortunate enough to be a mom or a dad, you're responsible for loving your child with all your heart. If you're worried about the quality of education in the community in which you live, you're responsible for doing something about it. If you're a CEO in corporate America, you're responsible for telling the truth to your employees and your shareholders. And in the new responsibility society, each of us is responsible for loving our neighbor just like we'd like to be loved ourselves.;We see the culture of service and responsibility growing around us here in our country. I started what we call the USA Freedom Corps to encourage Americans to extend a compassionate hand to a neighbor in need, and the response has been strong, just like the response has been strong for charities all across our country and just like the response has been strong in our faith-based institutions. Policemen and firefighters and people who wear our Nation's uniform are reminding us what it means to sacrifice for something greater than yourself. Once again, the children of America believe in heroes, because they see them every day.;In these challenging times, the world has seen the resolve and the courage of America. And I have been privileged to see the compassion and the character of the American people. All the tests of the last 2 1/2 years have come to the right nation. We're a strong country, and we use that strength to defend the peace. We're an optimistic country, confident in ourselves and in ideals bigger than ourselves.;Abroad, we seek to lift whole nations by spreading freedom. At home, we seek to lift up lives by spreading opportunity to every corner of America. This is the work that history has set before us. We welcome it. And we know that for our country and for our cause, the best days lie ahead.;May God bless you all. Thank you very much.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at the Inauguration Ceremony of the Special Summit of the Americas in Monterrey</td><td class="c6">January 12, 2004</td><td class="c7">Mr. President, I thank you for your wonderful hospitality. First Lady, thank you as well. Please thank the people of this gracious city for hosting such a distinguished group of leaders, spouses, citizens of the world.;Two years ago in this city, world leaders formed the Monterrey Consensus. We pledged to work for government that is responsive to the basic needs of every human being and for policies that promote opportunity for all. At this year's summit, we are embracing the challenge of implementing that consensus to bring all the hemisphere's people into an expanding circle of development.;To advance these goals, my Nation revolutionized the way we provide aid, and we substantially increased our aid to developing countries. Under our new Compact for Development, U.S. assistance is linked to good governments, investment in people, and economic freedom. Development assistance should light a path to reform and economic growth rather than perpetuate the need for further aid.;The nations of this hemisphere must identify concrete steps to implement the noble ideas of the Monterrey Consensus. We must work to provide quality education and quality health care for all our citizens, especially for those suffering from HIV/ AIDS. We must also chart a clear course toward a vibrant free market that will help lift people out of poverty and create a healthy middle class. We must increase the credit available to small businesses that generate the majority of jobs in all our economies and reduce the time that it takes to start a business. We must strengthen property rights so that land can be leveraged as a source of capital to start businesses or hire new workers. And we must lower the cost of sending money home to the families of hard-working men and women who are earning a living abroad.;Over the long term, trade is the most certain path to lasting prosperity. The openness of our market is the key driver of growth in the region and a testament to the United States' belief in the mutual benefits of trade. Last year, about 83 percent of Latin America's exports to the United States, roughly $176 billion worth of goods, entered my country duty-free. My country is committed to free and fair trade for this hemisphere through the Free Trade Area of the Americas and through the growing number of bilateral free trade agreements we have completed and are negotiating. Our NAFTA partners have been vital free trade allies for 10 years now.;Our free trade agreement with Chile entered into force on the first of this year. We're completing a free trade agreement with our Central American partners. This week we'll launch negotiations with the Dominican Republic, and soon we'll begin negotiations with Panama and some of our Andean friends. Once completed, these free trade agreements will cover more than two-thirds of the GDP of America's neighbors.;The essential foundations of prosperity and progress remain democracy and the rule of law. All nations must prevail in the fight against corruption. We must deny safe haven to corrupt officials and create a culture of transparency in the Americas. Today I signed a proclamation denying corrupt officials entry into my country. I urge other countries to take similar actions.;At past summits, we resolved that democracy is the only legitimate form of government in this hemisphere and that the peoples of the Americas have an obligation to promote it and defend it. Those governments in our hemisphere that have responded by supporting democracy can be proud. Our unity and support of democratic institutions, constitutional processes, and basic liberties gives hope and strength to those struggling to preserve their God-given rights, whether in Venezuela or Haiti or Bolivia.;And through our democratic example, we must continue to stand with the brave people of Cuba, who for nearly half a century have endured the tyrannies and repression. Dictatorship has no place in the Americas. We must all work for a rapid, peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Together we will succeed, because the spirit of liberty still thrives, even in the darkest corners of Castro's prisons.;We have great opportunities to work together to improve the quality of life for all the people of this hemisphere. To realize our common vision, we must set goals that are specific and measurable. In doing so, we will affirm our determination to succeed and to give hope to millions.;Together we will implement the Monterrey Consensus, lift all our nations, and show the world that free societies and free markets can deliver real benefits to our citizens.;May God bless you all.</td></tr>

By opening new markets for American products and services, bringing lower prices and more choices to American consumers, and attracting foreign companies to invest and hire in the United States, free and fair trade helps create better jobs for American workers. During World Trade Week, we celebrate the benefits trade brings to our citizens, our economy, and to countries and people around the world.;Since World War II, the United States has led the world in advancing trade to create jobs for American workers, increase choice for consumers, and ensure that quality American goods and services are sold on every continent. Today, millions of American jobs depend on our goods and services being sold overseas, and foreign-owned companies and their suppliers employ millions of Americans here at home.;My Administration has aggressively negotiated trade agreements that slash foreign tariffs and remove the barriers to selling American goods and services around the world. Since 2001, we have entered into free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore and concluded negotiations with Australia, Morocco, the Dominican Republic, and five countries in Central America. Free trade agreement negotiations with Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Bahrain, Thailand, and five member countries of the Southern African Customs Union are in progress or about to begin. We are also working with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas that will form the world's largest common market and improve the lives of citizens in America and these countries. By opening foreign markets to American exports and encouraging foreign countries to set up operations in the United States, all of these agreements help create more and better jobs in our Nation. They also help increase prosperity for our workers.;For American businesses and their employees to continue to outperform other countries, America must remain the best place to do business and invest capital. In addition, we must ensure that our citizens are prepared for the high-skilled jobs our economy is creating. By fostering an environment where the entrepreneurial spirit flourishes and by providing workers with the best skills and education in the world, we can maintain our country's economic leadership and help all our citizens achieve a better life.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 16 through May 22, 2004, as World Trade Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate the benefits of trade to our Nation and the global economy.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-eighth.;GEORGE W.

Laura and I are thrilled to have you here. We welcome you to the—to observe Hispanic Heritage Month. What a performance. Thank you all very much. It was spectacular.;This is the month we celebrate great contributions of Latinos to our country. It's a special month. It really echoes our diversity and the strength of our great democracy. I spend a lot of time talking about the transformational power of liberty, reminding people that liberty has got an incredible way of taking diverse people and uniting them into one common purpose— pais, a great land. That's why we believe democracy has a place in our own neighborhood. We believe that liberty is important in countries throughout our hemisphere. We believe in human dignity and human rights, the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity. And that's best achieved through liberty.;That's why we're working to advance liberty in the greater Middle East. We believe all people desire to be free. We believe that inherently in the soul of men and women is this desire to live in free societies. It's worked here in America. It can work everywhere. Think about our country. We're such a diverse land with different cultures all bound together in this great country because of freedom.;You know, recently I talked to President Putin of Russia. I told him this country mourns the loss of life as a result of the terrorist attacks, the terrorist attack on the school. I told him we stand shoulder to shoulder with them in fighting terror, that we abhor men who kill innocent children to try to achieve a dark vision. I'm also concerned about the decisions that are being made in Russia that could undermine democracy in Russia, that great countries, great democracies have a balance of power between central government and local governments, a balance of power within central governments between the executive branch and the legislative branch and the judicial branch. As governments fight the enemies of democracy, they must uphold the principles of democracy.;I also want to say something, as we gather, about Hurricane Ivan. I talked to the Governors of Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana, tambien mi hermano, el Gobernador de Florida. I told him the people of this country—I told all four Governors the people of this country are praying for their safety. We pray that the storm passes as quickly as possible without any loss of life or loss of property, and that— I told them that the Government is ready to help.;I appreciate Hector. I want to thank you for your service. I appreciate Secretary Evans and Secretary Chao, members of my Cabinet who have joined us today. I'm proud of your work.;We've got Ambassadors here. This is an important month, by the way, and we're tracking a lot of big shots. [ Laughter ] Hans Hertell is with us. Hans, thanks for coming.

Eduardo Aguirre is the Director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Al Gonzales is my lawyer. [ Laughter ] He is the White House Counsel to the President. Ruben Barrales is the Director of Intergovernmental Affairs. I'm naming people that work in my administration. I think it's important to promote a diverse administration, to welcome all cultures, and we're better for it here in Washington. And I want to thank them for their service.;I want to thank the Embajador de Colombia y tambien de Mexico y el nuevo Embajador de Espana. Welcome today to the White House for the credentialing ceremony. I want to thank the three Ambassadors for coming. Welcome.

Amado is from Honduras. Bienvenidos. Good luck in the season.;I want to thank members of the Hispanic Organization who are here today.;I do want to make special mention of the fact that Judge Reynaldo Garza of Brownsville, Texas, passed away this week. He was 89 years old. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Judge Garza to the district court in Texas. Judge Garza was one of the first Hispanic Federal judges in America. He's a great Texan. Those of us who are from Texas were proud to say, "We're both Texans." He was the son of Mexican immigrants. He was a shining example of the American Dream. He was a good man, and he made this country a better place, and we honor his memory today.;People often talk about the Latino culture. Here's how I'd like to describe it: faith in God, commitment to family, and love of country. In this moment in our history, America is defending—depending on the unselfish dedication of patriots. Today, there are almost 200,000 Hispanic Americans serving in the Armed Forces. Eight of these incredibly brave men and women are with us today. I want to thank you all for coming. Thank you for wearing the uniform.;Latinos have contributed to the defense of freedom abroad and to the advance of freedom inside our own country. This afternoon, Laura and I were honored to meet members of an Hispanic American family who struggled against discrimination and won a victory for all in this country. We welcome Sylvia and Gonzalo and Jerome and Sandra Mendez with us. Bienvenidos. Let me tell you their story. I think you'll find it so incredibly American and so uplifting.;Sixty years ago, their parents, Gonzalo y Felicitas Mendez, tried to enroll their children as students in a mostly white elementary school closest to their house in Westminister, California. That was 60 years ago. Unfortunately, in those days, America had a—our vision wasn't as clear as it should be. They were turned away from that school, and they went to an older barrio school. I'm told it was a rickety, wooden building bordered by an electric cattle fence. The mom and dad didn't like it. They didn't like their children being treated that way. They loved their children. And so they—and so the dad saved his money, 1945, and he went into a Federal court to sue with four other families for equality and fairness. That's 1945.;He said, "I'm just doing this for my children." What he really meant to say was, "I'm just doing this for every child." He was fighting so that everyone in this country has a chance to realize the American Dream.;A lawyer named Thurgood Marshall filed a friend of the court brief in the lawsuit, and the Mendez family won their case. Their effects reached far beyond a single neighborhood school. Inspired by the Mendez decision, Governor Earl Warren signed an order desegregating all the schools of California. Five years later, Thurgood Marshall would use the same arguments against segregation when he argued Brown versus Board of Education. And Earl Warren, who had become Chief Justice, would write the Supreme Court opinion that ended segregation in schools across America.;Today we honor your family and your mom and dad.;When Laura and I were taking our picture, one of the beautiful girls said— women said the No Child Left Behind Act is great. It's in the spirit of the Mendez family that the No Child Left Behind Act is flourishing, because we're fighting against another kind of discrimination in that act. It's called the soft bigotry of low expectations. We should never allow a system to exist in where they walk into a classroom and say, "This child can't read because of the color of their skin." You can't condemn somebody to failure because their parents don't speak English as a first language. That's not what we stand for here in America.;And so the laws we passed with Republican and Democrat help are challenging that soft bigotry of low expectation. We believe every child can learn. We want to know if every child can read and write and add and subtract early, before it's too late. We're going to stop this business about just shuffling children through the school, year after year, without learning the basics. We'll correct problems now. We're raising the bar. No dejamos a ningun nino atras. No child will be left behind in America.;Recently, I talked about a school in Georgia, northeast Georgia, called Gainesville Elementary School. It's mostly Hispanic, mostly poor. It's the kind of school where people just say, "Well, gosh, these kids can't learn. Give up. Move them through." This year, 90 percent of the students passed the State tests in reading and math. That's a fantastic statistic, isn't it?;We wouldn't know if we didn't measure. We wouldn't know if we didn't ask the questions about whether a child can read and write and add and subtract. We wouldn't know if we didn't correct problems early, before they're too late. And fortunately, the school has got a principal that has challenged the soft bigotry of low expectations. Here's what he said: "We don't focus on what we can't do at this school. We focus on what we can do. We do whatever it takes to get the kids across the finish line.;That's what we're going to do here in this country. As we celebrate this important month, our mission, our goal, our deepest desire is for every child—every child—including those whose parents don't speak English as a first language, to be able to realize the promise of this country by making sure the public schools have high standards in excellence in every classroom. And that's what we're going to do.;As we celebrate this important month, we also need to celebrate ownership, because that's part of the American experience. We want more people owning their own home. I think there's nothing better than people opening up the door where they live and saying, "Welcome to my home." "Bienvenidos a mi casa." [ Laughter ] "Thanks for coming to my piece of property." And we must be dedicated to the proposition that ownership ought to extend to every neighborhood and every group.;I set a goal to have 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of this decade. And we're on track to meet the goal—1.6 million new minority homeowners bought homes in the last 2 years. It's a fantastic statistic, I think. I think it's part of helping bring hope into people's families.;Also I'd like to talk about entrepreneurship. I mean, the Latino community is entrepreneurial. I mean, you talk about small-business owners who have got vision and drive and desire, sit down with Latino businessowners. They have a great sense of business and balance sheet and, as importantly, a great desire to own their own business. And one of the most hopeful aspects of our society today is the number of Hispanic-owned businesses that thrive throughout America. I love it when I meet an Hispanic entrepreneur, particularly somebody who came up with an idea at their kitchen table and said, "I want to own something. I want to own my business." And now they're employing people. Seventy percent of new jobs in America are created by small businesses. Think about that. And the role of Government is to encourage the expansion of small-business opportunity and entrepreneurship through every society, every part of our society. And we're doing just that in America, and our country is better for it.;Listen, we're a diverse nation, but there are things that bind us, our love of freedom, our belief in God, our understanding of the importance of family, our desire to realize dreams, the deep desire for people to live in a free society. I'm proud of your heritage. I'm proud of the ancestry. I'm proud to call Latinos Americans, and I'm proud to be your President.;God bless, and welcome to the White House.</td></tr>

Bush: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for FY05</td><td class="c6">September 15, 2004</td><td class="c7">Presidential Determination No. 2004-47;Memorandum for the Secretary of State;Subject: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for FY05;Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Venezuela, and Vietnam.;The Majors List applies by its terms to "countries." The United States Government interprets the term broadly to include entities that exercise autonomy over actions or omissions that could lead to a decision to place them on the list and, subsequently, to determine their eligibility for certification. A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing country set forth in section 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug-transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma as a country that has failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report is a justification (statement of explanation) for the determination on Burma, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have removed Thailand from the list of major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries. Thailand's opium poppy cultivation is well below the levels specified in the FRAA, no heroin processing laboratories have been found in Thailand for several years, and Thailand is no longer a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances significantly affecting the United States, nor is it a country through which such drugs or substances are transported.;In contrast to the Government of Haiti's dismal performance last year under the Aristide regime, the new Interim Government of Haiti (IGOH), headed by Prime Minister Latortue, has taken substantive - if limited - counternarcotics actions in the few months it has been in office. Nevertheless, we remain deeply concerned about the ability of Haitian law enforcement to reorganize and restructure sufficiently to carry out sustained counternarcotics efforts.;The decreased use of MDMA (Ecstasy) among young people in the United States is a hopeful sign, but we continue to place priority on stopping the threat of club drugs, including MDMA, of which The Netherlands continues to be the dominant source country. The Government of The Netherlands is an enthusiastic and capable partner, and we commend its efforts. We continue to be concerned, however, by obstacles to mutual legal assistance and extradition from The Netherlands. There is a need to work more deliberately to disrupt the criminal organizations responsible for the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs. Specifically, we urge enhanced use of financial investigation, including full exploitation of anti-money laundering statutes and financial investigators to identify and dismantle trafficking organizations, and to seize and forfeit the assets acquired from the drug trade.;While the vast majority of illicit drugs entering the United States continue to come from South America and Mexico, we remain concerned about the substantial flow of illicit drugs from Canada. I commend Canada for its successful efforts to curb the diversion of precursor chemicals used in methamphetamine production. We are now working intensively with Canadian authorities to address the increase in the smuggling of Canadian-produced marijuana into the United States, however we are concerned the lack of significant judicial sanctions against marijuana producers is resulting in greater involvement in the burgeoning marijuana industry by organized criminal groups. Canada has expressed concern to us about the flow of cocaine and other illicit substances through the United States into Canada. United States and Canadian law enforcement personnel have collaborated on a number of investigations that have led to the dismantling of several criminal organizations. The two governments will continue to work closely in the year ahead to confront these shared threats.;Nigeria put measures in place to increase the effectiveness of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, and also arrested a trafficker wanted by the United States, which met the agreed-upon interdiction targets. However, Nigeria must take significant and decisive action to investigate and prosecute political corruption, which continues to undermine the transparency of its government. President Obasanjo took steps to address corruption at the G-8 meetings in Sea Island, Georgia, by entering into a Compact to Promote Transparency and Combat Corruption. Positive transparent measures will in turn benefit Nigeria's anti-narcotics efforts, the rule of law, and all democratic institutions.;Despite good faith efforts on the part of the central Afghanistan government, we are concerned about increased opium crop production in the provinces.;We are deeply concerned about heroin and methamphetamine linked to North Korea being trafficked to East Asian countries. We consider it highly likely that state agents and enterprises in North Korea are involved in the narcotics trade. While we know that some opium poppy is cultivated in North Korea, reliable information confirming the extent of opium production is currently lacking. There are also clear indications that North Koreans traffic in, and probably manufacture, methamphetamine. In recent years, authorities in the region have routinely seized shipments of methamphetamine and/or heroin that had been transferred to traffickers' ships from North Korean vessels. The April 2003 seizure of 125 kilograms of heroin smuggled to Australia aboard the North Korean-owned vessel "Pong Su" is the latest and largest seizure of heroin pointing to North Korean complicity in the drug trade. Although there is no evidence that narcotics originating in or transiting North Korea reach the United States, we are working closely with our partners in the region to stop North Korean involvement in illicit narcotics production and trafficking.;We appreciate the efforts of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and others in the region to stop the diversion of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine used to manufacture methamphetamine. However, considering the growing methamphetamine problem in North America and Asia, additional collaborative efforts to control these precursor chemicals are necessary.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;George W.

Bush: Remarks at the Closing Session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Santiago</td><td class="c6">November 20, 2004</td><td class="c7">Thank you very much. Sientese. Gracias. Thank you for the warm welcome. It is such an honor to be in Chile. Who is ever responsible for the weather, thank you very much. Laura and I are delighted to be here. Chile is such a fabulous country. It's a great place to talk about entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit. It's a country which shows the world what is possible when you create the right conditions for economic vitality and economic growth. And we're so honored to be here.;I want to thank my friend Ricardo Lagos for organizing this summit. I appreciate the business leaders who are here. I thank you for your interest in working collaboratively with business leaders from around the world. And as a result of vision and hard work, we meet today on the eastern rim of an incredibly dynamic region.;In our lifetimes, we've seen the Asia-Pacific region grow in wealth and freedom beyond many—beyond that which many thought was possible. If you think back about 20 years ago, what people thought about the Asian-Pacific region, they couldn't imagine such prosperity and such wealth and such freedom. And that's what APEC is all about, as far as I'm concerned. And that's why it's an honor to be here at this summit with my fellow leaders.;Incredibly enough, APEC economies account for nearly half of all the world trade and half of the world's economic output. For somebody who is interested in prosperity for my own citizens, it's a good place to hang out, with that much trade, commerce. And I believe that this new century, with the right policies, can extend the prosperity even further. And that's what we're here to discuss.;I believe we must increase the flow of trade and capital. I know our societies must reward enterprise and open societies and open markets. I know we've got to reject the blocks and barriers that divide economies and people. And I believe, with the right policies, we can continue to grow.;I'm honored to be here today with a man who has served our country so well, a great United States Secretary of State, Colin Powell. Right after my speech, he's headed to the Middle East. That's a heck of a retirement, Mr. Secretary. [ Laughter ] I look forward to your report when you get back.;I want to thank the U.S. members of the APEC Business Advisory Council. I want to thank you for your hard work. I want to thank you for representing our country so well. I appreciate Gary Benanav and Mike Drucker—Mike Ducker and Robert Prieto for your hard work in organizing this summit and representing the business leaders who are here.;You know, what's interesting about our country is that for years, we were isolated from the world by two great oceans, and for a while we got a false sense of security as a result of that. We thought we were protected forever from trade policy or terrorist attacks because oceans protected us. What's interesting about today's world is that the oceans now connect us. It didn't take all that long in the march of history for that change to take place. And therefore, America must respect and value the friendships that we're able to make as a result of our transatlantic and transpacific ties. Right after I'm inaugurated, I'll go to Europe to renew our transatlantic ties, to remind the people of Europe how important my administration regards our vital Atlantic alliance.;And of course, our Nation is Pacific country as well. And that's why the APEC * conferences are so important. Do you realize, the capital of our 50th State is nearly as close to Sydney and Manila as it is to Washington, DC? That's a Pacific Rim nation. More than 15 percent of Americans claim Hispanic or Asian-Pacific heritage. Our APEC partners account for nearly two-thirds of all American exports and imports. America's future is inseparable from our friends in the Pacific. And by working together and by continuing to foster reasonable progrowth economic policies, the fellowship of Pacific nations will continue to be strong. That's what I'm here to tell you.;There is a different attitude in the world about foreign policies, particularly if you happen to be an influential nation. In the past, many powerful nations preferred others to remain underdeveloped and therefore dependent. It was a cynical doctrine. And that doctrine is unsuited for our times. In this century, countries benefit from healthy, prosperous, confident partners. Weak and troubled nations export their ills—problems like economic instability and illegal immigration and crime and terrorism. America and others sitting around the table here at APEC understand that healthy and prosperous nations export and import goods and services that help to stabilize regions and add security to every nation. So we've got three clear goals to help spread prosperity and hope and to secure the peace.;We want to seek wider trade and broader freedom and greater security for the benefit of our partners and for the benefit of all. That's what I'm going to do over the next 4 years. The first goal is to lower barriers to trade and investment and to promote sound fiscal policies for all our governments. Free and fair trade combined with prudent fiscal discipline are the foundation of the region's remarkable prosperity, and I'm committed to staying on the path to progrowth—proeconomic growth—economic growth by progrowth policies. We're doing our part.;You know, we've overcome a lot in the U.S. economy. We faced a recession, coupled with terrorist attacks, which affected our capacity to grow. But we stimulated our economy by cutting taxes. And America is growing again, and people are working. And the question ahead is, how do we make sure we maintain growth?;We need legal reform in the United States. We got to make sure that those who risk capital are rewarded for taking risk and not subject to needless and frivolous lawsuits. We need regulatory reform in the United States. Our Tax Code is too complex. So I'm going to work with members of both political parties to simplify the Tax Code.;But I also understand there is concern about whether or not our Government is dedicated to dealing with our deficits, both short term and long term. I look forward to standing up in front of the Congress in my State of the Union and telling them why I submitted a budget that will help us deal with the short-term deficit of the United States, and I will do that. And I'll also work with Members of Congress to deal with the unfunded liabilities of our entitlement systems, so that we can say clearly to the world, the United States of America is committed to deficit reduction, both short term and long term.;Overall, the economy of this part of the world is expected to grow by nearly 5 percent this year. And that's good news, and the United States wanted to be a part of that growth. We can add to that progress by reducing trade barriers that I believe are an obstacle to economic growth everywhere, especially in the developing world. And so this Government and our country is strongly committed to the WTO's Doha round of negotiations. And my trade minister will be strongly committed to ensure the success of the WTO round. And we need your help in making sure that nations around the APEC table are focused on the benefits of global trade, that we put aside some differences that could prevent Doha from going forward.;We will continue to assist our Asia-Pacific partners in meeting their WTO obligations. We are encouraging Russia and Vietnam in their efforts to join the WTO. The history between our countries has changed dramatically between America and Vietnam and Russia. The tensions are no longer existing. Conflict is behind us, and we have a chance to work with those countries for the common good, and we will.;We're going to be aggressive about our bilateral trade agreements and our regional trade agreements. We've completed trade agreements with nations throughout Asia and the Americas, including Australia, Singapore, Chile, the five nations of Central America, and the Dominican Republic. We are working on new agreements with Thailand, Panama, the Andean nations of South America. We're moving ahead with the enterprise for the ASEAN initiative, which is lowering trade barriers and strengthening economic ties in Southeast Asia. We're committed to the Bogor goals, which call for free trade among developed nations of the Asian-Pacific region by 2010 and free trade among all APEC economies by 2020. We seek free trade in the Americas, uniting the markets of all 34 free nations in the Western Hemisphere.;I think you can tell that I believe free trade is necessary for economic development, that free trade is essential to prosperity. But it is not sufficient, and we understand that. All governments in the region must make the difficult choices needed to stabilize economies and to keep public finances on foot. We have been impressed by the reform programs in Chile and Colombia and Uruguay that have spurred growth and investment in those countries and throughout the region.;My Nation and many others have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies and holds millions of people in poverty, and we will continue to do so. We will continue working to relieve the current debt of those highly indebted poor countries that pursue sound fiscal policy. We will continue to encourage our large trading partners to adopt flexible market-based exchange rates for their currencies. Expanding prosperity has lifted millions in our region out of poverty, has bound our nations closer together, and has benefited all our people. And my administration will continue to promote pro-growth, pro-trade economic policies for the good of all.;Our second goal is to spread the benefits of freedom and democracy and good government across parts of the world. We've seen progress toward these goals in the recent history of the Asia-Pacific region. We've seen some interesting lessons of history as free markets take hold: The demand for limited government and self-rule builds. That's why it's important to promote free trade and open market policies.;In the long run, economic freedom and political liberty are indivisible, and the advance of freedom is good for all, as free societies are peaceful societies. My Government and many others are working with countries to lay the foundations for democracy by helping them institute the rule of law and independent courts and a free press and political parties and trade unions. We have joined with other members of the Organization of American States to create the Inter-American Democratic Charter. This charter recognizes democracy as a fundamental right of all peoples in the Americas and pledges our governments to promoting and defending the institutions and habits of liberty.;Because political liberty and economic freedom go hand in hand, America and many nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002, we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. We created the Millennium Challenge Account in America that says we'll increase aid and help to nations which are willing to fight corruption, which are willing to educate their people, which are willing to spend money on the health of their citizens, and nations which are willing to expand economic freedom. We owe that to the taxpayers of the United States, to promote the habits necessary for free societies to develop. And we believe every nation is capable of fighting corruption, is capable of putting good economic policies in place, is capable of educating their people and helping defeat the scourge of bad health care.;Developing nations have responded, and we appreciate that, but not nearly as much as the people who live in their countries. They've responded by fighting corruption, by building schools and hospitals, and passing new laws that reward enterprise from their people.;The United Nations also has an important role, and America has proposed a democracy fund to help countries lay the foundations of democracy and help set up voter precincts and polling places and support the work of election monitors.;The growth of free and hopeful societies depends on controlling the spread of deadly diseases, especially AIDS and tuberculosis and malaria. HIV/AIDS cases are growing in the Asian-Pacific region. It's an issue we just discussed with the leaders around the table. Last year more than 1 million new HIV infections occurred in Asia, one out of every five infections worldwide. My Nation is working to fight this disease through a $15 billion Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief—15 billion over 5 years, which helps—provides help for 100 nations around the world. Earlier this year, we expanded the focus of this effort by committing new resources to Asia.;As part of this effort, the United States is supporting the United Nations Global Fund, and other nations need to participate in that fund. It's not the United States global fund, it is the world global fund. And so I'm going to continue to urge nations here at this APEC Summit to contribute to that fund, to help defeat this pandemic that has swept across the continent of Africa and now threatens nations in Asia. It is the greatest—AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and all nations must join in a united effort to turn the tide against this terrible disease.;The spread of liberty is our most powerful weapon in the fight against hatred and terror. And we've seen some amazing events take place in the history of liberty. Perhaps the most amazing of all took place in Afghanistan when millions of people showed up to vote for the President of that country some 3 years after that country had been ruled by the barbarians called the Taliban. And the most amazing moment of all in this march of democracy was the fact that the first voter was a 19-year-old woman. Freedom has taken place in parts of the world where people never dreamt freedom is possible, and as a result, the world is better for it.;Our third great goal is to help keep up the fight against the forces of terror that threaten the success of our economies and the stability of the world. Every nation represented here has a stake in this conflict. Terrorism is a threat not just to the West or to the wealthy but to all of us. And all of us must do everything we can to defeat the murderers.;We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror. And my Nation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined to prevent the proliferation of deadly weapons and materials and to enforce the just demands of the world. And my Nation is grateful to the soldiers of those nations who've helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlaw dictator. We're determined to destroy terrorist networks wherever they operate, and the United States is grateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets and to track down their operatives and to disrupt their plans.;APEC nations are playing a crucial role in the war on terror, for which we are very grateful. We'll continue to work with nations that have the will to fight terror but need help in developing the means. We're sharing intelligence and increasing our cooperation in customs and law enforcement to stop terrorists before they can strike. We're moving forward on the initiatives of last year's summit in Bangkok to strengthen the security of our ports and transportation networks, to defend our aircraft from the threat of portable missiles, and to end the flow of terrorist finances.;America has joined with Singapore to found a new research institute, which opened this year, dedicated to stopping the spread of deadly diseases and combating the threat of bioterrorism. We're working to ensure that the shores of the Pacific remain peaceful. In Santiago, APEC leaders committed to signing by 2005 the additional protocol of the IAEA safeguards agreements, which requires nations to declare a broad range of nuclear activities and facilities and allows the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect those facilities. And I appreciate that cooperation and that commitment.;We also agreed to further strengthen our Nation's export controls and to develop a new system to track and stop the travel of suspected terrorists using forged or stolen documents. Through the Proliferation Security Initiative, many nations are also fighting the trade in deadly weapons. And over the past years we've had notable successes, most particularly the disruption of the A.Q. Khan network and its willingness and capacity to spread deadly technology to nations that would like to inflict harm on the—to inflict harm on nations like APEC members.;Five APEC members are working to convince North Korea to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, and I can report to you today, having visited with the other nations involved in that collaborative effort, that the will is strong, that the effort is united, and the message is clear to Mr. Kim Chong-il: Get rid of your nuclear weapons programs.;In all our efforts, we'll maintain and strengthen the alliance among our nations that have served the peace so well. By making our countries safer, these steps will also create a more secure business environment and boost confidence in our economies. You know as well as I know that terrorist attacks affect the capacity of people to make a living. We discovered that firsthand in the United States of America when we lost nearly a million jobs in the 3 months after the September the 11th attacks. The people of Bali, Indonesia, know what I'm talking about when it comes to terrorist attacks. We have an obligation as nations to work together to stop terrorism.;And you in the private sector have an important role to play. The new inspection technologies that you create can shorten delays and reduce insurance costs and cut redtape. By working closely with customs officials of APEC governments to establish better procedures, you can make the delivery of goods and services more secure and more efficient.;These are great goals that I've just talked about: goals to advance our common prosperity, goals to spread freedom and dignity, and goals to strengthen our common security. And I have come here to Chile to tell my colleagues and friends, the United States of America is committed to achieving those goals for the next 4 years.;Thank you for your interest. Thank you for coming.</td></tr>

This weekend I am on my first trip outside the United States since the election, traveling to South America for the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. I am meeting with many allies and friends to strengthen our ties across the Pacific and discuss practical ways we can enhance prosperity, advance liberty, and improve our shared security.;America and the nations of Latin America and Asia share many vital interests. All Pacific nations benefit from free and fair trade, the foundation of this region's remarkable prosperity. The United States has completed free trade agreements with nations throughout Asia and the Americas, including Australia and Singapore, Chile, the five nations in Central America, and the Dominican Republic. We are also negotiating new agreements with Thailand, Panama, and the Andean nations of South America. America has opened our markets, and I will urge other countries to do the same.;Pacific nations also have a clear interest in spreading the benefits of liberty, democracy, and good government across this vital part of the world. From the recent history of the Asia-Pacific region, we know that freedom is indivisible. The economic liberty that builds prosperity also builds a demand for limited government and self rule. Modernization and progress eventually require freedom in all its forms. And the advance of freedom is good for all, because free societies are peaceful societies.;America and our friends are helping other countries lay the foundations of democracy by establishing independent courts, a free press, political parties, and trade unions, by instituting the rule of law, and by keeping up the fight against corruption.;America joined with other members of the Organization of American States to create the Inter-American Democratic Charter.

This year, APEC leaders will work together to improve the security of our ships and ports. We will develop a new system to track and stop the travel of suspected terrorists using forged or stolen documents. And we launched new programs to support APEC members that have the will to fight terror but need help in developing the means. Terrorism is a threat, not just to the West or to the wealthy but to every nation. And every nation must fight the murderers.;During my trip, I will also meet with President Lagos of Chile and President Uribe of Colombia to reaffirm our strong ties with those nations. Colombia is making progress in the fight against terrorists who traffic in illegal drugs, and America is standing with the Colombian Government to oppose the drug trade that destroys lives in our countries and threatens the stability of our hemisphere.;In my second term, I will continue to pursue a confident foreign policy agenda that will spread freedom and hope and make our Nation more secure. America seeks wider trade and broader freedom and greater security for the benefit of America, our partners, and all of the world.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

[ Laughter ] So, like, what took you so long? [ Laughter ] Welcome. And welcome to the citizens of the Red Sox Nation. I'm proud to be joined by the Vice President. He's a Chicago Cubs fan. So, like, he knows what you've been through. [ Laughter ] We're really glad you're here.;There's been a lot of people in this town waiting for this day to come. Some have said it would be a cold day when the Red Sox made it here. [ Laughter ] I am honored to welcome the world champs, the mighty Boston Red Sox, to the White House.;I want to welcome the members of the Massachusetts delegation who are here. I know that Senator Kennedy is here. Senator Kerry is on his way. We have just finished a ceremony honoring Jackie Robinson. I know members of the congressional delegation are here from like Massachusetts, and everybody else that claims to be a Red Sox State. [ Laughter ] You all are welcome here.;I appreciate the commissioner coming. And Bob, it's good to see you. I thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate the mayor being here, the mayor of Boston. You've had a heck of a year, Mayor. [ Laughter ] I want to thank and welcome my friend Tom Werner and Larry Lucchino. I'm sorry John Henry is sick. You know, Lucchino, I knew you'd amount to something eventually. [ Laughter ];I appreciate the way this team played baseball. You know, it took a lot of guts, and it took a lot of hair. [ Laughter ] It took a great manager and coaching staff, and I'll never forget calling Terry Francona after the team won the championship, and he—the only thing I remember him saying was, "It's all—it all depended upon the players," which is why he's a good manager, isn't it?;I appreciate the fact that Dom DiMaggio and Jimmy Piersall are with us. You guys represent a lot of great Boston Red Sox players that a lot of us grew up watching play, and you're welcome here in the White House, and you're representing a great tradition of wonderful folks.;You know, the last time the Red Sox were here, Woodrow Wilson lived here. [ Laughter ] There were only 16 teams in baseball then. After the World Series victory in 1918, a reporter from Boston said, "The luckiest baseball spot on Earth is Boston, for it has never lost a World Series." [ Laughter ] That's one optimistic writer. [ Laughter ];Senator, welcome. Good to see you. Only time I—I like to see Senator Kerry, except when we're fixing to debate—[ laughter ]— if you know what I mean. [ Laughter ];No one really expected the answer to the "Curse of the Bambino" would come from a group of players that call themselves "idiots," except for maybe idiots who don't understand baseball. This is a heck of a team. This is a team that came together from South Korea and Dominican Republic, from Anchorage, Alaska, Fort Riley, Kansas, and incredibly enough, Midland, Texas. [ Applause ] Oh, yes. Finally, somebody from Midland amounted to something. [ Laughter ];I love the way this team played, and so do baseball fans. I mean, this is a team that won eight games in a row when it wasn't supposed to. It's kind of courage and a couple of stitches. You answered 86 years of prayer. That's an amazing feat, isn't it? I mean, when the Red Sox won, people all over the world cheered. They cheered in New England, and they cheered in Baghdad, Iraq. One guy said—from Boston—he said, "Now we just have to wait for the other six signs of the apocalypse." [ Laughter ];I really appreciate what Boston does off the field too. The Jimmy Fund is a classic example of a sports franchise giving something back to the community in which they play. You created the Red Sox Scholars, which awards scholarships to disadvantaged fifth graders. I appreciate what individual players do. I know firsthand what the Schillings do, the SHADE Foundation to work to prevent skin cancer and the—and Shonda and Curt's leadership in the battle against Lou Gehrig's disease. I appreciate what the Red Sox are doing in the Dominican Republic with "Senor Octubre.;But most of all, our purpose here is to welcome champs. We wish you all the best in the upcoming season. We know that you've been able to do what has been viewed to be the impossible. And just like that sportswriter said in 1918, you know, Boston is the place to cover champs.;Welcome to the White House. May God continue to bless you all.</td></tr>

Bush: Proclamation 7882 - Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2005</td><td class="c6">April 5, 2005</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;Leaders across the Americas understand that the hope for peace in our world depends on the unity of free nations. Each year, the people of the United States observe Pan American Day and Pan American Week to honor our shared commitment to freedom, prosperity, and security. We are working with our partners in the Western Hemisphere to advance our common interests and values so that we can build a brighter future for our citizens.;The idea of regional solidarity and inter-American cooperation, first envisioned in 1826 by Simon Bolivar, became a reality in 1890 when the First International Conference of American States concluded its meetings in Washington, D.C. There, President Benjamin Harrison praised the efforts of the countries in attendance for their desire to work together as American States. Through the years, these efforts, shared values, and mutual respect have strengthened this partnership.;Across our hemisphere, social, economic, military, and political cooperation are widespread. Last year, trade officials of five Central American nations and the Dominican Republic signed the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement with the United States. I urge the Congress to ratify this agreement, which will eliminate tariffs and trade barriers and expand regional opportunities.;My Administration remains committed to the Inter-American Democratic Charter to advance democracy and defend freedom across our region. Our Nation's continued support of democratic institutions, constitutional processes, and basic liberties gives hope and strength to those struggling in our hemisphere and around the world to preserve the rule of law and their God-given rights.;The democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere believe in the rights and dignity of every person, and we believe that liberty is worth defending. In the spirit of Pan American cooperation, we will continue to work to strengthen ties among our nations and further democracy, peace, and prosperity.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2005, as Pan American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2005, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-ninth.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Remarks Following a Meeting With Central American Leaders</td><td class="c6">May 12, 2005</td><td class="c7">Good morning. Thank you for coming. Welcome to the White House, and welcome to the Rose Garden.;I want to thank the six Presidents who have joined me today. We've just had a constructive dialog in the Cabinet Room about our mutual interests. Our mutual interests are prosperity for our people and peace in the region. I am honored to be here with six really fine leaders, people who have stood strong for democracy and who care deeply about the people of their nations.;We're here today, as well, because the best way to achieve peace and prosperity for our hemisphere is by strengthening democracy and continuing the economic transformation of Central America and the Dominican Republic. All of us agree that the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement presents us with an historic opportunity to advance our common goals in an important part of our neighborhood.;CAFTA brings benefits to all sides. For the newly emerging democracies of Central America, CAFTA would bring new investment that means good jobs and higher labor standards for their workers. Central American consumers would have better access to more U.S. goods at better prices. And by passing this agreement, we would signal that the world's leading trading nation was committed to closer partnership with countries in our own backyard, countries which share our values.;For American farmers, businesses, and workers, CAFTA would create a more level playing field. Under existing rules, most of Central America's exports already enter the United States duty free. But our products still face hefty tariffs there. By passing CAFTA, we would open up a market of 44 million consumers who already import more of our goods and services than Australia or Brazil. And we would create incentives for factories to stay in Central America and use American materials rather than relocate to Asia, where they are more likely to use Asian materials.;Finally, for the Western Hemisphere, CAFTA would bring the stability and security that can only come from freedom. Today, a part of the world that was once characterized by oppression and military dictatorship now sees its future in free elections and free trade, and we must not take these gains for granted. These are small nations, but they're making big and brave commitments, and America needs to continue to support them as they walk down the road of openness and accountability. By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful free trade area, we will promote democratic governance, human rights, and economic liberty for everyone.;The United States was built on freedom, and the more of it we have in our own backyard, the freer and safer and more prosperous all of the Americas will be. I applaud these leaders for their vision. I thank them for working with Members of Congress from both political parties to persuade those Members about the importance of this piece of legislation. I assured them I will join in the efforts to get this bill passed. This bill is good for Central American countries, it is good for America.;I want to thank you all for being here.

I'm pleased to congratulate a distinguished public servant, Rob Portman, on becoming our new United States Trade Representative.;It's an honor to be with Rob's dad as well as Jane and Jed and Will and Sally. Glad you all are here. It's always great when our Trade Representative has teenagers in the house. [ Laughter ] It helps him become a skilled negotiator. [ Laughter ] I appreciate the other members of the Portman family who have joined us.;I thank members of my Cabinet who are here. Josh Bolten, thank you for coming. I appreciate Peter Allgeier, who is the Deputy U.S. Trade Minister. Peter, good to see you, sir.;I want to thank the Members of Congress who came, David Camp from Michigan, Paul Ryan from Wisconsin—and Janna. I appreciate—I'm not through yet— [ laughter ]——;Audience member. I'm sorry, sir. [ Laughter ];The President. ——and Melissa Hart. Rick Lazio, former Member, thank you for coming.;I want to thank the Ambassadors who are here, diplomatic corps, Embajadores de Central America, as well as other ambassadors—welcome.;Ambassador Portman will be carrying on the superb work done by Bob Zoellick.;Under Ambassador Zoellick's outstanding leadership, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has worked with Congress to pass trade promotion authority. We've completed free trade agreements with 12 nations on 5 continents. And those agreements will open a combined market of 124 million consumers for America's farmers, small businesses, and manufacturers. I want to thank all the men and women at the USTR for the good work they have done.;Ambassador Portman is the right man to carry on this important work. He has a great record as a champion of free and fair trade. In his early days as an attorney, he specialized in international trade law. Throughout his time in Congress, he built a reputation as a steadfast proponent of the power of open markets to spread hope and prosperity around the world. As an Ohioan, Rob knows how much American farmers and workers depend on our export markets and how the expansion of agreements around the world can contribute to our economy here at home.;To advance our trade agenda, we have three priorities in the months ahead. Our first trade priority is to pass the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA. That is an important priority of this administration, and it should be an important priority of the United States Congress. Last week, I met with the six Presidents from the nations. We all share an interest in prosperity for our people and peace in the region, and CAFTA gives us an historic opportunity to advance these common goals.;The agreement does four key things: It will level the playing field for American farmers and businesses, it will help our economy, it will make the region more competitive with Asia, and it will strengthen democracy in our backyard. At the moment, about 80 percent of imports from the region already enter the United States duty-free. Our market is open to the goods from CAFTA nations. CAFTA will open the region's markets of 44 million consumers to our goods and our services and our crops. CAFTA will also lower barriers in key segments like textiles. This would put CAFTA countries and America in a better position to compete with low-cost producers in Asia.;As it opens the Western Hemisphere markets, CAFTA will also bring the stability and security that can only come from freedom. Today, a part of the world that was once characterized by unrest and dictatorship now sees its future in free elections and free trade, and we must not take these gains for granted. These are small nations, but they are making big and brave commitments, and America needs to continue to support them as they walk down the road of openness and accountability. By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful free trade area, we will promote democratic governance and human rights and the economic liberty for everyone. CAFTA is a really important piece of legislation.;Our second trade priority is to encourage the Doha Development Agenda now being pursued by the World Trade Organization. This new framework is the largest negotiation of its kind in history, and it would reduce and eliminate tariffs in key industry sectors and unfair agricultural subsidies and open the global market in services.;Finally, our third trade priority is to ensure that those who sign trade agreements live up to their terms. China's membership in the World Trade Organization has been a good thing for America. Our exports to China have increased 81 percent since China's entry into the WTO. When it joined the WTO, China also agreed to the rules of international trade, and it's in the interest of both China and the United States for China to abide by them.;One reason I selected Ambassador Portman for this job is because I know he'll work to see that our farmers and our workers and service providers are treated fairly. Ambassador Portman will work to ensure that China stops the piracy of U.S. intellectual property, lifts the barriers that are keeping our goods and services out of China, and demonstrates its commitment to transparency and distribution rights for our products.;America is a nation founded on the idea of open exchange, and free and fair trade is a win-win for all sides. By opening new markets, we'll increase prosperity for our small businesses and farmers and manufacturers and create jobs for American workers. By enforcing trade laws and agreements, we will ensure a level playing field for America's workers. American workers can compete with anybody, anytime, anywhere when the rules are fair.;Rob Portman is America's Trade Representative. He's also my friend. I know his integrity and his wisdom and his dedication. And I know he's the right man to carry out our bold agenda at this important moment for world trade.;I want to thank you all again for coming. Congratulations, Rob.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="c2"><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=73921&st=dominican&st1=" target="blank">http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=73921&st=dominican&st1=</a></td><td class="c5">George W. Bush: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">May 31, 2005</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you. Please be seated. I hope you enjoyed your Memorial Day weekend.;My message to Congress when they come back is this, that our economy is strong, but we need to work together to make sure that we continue to have a prosperous economy, so people can find jobs. I say it's strong because we've added over 3.5 million new jobs over the last 2 years, and the unemployment rate is 5.2 percent. More Americans are working today than ever before. Homeownership is at an all-time high. Small businesses are flourishing. Families are taking home more of what they earn.;Obviously, these are hopeful signs. But Congress can make sure that the signs remain hopeful, and here are four good things they need to do.;First, they need to finish the work on an energy bill. We've gone more than a decade without an energy strategy. And as a result, we have grown more dependent on foreign sources of energy, and consumers see the consequences of that at the gas pump on a daily basis.;For the past 4 years, I've called on Congress to pass legislation that encourages energy conservation, that promotes domestic production in environmentally friendly ways, that helps diversify away from foreign oil, that modernizes the electricity grid, that's got a substantial amount of research and development money to help us transition from the hydrocarbon economy to a diversified source of energy economy.;The House passed a bill, and the Senate Energy Committee passed an energy bill this past week. I appreciate their good work. Now they need to get the bill off the floor, into conference, resolve their differences, and get me a bill before the August recess. That's what the American people expect, and that's what I expect.;Second, Congress needs to be wise about the taxpayers' dollars. I proposed a disciplined Federal budget that holds discretionary spending growth below the rate of inflation and reduces discretionary spending for nonsecurity programs. The House and the Senate have worked together to pass a responsible budget resolution that meets our priorities and keeps us on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. The weeks ahead will bring important decisions on spending bills, and the weeks ahead will bring in efforts to rein in mandatory spending. We look forward to working with Congress to do just that. Congress must keep its commitment to spending restraint if we want this economy to continue to grow.;Third, Congress needs to ratify the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, that's called CAFTA. This agreement is a good deal for American workers and farmers and small businesses. See, about 80 percent of the products from Central America and the Dominican Republic now enter the United States duty-free, yet our exports to Central America and the Dominican Republic face hefty tariffs. CAFTA will level the playing field by making about 80 percent of American exports to those countries duty-free. I've always said I'm for free and fair trade. This makes our trade with the CAFTA countries fair, and that's important. After all, the CAFTA agreement will open a market of 44 million consumers to our producers, to our workers, the products that our workers make, to our farmers.;We'll lower barriers in key sectors like textiles, which will make American manufacturers more profitable and competitive in the global market. It will keep jobs here in America. And it will support young democracies. And that's going to be important. There's a geopolitical as well as economic concern for CAFTA. And Congress needs to pass this piece of legislation.;And finally, Congress needs to move forward with Social Security reform. I'm going to continue traveling our country talking about Social Security reform. I'll remind our seniors who are getting a check today that nothing will change, and yet I'm going to continue to remind the people that we've got a serious problem for younger workers. Part of Social Security reform, Congress should ensure that future generations receive benefits equal to or greater than the benefits today's seniors get. And Congress should help those who rely most on Social Security by increasing benefits faster for low-income workers than those workers who are better off.;And as we permanently solve the Social Security problem, we need to make Social Security a better deal for younger workers by allowing them to take some of their own money and invest it in a voluntary personal savings account. A voluntary personal savings account is very similar to the personal savings account Members of Congress can do. See, my attitude is, if a personal savings account—a voluntary personal savings account is good enough for a Member of the United States Congress or a Member of the United States Senate—in other words, they felt that was a good enough deal for them so they could get a better rate of return—it surely seems like it's good enough for workers across the country.;And so I look forward to working with the United States Congress on these priorities to help strengthen the long-term economic security of the country. The American people expect people of both parties to work together. They look forward to the Congress setting aside partisan differences and getting something done. And so do I. I'm looking forward to that. So I look forward to welcome the Congress back and working together with them.;And now, I'll be glad to take some of your questions. Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press], why don't you start.;Situation in Iraq;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, since Iraq's new Government was announced on April 28th, more than 60 Americans and 760 Iraqis have been killed in attacks. Do you think that the insurgency is gaining strength and becoming more lethal? And do you think that Iraq's Government is up to the job of defeating the insurgents and guaranteeing security?;The President. I think the Iraq Government will be up to the task of defeating the insurgents. I think they dealt the insurgents—I think the Iraqi people dealt the insurgents a serious blow when they—when we had the elections. In other words, what the insurgents fear is democracy, because democracy is the opposite of their vision. Their vision is one where a few make the decision for many, and if you don't toe the line, there's serious consequences.;The American people have just got to think about the Taliban if you're interested in thinking—understanding how the insurgents think. They have a—they support an ideology that is the opposite of freedom, in my judgment, and they're willing to use the tools necessary—the terror tools necessary to impose their ideology. And so what you're seeing is a group of frustrated and desperate people who kill innocent life. And obviously, we mourn the loss of every life. But I believe the Iraqi Government is going to be plenty capable of dealing with them, and our job is to help train them so that they can.;I was heartened to see the Iraqi Government announce 40,000 Iraqi troops are well-trained enough to help secure Baghdad. That was a very positive sign. It's a sign that they, the Iraqi leaders, understand they are responsible for their security, ultimately, and that our job is to help them take on that responsibility.;So I'm pleased with the progress. I am pleased that in less than a year's time, there's a democratically elected Government in Iraq, there are thousands of Iraqi soldiers trained and better equipped to fight for their own country, that our strategy is very clear in that we will work to get them ready to fight, and when they're ready, we'll come home. And I hope that's sooner rather than later. But nevertheless, it's very important that we complete this mission, because a free Iraq is in our Nation's long-term interests. A democracy in the heart of the Middle East is an essential part of securing our country and promoting peace for the long run. And it is very important for our country to understand that. A free Iraq will set such a powerful example in a neighborhood that is desperate for freedom. And therefore, we will complete the mission and support this elected Government.;Of course, they've got other tasks. They've got to write a constitution and then have that constitution ratified by the Iraqi people, and then there will be another election. And we, of course, will help them as will many countries around the world.;Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].;YUKOS Oil Co., Case in Russia;Q. The former head of Russia's oil company, Yukos, was sentenced to 9 years in a prison camp today. Do you think the Kremlin went after him because he was a political threat? Are there any repercussions to U.S.-Russian relations as a result of this case?;The President. I expressed my concerns about the case to President Putin because, as I explained to him, here you're innocent until proven guilty, and it appeared to us, or at least people in my administration, that it looked like he had been judged guilty prior to having a fair trial. In other words, he was put in prison and then was tried. I think what will be interesting—and so we've expressed our concerns about the system.;What will be interesting to see is whether or not he appeals. There's a—I think we think he is going to appeal—and then how the appeal will be handled. And so we're watching the ongoing case.;David [David Gregory, NBC News].;Iranian and North Korean Weapons of Mass Destruction;Q. Mr. President, thank you. I wonder if you can explain the administration's decision to allow Iran, in its negotiations with the Europeans, to get WTO status, ascension into the WTO, whether you think that deal, in a sense, has legs. And also, you talked about Iraq being a powerful symbol in that part of the world. One of the things you said going into the war was that it would deter other countries, rogue nations, from developing weapons of mass destruction. And when you think about North Korea and Iran, the opposite is true. They haven't been deterred at all. Why do you think that is?;The President. The first part of your question was about our agreement that Iran should apply for WTO. In other words, we said, "Fine. If you want to apply for WTO, go ahead and apply." That's—and we did that to facilitate the EU-3 discussions with Iran.;I've always believed that the—obviously, the best way to solve any difficult issue is through diplomacy. And in this case, France, Great Britain, and Germany are handling the negotiations on behalf of the rest of the world, which is—those nations which are deeply concerned about Iran having a nuclear weapon.;Now, our policy is very clear on that, and that is that the Iranians violated the NPT agreement. We found out they violated the agreement, and therefore, they're not to be trusted when it comes to highly enriched uranium—or highly enriching uranium. And therefore, our policy is to prevent them from having the capacity to develop enriched uranium to the point where they're able to make a nuclear weapon.;Secondly—and so therefore, we're working with the EU-3 to hopefully convince the Iranians to abandon their pursuits of such a program. And it appears we're making some progress.;So our decision was to allow them to join the WTO—or to apply to join the WTO, which is not ascension to the WTO, it's the right to make an application— seemed like a reasonable decision to make in order to advance the negotiations with our European partners.;Secondly, in terms of North Korea, North Korea had a weapons program that they had concealed, as you might recall, prior to 2002. As a matter of fact, it was prior to 2000—it was a bilateral—so-called bilateral agreement between North Korea and the United States. And it turns out that they had violated that agreement because they were enriching uranium, contrary to the agreement. And we caught them on that. And therefore, I decided to change the policy to encourage other nations to be involved with convincing North Korea to abandon its weapons program. And that's where we are.;And it's important to have China at the table, for example, saying the same thing that the United States is saying, and that is, is that if you want to be a responsible nation, get rid of your weapons programs. It's important to have Japan and South Korea and Russia saying the same thing.;We've got a lot of work to do with the North Korean because he tends to ignore what the other five nations are saying at times. But that doesn't mean we're going to stop, and can continue to press forward to making it clear that if he expects to be treated as a responsible nation, that he needs to listen to the five nations involved.;Thank you.;Q. Would you acknowledge that the war did not deter Iran and North Korea from continuing to pursue their program?;The President. North Korea had its weapons program before, as you know, as did Iran. And as I also told you, David, that we want diplomacy to work, and it's—we want diplomacy to be given a chance to work. And that's exactly the position of the Government. Hopefully it will work. I think it will.;Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News].;Tax Cuts;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. A few moments ago, you mentioned four economic priorities that Congress has to address to keep the economy, in your words, going on the right track and getting stronger. I noticed you didn't mention making permanent the tax cuts that had been passed during your first term. Was that an oversight, or do you think that sacrificing some of those tax cuts might ultimately be necessary to help balance the budget deficit?;The President. Actually, in my budget, as you know, the budget I submitted, we— was one that encouraged permanency. I believe it's essential that we have the tax cuts be permanent. It was implicit in my statement. I haven't changed. Appreciate your clarification. Congress needs to make the tax cuts permanent.;Thalia [Thalia Assuras, CBS News]. And then we go to Terry [Terry Moran, ABC News].;Social Security Reform;Q. Mr. President, you talked on your reelection about having political capital. You have a Republican Congress. How, then, do you explain not being able to push through more of your agenda, especially when it comes to Social Security reform, which the public does not seem to be accepting and your own party is split on?;The President. Well, first of all, I think the public does accept the fact that Social Security is a problem. You might remember a couple of months ago around this town people were saying, "It's not a problem. What's he bringing it up for? Nobody sees it as a problem except for him." And then all of a sudden, people began to look at the facts and realize that in 2017, Social Security—the pay-as-you-go system will be in the red, and in 2042, it's going to be bankrupt. And people then took a good, hard look at the numbers and realized that Social Security is a problem.;And that's the first step toward getting Congress to do something. See, once they hear from the people, we got a problem, the next question the people are going to ask, "What do you intend to do about it?;My second goal has been to convince and assure seniors that nobody's going to take away their checks. As a veteran of American politics, I have withstood the onslaught that said, "When George W. talks about reforming Social Security, that means he's going to take away your check." Over the last 4 years, seniors didn't have their checks taken away, so, hopefully, they're beginning to realize that some of these— some of this politics is ringing hollow. But it's very important for seniors to understand that when we talk about Social Security reform, that they're going to get their check, because there's a lot of people relying upon their Social Security checks.;Thirdly—and so we're just making progress, and this is just the beginning of a very difficult debate. I recognize some in Congress wished I hadn't have brought the issue up. I mean, the easy path is to say, "Oh, we don't have a problem. Let's ignore it yet again." But I view my role as the President as somebody who puts problems on the table and then calls people together to solve them.;This is an issue that really hasn't spent— had that much time in the Halls of Congress—the debate—hasn't been debated in the Halls of Congress since 1983. And so I'm not surprised that there's a reluctance, and I'm not surprised that there's been some initial push-back. But all that does is make me want to continue to travel and remind people that Congress has a duty to come up with some solutions.;They're beginning to have hearings in the Congress. The Ways and Means and the Finance Committee in the Senate are going to have hearings. There's some interesting ideas that have been proposed. We've proposed some interesting ideas. One idea is to make sure that low seniors—low-income seniors get benefits such that when they retire, they're not in poverty. We proposed a plan that takes the—solving the issue about solvency farther down the road than any other President has proposed. In other words, we're putting ideas out.;And so I look forward to working with Congress. There is a duty to respond. There's a duty for people to bring forth their ideas. Now that people understand there's a problem, people who have been elected say, "Okay, here's what I intend to do about it." And we're doing our duty, and I expect people from both parties to do it as well.;Listen, I readily concede there is this attitude in Washington where we can't work together because one party may benefit and the other party may not benefit. The people don't like that. They don't like that attitude. They expect members of both parties to come together to solve problems. And Social Security is a serious problem that requires bipartisan cooperation to solve the problem.;Terry.;Q. Mr. President——;The President. Terry.;Allegations of Prisoner Abuse;Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President, recently, Amnesty International said you have established "a new gulag" of prisons around the world, beyond the reach of the law and decency. I'd like your reaction to that and also your assessment of how it came to this, that that is a view not just held by extremists and anti-Americans but by groups that have allied themselves with the United States Government in the past, and what the strategic impact is that in many places of the world, the United States these days, under your leadership, is no longer seen as the good guy.;The President. I'm aware of the Amnesty International report, and it's absurd. It's an absurd allegation. The United States is a country that is—promotes freedom around the world. When there's accusations made about certain actions by our people, they're fully investigated in a transparent way. It's just an absurd allegation.;In terms of the detainees, we've had thousands of people detained. We've investigated every single complaint against the detainees. It seemed like to me they based some of their decisions on the word of— and the allegations—by people who were held in detention, people who hate America, people that had been trained in some instances to disassemble [dissemble] *—that means not tell the truth. And so it was an absurd report. It just is. And you know—yes, sir.;Legislative Agenda;Q. Sir, you mentioned a moment ago a push-back. And there's a perception that Congress has been pushing back recently. My question is, do you worry that you might be losing a bit of momentum?;The President. Well, I'm—my attitude toward Congress is—will be reflected on whether or not they're capable of getting anything done. We got a good budget out of Congress, and we got some legal reform out of Congress. We got Priscilla Owen confirmed in the Senate, which is a positive thing. It looks like we'll get a couple of more judges on the appellate bench confirmed. But I think the standard by which Congress should be judged is whether or not they can get an energy bill, and I think they will. And I look forward to working with them on an energy bill.;Obviously—I mentioned CAFTA—we've got to get CAFTA, which is a very important trade agreement. It will be good for workers. And I'm looking forward to working with them on Social Security. Those are big issues that require action. Again, things don't happen instantly in Washington, DC. I know that part of your job is to follow the process and follow the politics and who's up and who's down, but I've been around here long enough now to tell you it's just—and tell the people listening—things just don't happen overnight. It takes a while.;And one thing is for certain, it takes a President willing to push people to do hard things. Because, keep in mind, we haven't had an energy strategy in this country for over a decade. And the Social Security issue hasn't been on the table since 1983— I mean, seriously on the table. And so I'm asking Congress to do some difficult things. And I'm going to keep asking them to do some difficult things. And I'm optimistic, when it's all said and done, that we will have come together and have helped solve some of these significant problems.;Q. Are you worried, sir, that you're losing some of your push?;The President. I don't worry about anything here in Washington, DC. I mean, I feel comfortable in my role as the President, and my role as the President is to push for reform. The American people appreciate a President who sees a problem and is willing to put it on the table.;Listen, admittedly, I could have taken the easy route and said, "Let's don't discuss Social Security until somebody else shows up in Washington." But that's not what the American people want from their President. And we have a serious problem in Social Security. Thalia asked about the Social Security issue, and I reminded her that the attitude is beginning to shift here in Washington, because for a while, people here said there really wasn't a significant problem and, "I wish he hadn't have brought it up." And now people are beginning to see the realities of Social Security and the fact that we're about to pass on a huge burden to a young generation of Americans—a burden, by the way, which doesn't have to be passed on. We can permanently solve Social Security and should permanently solve it. And I've laid out some initiatives to get us on the way to permanently solving Social Security.;I look forward to the day of sitting down with Republicans and Democrats and congratulating both political parties on doing what's right for the American people—a day, by the way, the American people expect to come as well.;VandeHei [Jim VandeHei, Washington Post].;Elections in Egypt/Uzbekistan;Q. Two questions about the consistency of a U.S. foreign policy that's built on the foundation of spreading democracy and ending tyranny. One, how come you have not spoken out about the violent crackdown in Uzbekistan, which is a U.S. ally in the war on terror, and why have you not spoken out in favor of the pro-democratic groups in Egypt that see the election process there unfolding in a way that is anything but democratic?;The President. Well, I thought I did the other day, in terms of the Egyptians. I think you were traveling with Laura, maybe just got back, but I was asked about the Egyptian elections, and I said we expect for the Egyptian political process to be open and that for people to be given a chance to express themselves open—in an open way, in a free way. We reject any violence toward those who express their dissension with the Government. Pretty confident I said that with President Abbas standing here—maybe not quite as articulately as just then.;In terms of Uzbekistan—thanks for bringing it up—we've called for the International Red Cross to go into the Andijon region to determine what went on, and we expect all our friends as well as those who aren't our friends to honor human rights and protect minority rights. That's part of a healthy and a peaceful world, will be a world in which governments do respect people's rights. And we want to know fully what took place there in Uzbekistan, and that's why we've asked the International Red Cross to go in.;Let's see—Carl [Carl Cameron, FOX News].;Nomination of John R. Bolton;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. On your nomination of Mr. Bolton to the United Nations, it is now, by most accounts, under a filibuster, the Democrats refusing to invoke cloture last week. I wonder if you could address their demands for ongoing documents, in the case of Mr. Bolton's nomination as well as what many Republicans have now criticized as a pervasive attitude of filibustering on behalf of the opposition on Capitol Hill.;The President. You know, I thought— I thought John Bolton was going to get an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, just like he deserves an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, and clearly he's got the votes to get confirmed. And so I was disappointed that once again, the leadership there in the Senate didn't give him an up-or-down vote. And the reason it's important to have an up-or-down vote is because we need to get our Ambassador to the United Nations to help start reforming that important organization.;As I mentioned to you, I think at the press conference in the East Room, that the reason I picked Bolton is he's a no-nonsense kind of fellow who can get things done. And we need to get something done in the United Nations. This is an organization which is important. It can help a lot in terms of the democracy movement, it can help deal with conflict and civil war. But it's an organization that is beginning to lose the trust of the American people, if it hasn't already, and therefore, we need to restore that trust. We pay over $2 billion a year into the United Nations, and it makes sense to have somebody there who's willing to say to the United Nations, "Let's—why don't you reform? Let's make sure that the body works well and there's accountability and taxpayers' money is spent wisely." And it's important that people in America trust the United Nations, and Bolton will be able to carry that message.;Now, in terms of the request for documents, I view that as just another stall tactic, another way to delay, another way to not allow Bolton to get an up-or-down vote. We have—we've answered questions after questions after questions. Documents were sent to the Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee reviewed the NSA intercept process and confirmed that Bolton did what was right. And so it's just a stalling tactic. And I would hope that when they get back that they stop stalling and give the man a vote. Just give him a simple up-or-down vote.;Q. What about the filibuster as a tactic, in general, sir?;The President. Well, it's certainly been a tactic that's been used on judges and Bolton, if this is a filibuster. I don't know what you call it. I'm not sure they actually labeled it filibuster. I'd call it—thus far, it's a stall—stall headed toward filibuster, I guess. All I know is the man is not getting a vote, and it's taking a long time to get his vote. And we've—he's been through hearings and questions and questionnaires. And it's pretty obvious to the American people and to me that you can tie up anything in the United States Senate if you want to. But it also ought to be clear that we need to get an ambassador to the United Nations as quickly as possible. And so I hope he gets a vote soon.;Dick [Richard Stevenson, New York Times].;Bioethics/Stem Cell Research;Q. Thank you, sir. Last week you made clear that you don't think there's any such thing as a spare embryo. Given that position, what is your view of fertility treatments that routinely create more embryos than ever result in full-term pregnancies? And what do you believe should be done with those embryos that never do become pregnancies or result in the birth of a child?;The President. As you know, I also had an event here at the White House with little babies that had been born as a result of the embryos that had been frozen— they're called "snowflakes"—indicating there's an alternative to the destruction of life.;But the stem cell issue, Dick, is really one of Federal funding. That's the issue before us and that—is whether or not we use taxpayers' money to destroy life in order to hopefully find cure for terrible disease. And I have made my position very clear on that issue, and that is I don't believe we should. Now, I made a decision a while ago that said there had been some existing stem cells, and therefore, it was okay to use Federal funds on those because the life decision had already been made. But from that point going forward, I felt it was best to stand on principle, and that is taxpayers' money to use—for the use of experimentation that would destroy life is a principle that violates something I—I mean, is a position that violates a principle of mine. And so—and I stand strong on that, to the point where I'll veto the bill as it now exists.;And having said that, it's important for the American people to know that there is some Federal research going on, on stem cells—embryonic stem cells today. There's been over 600 experiments based upon the stem cell lines that existed prior to my decision. There's another 3,000 potential experiments, they tell me, that can go forward. There's a lot of research going on, on adult stem cell research. We've got an ethics panel that has been—that is in place, that will help us, hopefully, develop ways to continue to figure out how to meet the demands of science and the need for ethics so that we can help solve some of these diseases.;And listen, I understand the folks that are deeply concerned for their—a child who might have juvenile diabetes. I know that the moms and dads across the country are in agony about the fate of their child. And my message to them is, is that there is research going on, and hopefully we'll find the cure. But at the same time, it's important in the society to balance ethics and science.;Ed [Ed Chen, Los Angeles Times].;North Korea;Q. Good morning, Mr. President. This morning you reiterated diplomacy as the way to deal with North Korea. With all due respect, some people say that's precisely the wrong approach because diplomacy has produced nothing, while at the same time it has allowed North Korea to progress in its nuclear program.;The President. Yes.;Q. How do you—what do you say to them?;The President. Well, then let's see. If it's the wrong—if diplomacy is the wrong approach, I guess that means military. That's how I view it. It's either diplomacy or military, and I am for the diplomacy approach. And so, for those who say that we ought to be using our military to solve the problem, I would say that, while all options are on the table, we've got a ways to go to solve this diplomatically, and——;Q. How long?;The President. Well, let me finish. No, I always get asked that, how long? How long are you going to do this? How long is that going to happen? Why don't you give us a timetable? I'm not giving timetables. I am going to say that we are— and it's very important for our partners to understand that I believe the six-party talks can and will work. We're constantly in touch with our Chinese counterparts. Sometimes people move a little slower than American society in the world. And sometimes expectations around the world are maybe different from ours. But fortunately, we've got everybody on the same page that says that the idea of North Korea having a nuclear weapon isn't good.;And by the way, that started with, as you know—might recall, the visit I had with Jiang Zemin in Crawford. And we came out of that visit with a common declaration that said it's in our interests that North Korea not have a nuclear weapon. And that was a positive step forward because once you get a country to commit to that goal, then it makes it—enables us to work together to achieve that goal in a peaceful way.;The other thing is, is that it's clear from the other five parties there—the other four parties in our five-party coalition dealing with the sixth party, which is North Korea—is that people do want to solve this issue diplomatically. And so it's a matter of continuing to send a message to Mr. Kim Chong-il that if you want to be accepted by the neighborhood and be a part of the—of those who are viewed with respect in the world, work with us to get rid of your nuclear weapons program.;Jonathan [Joe Curl, Washington Times].;Culture of Life;Q. Mr. President, you often talk about a culture of life and also about your responsibility as President to lead. Looking forward, what specific policy initiatives will you propose in the balance of your Presidency to expand the culture of life?;The President. Well, part of it, Jonathan, is just to—is to constantly remind people that we have a responsibility to the less— to the least of us in our society. I mean, part of a culture of life is to continue to expand the Faith-Based and Community-Based Initiative to help people who hurt. Part of it is to recognize that in a society that is as blessed as we are that we have a responsibility to help others, such as AIDS victims on the continent of Africa or people who hunger in sub-Sahara, for example.;So the culture of life is more than just an issue like embryonic stem cell. It's promoting a culture that is mindful that we can help—to help save lives through compassion. And my administration will continue to do so.;Let's see here. Oren [Oren Dorell, USA Today]. Fine-looking shades you got there.;North Korea;Q. Mr. President, back to North Korea for a second. Why has the United States scrapped the one link between our militaries when there's been no threat or harm to Americans participating in those missions to recover bodies of Americans killed in action during the Korean war there?;The President. The Secretary of Defense decided to take a—what he's referring to is, is that we have—I wouldn't called it "scrapped"—is that the verb you used? "Scrapped"?;Q. I did say that.;The President. Yes, scrapped. I would use a different verb. I would use "reassess" the mission. See, "scrapped" means that we're not going to do it ever again, I think is what that means. And what the Secretary of Defense has said, "Let me just take a look and make sure that as we send people into North Korea, that we're fully mindful of them being able to go in and get out." No immediate threat, just an assessment, is how I would put it. But thank you for the question.;Yes, John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].;Judicial Nominations;Q. Thank you, sir. Can you talk a little bit about the process you're using to pick your next Supreme Court Justice? And is that going to be affected at all by the agreement that was reached between the 14 Republicans and Democrats on judicial nominations?;The President. Well, that depends on whether or not the Senate will give my person an up-or-down vote. Here's my process. One, I'm obviously going to spend a lot of time reviewing the records of a variety of people and looking at their opinions and their character and will consult with Members of the United States Senate at the appropriate time.;I know there's been a lot of talk about consultation between the White House and the Senate, and we do consult—obviously, we consult on district judges—and that we listen to their opinions on appellate judges—"their" opinions being the opinions from the home-State Senators as well as others.;I look forward to talking to Members of the Senate about the Supreme Court process to get their opinions as well and will do so—and will do so. But obviously, it's—I told the American people I would find people of a certain temperament that would serve on the bench, and I intend to do that. But we will consult with the Senate.;Now, in terms of whether that agreement means that a Senator is going to get an up-or-down vote, I guess it was vague enough for people to interpret the agreement the way they want to interpret it. I'll put a best face on it, and that is that since they're moving forward with Judge Owen, for example, and others, that "extraordinary circumstances" means just that—really extraordinary. I don't know what that means. [ Laughter ] I guess we're about to find out when it comes to other appellate judges. [ Laughter ];But I was pleased to see Priscilla Owen get an up-or-down vote, and she passed quite comfortably. She's a very good judge. And then, of course, Pryor and Judge Brown will be coming up pretty soon, I hope, and I would hope they would get confirmed as well. They're good judges.;Herman [Ken Herman, Austin American-Statesman].;May 11 Security Alert;Q. Good morning, Mr. President.;The President. Thank you for that.;Q. Thank you. Back on May 11th, I believe was the date, as you were off campus for recreation, a small plane came into restricted airspace, the alarm went off here at your house, a military operation ensued over Washington. Your staff says you were not notified because that was the protocol. Two questions: Do you think you should have been notified, and is there something wrong with protocols that render the President unnecessary when there's a military operation over Washington?;The President. Obviously, we do have a protocol in place to be dealing with a situation that can unfold very rapidly. And these planes enter the airspace quickly, and so there's got to be something in place that can be dealt with in an expeditious matter. And we have such a plan, and I'm comfortable with the plan. And secondly, I was comfortable with the decision by the people around me there, out there in Maryland. Any time a situation like this comes up, people are constantly reviewing the situation, but I was very comfortable with the decision they made.;Q. Do you often disagree with your wife?;The President. Herman—[ laughter ]— here's the way it is. She often disagrees with me. [ Laughter ] Thank you very much, Herman, for that.;Matt Cooper [Time]. Here we go—no, go with the mike, Matt. We want you heard. We want you resonating around the country.;China-U.S. Relations;Q. I appreciate that, Mr. President, thank you. My question is about China, which looms larger in the lives of Americans, sir. They finance an ever-larger part of our trade deficit. Americans are concerned about China's growing economic might, and, of course, about the oppression of human rights and religious minorities there. My question, sir, is how should Americans think about China? As an ally? A rival? Competitor? Friend?;The President. I think that we ought— it is a—the relationship with China is a very complex relationship, and Americans ought to view it as such. China is a emerging nation. It's an amazing story to watch here. I mean, it's consuming more and more natural resources. It is generating jobs and exporting a lot of goods. It's a massive market.;And so, on one hand, we ought to look at China as an economic opportunity, and the best way to deal with China is to say, "Look, there are some rules, and we expect you to abide by the trade rules." And as this—as she grows and as trade becomes more complex, you'll see more and more instances where the United States is insisting upon fair trade. We expect our—expect to deal with—expect China to deal with the world trade in a fair way.;Now, in terms of security matters, obviously, we just spent a lot of time talking about North Korea. China can be a very good partner in helping to secure the world. The best way to convince Kim Chong-il to get up—give up his weapons is to have more than one voice saying the same thing. And therefore, China is a partner in this case, in terms of helping to secure that part of the world from nuclear weapons.;China as well can be helpful in the war on terror. They're just as concerned as we are on the war on terror.;China is a—obviously, there's tension on—about Taiwan that we have to deal with. And I made my position very clear and very consistent about Taiwan. The Taiwanese understand my position, the Chinese understand my position. So, in this case, the relationship is one of helping to solve that problem, is to keeping stability in the region so that eventually there will be a peaceful solution to that issue.;And so China is a fascinating country that is significant in its size. Its economy is still small but growing. But as well, I believe we have an obligation to remind the Chinese that any hopeful society is one in which there's more than just economic freedom, that there's religious freedom and freedom of the press. And so, in my meetings with the different Chinese leaders with whom I've had the honor of meeting, I've always brought up issues such as the Dalai Lama or the Catholic Church's inability to get a bishop into the country or the need for the country not to fear evangelicals but to understand religious freedom leads to peace. And so I'll continue doing that so long as I'm the President and, at the same time, help deal with this very complex relationship.;Let's see here—David Greene [Baltimore Sun]. Did you have your hand up?;Historical Assessment of Iraq;Q. I did, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. President. At the Naval Academy last week, you spoke of a midshipman named Edward Slavis, who graduated and has served in Iraq. And you quoted him as saying that the mission will be a success, and 20 or 30 years from now, historians will look back on it and consider it America's golden moment.;The President. Yes.;Q. I'm wondering, sir, if you agree with that assessment, and, if so, why?;The President. I do, David, because I believe that as a result of the actions we have taken, we have laid—begun to lay the foundation for a democratic movement that will outlast this administration, a democratic movement that will bring peace to a troubled part of the world.;I—you probably suffered through this part of my speech on the campaign a lot when I talked about my relationship with Koizumi. And since you haven't heard it for a while, I thought I'd bring it up again. I know. Okay, Stretch, look, it's nice and warm, it's a good chance for you to hear the story again. [ Laughter ];You know, I reminded people that because Japan is a democracy, Japan is now a great friend. We work together on big issues, and yet it wasn't all that long ago that we warred with Japan. In other words, democracies have the capability of transforming nations. That's what history has told us. And I have faith in the ability of democracy to transform nations. And that's why, when I talked about Iraq earlier, that we've laid the—begun to lay the foundation for a democratic, peaceful Iraq. Someday, an American President is going to be dealing with an Iraqi—elected Iraqi President, saying—or Prime Minister, saying, "What we can we do together to bring peace to the region?" In other words, it's a platform for peace. And yes, I do believe—I agreed with the man.;These are incredibly hopeful times and very difficult times. And the problem is, is that I not only see the benefits of democracy, but so do the terrorists. And that's why they want to blow people up, indiscriminately kill, in order to shake the will of the Iraqis or perhaps create a civil war or to get us to withdraw early. That's what they're trying to do, because they fear democracy. They understand what I just— they understand what I understand, there's kind of a meeting of minds on that. And that's why the American people are seeing violent actions on their TV screens, because these people want to—the killers want us to get out. They want us to—they want the Iraqis to quit. They understand what a democracy can mean to their backward way of thinking.;So I do agree with the man. I thought it was a pretty profound statement, and I was pleased to be able to share it with the folks there at Annapolis.;A couple of more, then I got to hop. Keith [Keith Koffler, Congress Daily]. I get to leave. That's not a very—a couple of more, and then I have to retire, as opposed to hopping.;Social Security Reform;Q. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Sir, most Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate with you on Social Security until you take payroll-tax-funded personal accounts off the table. Would you insist on these accounts if it means no deal on Social Security?;The President. We're just beginning the process, and I want to remind people that—who might be listening that this is not an easy issue for people in Washington, DC, to discuss. There's a lot of people calculating the political consequences of making a tough vote, you know. Or they're— they remember the old campaigns of the past where if you even talk about Social Security, somebody will use your words to try to defeat you at the polls.;So this is a process here, and in that you love to follow the process, I will give you some insight into what I think is going to happen in the process. It's just going— it's like water cutting through a rock. It's just a matter of time. We're just going to keep working and working and working, reminding the American people that we have a serious problem and a great opportunity to act not as politicians but as states men and women to solve a problem.;And so—oh, I know, I've read about so-and-so, "We're not going to talk about this," and, "We're going to throw down this marker." But in the meantime, the people are watching Washington, and nothing is happening, except you got a President who's willing to talk about the issue and a President who, by the way, is going to keep talking about the issue until we get people to the table.;I repeat to you, Keith, the Social Security issue is a really important issue for an upcoming generation. I mean, imagine realizing that we've got a problem and then not doing anything about it and watching a young generation get taxed, perhaps by as much as a payroll tax of 18 percent. How would that make somebody feel? That we shirked our duty, that we weren't responsible citizens.;Secondly, we've been at this for a couple of months, looking forward, and it takes a while in Washington, DC. Now, I know people want things done tomorrow—or yesterday, and if they're not done, they say, "Well, the thing has fallen apart." That's not the experience I've had in Washington, DC. I can remember the tax debate, where things didn't happen quite as quickly as some liked, but nevertheless, we got something done. And I'm convinced we're going to get other things done here in Washington.;But the President has got to push. He's got to keep leading, and that's exactly what I'm going to do. And when we get something done, there will be plenty of time to share the credit. People—to me, this is an issue that is one in which people from both parties ought to take great pride in coming to the table to get something done.;One thing is for certain: The party that I represent is leading. I mean, we're willing to take the lead and say, "Here's what we believe. Here's why we believe it," willing to take a message to the American people that is a positive message and one that says, "We recognize a problem. Now let's work together to solve it." And so I think as people make their calculations, that I think the American people are going to end up saying to those who have been willing to lead on the issue and talk about the issue and be constructive on the issue, "Thanks for what you're doing, and we'll send you back up there with our vote, because that's the kind of spirit we like.;Listen, thank you all for coming out. Enjoyed it.</td></tr>

Bush: The President's Radio Address</td><td class="c6">June 4, 2005</td><td class="c7">Good morning. America's economy is on the right track. Over the past 2 years, we've added more than 3.5 million new jobs. More Americans are working today than ever before. Homeownership is at an all-time high. Small businesses are flourishing. Factory output is growing. And families are taking home more of what they earn.;These are hopeful signs for our economy, and we must work hard to sustain that prosperity. When Members of Congress return next week, they need to take action on four key priorities for the American people.;First, Congress needs to complete an energy bill. America is growing more dependent on foreign oil, and that is driving up the price of gasoline across the country. For the past 4 years, I've called on Congress to pass legislation that encourages energy conservation, promotes domestic production in environmentally friendly ways, funds research into new technologies to help us diversify away from foreign oil, and modernizes the electricity grid. I applaud the House for passing an energy bill. Now the American people expect the Senate to act, so I can sign a good energy bill into law by August.;Second, Americans expect Congress to be wise with their money. I proposed a disciplined Federal budget that makes tax relief permanent, holds the growth in discretionary spending below the rate of inflation, and reduces discretionary spending for nonsecurity programs. The House and the Senate have worked together to pass a responsible budget resolution that keeps us on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. Now Congress must keep its promise to exercise restraint on spending bills and to rein in mandatory spending. The principle is clear: Every taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely or not at all.;Third, Congress needs to ratify the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA. On Monday, I will travel to Florida to discuss CAFTA with leaders throughout the hemisphere. I look forward to telling them that CAFTA is a good deal for workers, farmers, and small businesses in the United States and throughout the hemisphere. About 80 percent of products from Central America and the Dominican Republic now enter the United States duty free. Yet American exports to those countries face hefty tariffs. CAFTA will level the playing field by making about 80 percent of American exports to Central America and the Dominican Republic duty free. CAFTA will lower barriers in key sectors like textiles, which will make American manufacturers more competitive in the global market. And CAFTA will make our neighborhood more secure by strengthening young democracies. CAFTA is a practical, pro-jobs piece of legislation, and Congress needs to pass it soon.;Finally, Congress needs to move forward with Social Security reform. This past week, I traveled to Kentucky to talk about Social Security. Next Wednesday, I will discuss Social Security with builders and contractors in Washington, DC. At each stop, I remind seniors they will continue to receive their Social Security checks every month. I also remind everyone that Social Security is in serious trouble for our children and grandchildren. Americans of all ages have made it clear they expect their leaders in Washington to strengthen Social Security for future generations.;By taking action on all these priorities, Congress will strengthen the long-term economic security of the American people. Americans expect members of both parties to set aside partisan differences and get things done. I look forward to working with Congress to achieve results in the days ahead.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks to the Opening Session of the Organization of American States General Assembly in Fort Lauderdale, Florida</td><td class="c6">June 6, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thank you all very much. Welcome to the United States. Thanks for having me. Madam Secretary, thank you for your service, thank you for your friendship, thank you for your short introduction. [ Laughter ];Ambassador Maisto, Members of the United States Congress—four members, by the way, of the Florida delegation have joined us today, and I'm grateful that they have come. Secretary General Insulza, thank you, congratulations. Thank you for coming by the Oval Office the other day to give me a briefing. Assistant Secretary General, thank you, sir. It's good to see you again. Distinguished visitors and guests. I'm honored to be here at this meeting of the Organization of American States.;The ties that bind the Americas are particularly vivid here in Florida. I mean, if you spend any time in this State, you'll find people from all over our hemisphere who live here. This State has benefited because immigrants from throughout the hemisphere have made their homes here. I know firsthand—I'm pretty familiar with the State's Governor. [ Laughter ] He keeps me abreast of what's taking place in this State.;You know, our ties are represented in different ways. Perhaps you know this, but my brother was lucky enough to marry a fantastic woman from Mexico, the first lady of Florida is Mexican-born. A United States Senator from Florida, Mel Martinez, was born in Cuba. No, the ties in our hemisphere between America and our hemisphere are particularly strong in Florida. It's a perfect place to have the meeting. Thank you for choosing Florida.;As I look out at the distinguished foreign ministers, I find we have much in common. We're the children of the New World, founded in empire and fulfilled in independence. Our people are united by history and geography. And the United States shares a commitment with you to build an Americas that live in liberty, trades in freedom, and grows in prosperity.;We come together at a great moment in history, when freedom is on the march around our world. In the last year-and-a-half—think about this—we've witnessed a Rose Revolution in Georgia, an Orange Revolution in Ukraine, a Purple Revolution in Iraq, a Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, a Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, and these are just the beginnings. Across central Asia, hope is stirring at the prospect of change, and change will come. Across the broader Middle East, we are seeing the rise of a new generation whose hearts burn for freedom, and they will have it.;This love of liberty has long roots in our own hemisphere. Not long after the United States won its independence from Britain, patriots throughout the Americas were inspired to take their own stand. One of them was an Argentine general named Jose de San Martin. During the struggle for independence from Spain, the general declared, "In the last corner of the Earth that I might find myself, I will be ready to sacrifice my existence for liberty.;San Martin's dream of liberty has found a home in the Organization of American States. This organization's founding documents calls the Americas to its "historic mission to offer to man a land of liberty and a favorable environment for the realization of his just aspirations." That mission was given its clear direction in the Inter-American Democratic Charter declaring that "the peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy, and their governments have an obligation to promote it and defend it." And today, what was once a distant dream is now within our reach, an Americas wholly free and democratic and at peace with ourselves and our neighbors.;In the new Americas of the 21st century, democracy is now the rule, rather than the exception. Think of the dramatic changes we've seen in our lifetime. In 1974, the last time the OAS General Assembly met in the United States, fewer than half its members had democratically elected governments. Today, all 34 countries participating in this General Assembly have democratic, constitutional governments.;Only one country in this hemisphere sits outside this society of democratic nations, and one day, the tide of freedom will reach Cuba's shores as well. The great Cuban patriot Jose Marti said it best, "La libertad no es negociable.;The dramatic gains for democracy we have witnessed in our hemisphere must not be taken for granted. Democratic change and free elections are exhilarating events. Yet we know from experience they can be followed by moments of uncertainty. When people risk everything to vote, it can raise expectations that their lives will improve immediately, but history teaches us that the path to a free and prosperous society is long and not always smooth. Each nation must follow its own course, according to its own history. Yet the old and new democracies of the Americas share a common interest in showing every citizen of our hemisphere that freedom brings not just peace, it brings a better life for themselves and their families.;In the new Americas of the 21st century, bringing a better life to our people requires choosing between two competing visions. One offers a vision of hope. It is founded on representative government, integration into the world markets, and a faith in the transformative power of freedom in individual lives. The other seeks to roll back the democratic progress of the past two decades by playing to fear, pitting neighbor against neighbor, and blaming others for their own failures to provide for their people. The choices we make will determine which vision will define the Americas our children inherit. We must make wise decisions today to ensure a better tomorrow.;To give our children a better tomorrow, our citizens must see that democracy delivers more than promises. They need to see in their daily lives that their hard work and enterprises are rewarded. They need to see that in a democratic society, people can walk in the streets safely, corruption is punished, and all citizens are equal before the law. And when the people of the Americas see that opportunity and social mobility are real, they will know that in a free and democratic society, the only limit to how far they can go is the size of their dreams.;The United States believes it has an obligation to help build this better tomorrow for all the citizens. Working with our partners in the region, my Government has helped the leaders of this hemisphere meet our goal of delivering treatment to 600,000 HIV sufferers across the region. In 2002, the United States launched the Millennium Challenge Account to help poor nations and to revolutionize the concept of development aid. My administration's approach is based on this commonsense idea that development aid works best in countries that are proving their commitment to govern justly, to invest in their citizens, and to open up their economies. Under this program, aid will go to those who deliver results for their people.;Next week, Honduras will become the second country to sign a Millennium Challenge compact—for a $215 million program that will help Honduran farmers grow better crops, as well as money to build highways that will open markets for them around the region and the world.;To advance economic development in the Americas, the U.S. Government already makes about $5 billion in loans and grants to the region throughout [through] * the Ex-Im Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade and Development Agency. In preparation for the Summit of the Americas later this year in Argentina, my administration will be looking for new ways to prime the real engines of hope in the Americas, its small businesses and private enterprises and entrepreneurs. When people throughout the Americas see their lives improve and opportunity more abundant, their faith in democracy will grow and our hemisphere will be more secure.;In the new Americas of the 21st century, one of the surest ways to make opportunity real for all our citizens is by opening our doors to trade. My Government is pursuing this goal at all levels, at the global level through the Doha round of the World Trade Organization, at the regional level through the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and at the bilateral level with free trade agreements with individual countries like Chile and Mexico and Canada. And the United States Congress is now considering the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, which offers an historic opportunity to bring prosperity to the citizens of our hemisphere who have not known it.;For the young democracies of Central America, CAFTA would bring new investment, and that means good jobs and higher labor standards for their workers. In these nations, wealthier citizens already enjoy access to goods and services produced abroad. By reducing tariffs on U.S. goods, all consumers in these countries will enjoy better goods at lower prices. These lower prices will also give Central American small businesses and farmers and entrepreneurs less costly access to U.S. machinery and equipment, which will make them more competitive and help their economies grow. By bringing economic growth to Central America, CAFTA will contribute to the rise of a vibrant middle class. And that makes us reach—a step closer to our goal, a goal of the Americas where the opportunities in San Jose, Costa Rica, are as real as they are in San Jose, California.;For U.S. farmers and businesses and workers, CAFTA would expand opportunity by creating a more level playing field for our goods and services. Under existing rules, most of Central America's exports already enter the United States duty free, but U.S. exports still face hefty tariffs. By passing CAFTA, the United States would open up a market of 44 million consumers for our farmers and small-business people. CAFTA will replace a system that is often arbitrary with one that is fair and transparent and based on common rules.;For the Western Hemisphere, CAFTA would continue to advance the stability and security that come from freedom. An Americas linked by trade is less likely to be divided by resentment and false ideologies. An Americas where all our people live in prosperity will be more peaceful. And an Americas whose countries have reduced the barriers to trade among ourselves will be a more competitive region in a global economy.;CAFTA is more than just a trade agreement, it is a signal of the U.S. commitment to democracy and prosperity for our neighbors, and I urge the United States Congress to pass it.;In the last half-century, the nations of the Americas have overcome enormous challenges, colonialism and communism and military dictatorship. At the start of this new century, these divisions have fallen away, and now we have it within our means to eliminate the scourge of poverty from our hemisphere. In this room, we still represent many different countries with different traditions and different mother tongues, but today we can say with pride that we all speak the common language of liberty. And by making the blessings of freedom real in our hemisphere, we will set a shining example for the rest of the world.;Thank you for letting me come by. Que Dios los bendiga. May God bless you all.</td></tr>

Mr. President, thanks for the great introduction, and thanks for having me. It's an honor to be here at Penn State University, one of the great universities in our country. I want to thank the president of this fine university, President Spanier, for having us. Thank you for letting me come here on this beautiful campus.;Guess what happened? There was a pretty famous person at the airport today. [ Laughter ] And so I said, "Why don't you ride over to the college campus with me here, the university campus. I need a briefing on what's going on." And Joe Paterno kindly agreed to travel with me. I said, "Let's talk football." He said, "Why don't you tell me what's going on in Washington." [ Laughter ] I tell you one thing about Joe Paterno, there's no more decent fellow on the face of the Earth—what a man who sets high standards. He loves his family. He loves this university. He loves his country, and my mother and dad love him. Coach, thanks for coming, proud you're here.;I appreciate the FFA a lot. I appreciate the fact that the Pennsylvania FFA has made a table for the Crawford, Texas, FFA. I'm looking forward to telling the folks there at Crawford how decent the good folks here are in Pennsylvania. I really want to thank you for that gesture. I bet they like that table. I'm a little disappointed you didn't make the table for me. [ Laughter ];But thanks for what you—thanks for the example you have set. Thanks for understanding the importance of values. I mean, one thing that's really important about our farming communities all across the country is that in our farming communities you find the values of hard work, faith, love of family, and love of our country. And I want to thank you all for carrying on that tradition of carrying those values.;I'm sorry my wife isn't here.;Audience members. Aw-w-w!;The President. Yes, I know, most people are sorry—[ laughter ]—she's not here instead of me. But she is doing great. I'm a lucky man when Laura said, "I do." She is a fabulous First Lady, a great mom, and a great wife. And she sends her very best.;I want to thank the Governor of the great State of Pennsylvania for joining us today, Governor Rendell. I'm proud you're here, and thank you for serving.;I am traveling with members of the mighty Pennsylvania congressional delegation. First, Senator Arlen Specter—I appreciate you being here, Mr. Chairman. Senator Specter is battling cancer with incredible courage, and I appreciate your allegiance. I'm proud to be with Senator Rick Santorum, a graduate of Penn State University. Congressman John Peterson from this area. John, thank you for joining us.;Dennis Wolff, the secretary of agriculture from Pennsylvania, I appreciate you being here, Dennis. I want to thank Chris Herr, the president of the Pennsylvania FFA Foundation. I want to thank Mike Brammer, the executive manager. Most of all, I want to thank you all for letting me come by.;You know, when I landed, I met another person, named Mickey Peters. The reason I bring up Mickey is she is a volunteer with the Centre County Cooperative Extension 4-H program. She has been a volunteer for more than 40 years and helping instill values and reminding all of us that we have a commitment to serve our respective communities. The reason I bring up Mickey is because, if you're interested in serving your country, your State, or your community, volunteer. See, the great strength of this country lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens. If you want to truly be a patriot in America, feed the hungry, find shelter for the homeless, love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself. Mickey, thank you for coming, and thank you for the example you have set.;I am particularly grateful to come to speak to younger Americans and a few older ones here I see scattered around. [ Laughter ] We're living in historic times. These are amazing times. And I hope you're as excited about them as I am. I wish I could tell you this wasn't the truth— the case, but the case is, we're still fighting the war against terrorists. It's a different kind of war. But it's a necessary war, because our most solemn duty is to protect the homeland.;Our strategy is clear: We will stay on the offensive against the enemy. We will find them where they hide. We will bring them to justice. We will defeat them in foreign lands so we do not have to face them here at home. And for those of you with a relative in the United States military, I want you to do me a favor and thank them on behalf of the Commander in Chief, but more importantly, thank them on behalf of a grateful nation for their sacrifice and service.;The second part of our strategy to defeat terror, to spread the peace, is to spread liberty, is to help those courageous souls who demand the God-given right to live in a free society. Freedom is on the march around the world now. We're living in amazing times when millions of people in Afghanistan, when given a chance, went to the polls to say, "We want to live in a free society." Freedom is on the march in places like Lebanon and Ukraine. Freedom has taken hold in Georgia. Freedom has taken hold in Lebanon. Freedom has taken hold in Iraq, where 8.5 million citizens defied suiciders and killers to say with a loud voice to the world, "We want to be free." And a free society is a necessary part of spreading the peace.;So as you watch the dramatic changes taking place in the world, keep in mind we're laying the foundation for a peaceful world, a world in which boys and girls from all cultures and all countries can realize their dreams, can live in a free society. There's no doubt in my mind this world will be better off as freedom spreads. And I'm proud that the United States of America is taking the lead in spreading democracy and freedom around the world.;There are dramatic times here at home. As you know, there are dramatic changes in agriculture taking place. Now, farming is still the first industry in America. It is a luxury that we live in a country that can feed ourselves, and we need to keep it that way. The American agriculture is diverse, and it's a complex industry, where family farmers are CEOs, where the occupations in agriculture run from engineering and food science to business management and to biotechnology. Which says to me, you better take advantage of the educations you got. Which says, you got to learn, you got to set high standards and work hard, read more than you watch TV, take your teachers seriously because you're going to need a good education in order to be able to compete in this world.;We started our—we made good progress for the agriculture community by this farm bill I was honored to sign 3 years ago. This is a farm bill that provided a strong safety net for our farmers. It allows farmers and ranchers to plan and to operate based upon market realities, not Government dictates. You see, we tried to reduce Government interference in the agricultural market and, at the same time, create incentives for sound conservation practices. The bill I signed and the Congress passed has helped strengthen the farm economy and promoted independence by our farmers and helped preserve the farming way of life. And now we've got to build on the successes.;I've got a good man as the Secretary of Agriculture in Mike Johanns. He actually grew up on a farm. Some of you will be pleased to hear he grew up on a dairy farm. He's going to be speaking to an FFA group in Illinois. He's going to be listening to farmers and ranchers all across our country as we prepare for a new farm bill. But one thing is for certain—he doesn't need to travel the country for me to understand this: In order for the agricultural sector of America to be strong, we got to keep your taxes low.;The tax relief we passed has helped our economy overcome a lot of challenges. The small-business sector is strong today because small businesses are paying fewer Federal taxes. The entrepreneurial spirit is strong today because of the tax relief. More people are working today in America than ever before in our Nation's history. The national unemployment rate is 5.1 percent. We're making good progress. But in order to make sure this progress continues, Congress needs to make the tax relief we passed permanent.;And speaking about tax relief, in order to make sure our farms stay within our farming families, we need to get rid of the death tax once and for all. It makes no sense to tax a person's assets twice, once while they're living and again after they die. For the sake of family farmers, Congress needs to get rid of the death tax forever.;To keep agriculture strong, to make sure these good folks have a chance to make a good living in the agricultural sector, we need to continue to open up new markets abroad. I always told the American people, "If you're good at something, let's promote it." We're really good at growing things, so why don't we grow things and sell them abroad? I mean, we've got enough food to feed ourselves, so it seems like to me to be a good strategy to open up markets so others can buy our crops, our soybeans and our corn, our products we grow right here at home.;My administration supports trade initiatives that level the playing field, and one such initiative is the Central American Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, which is coming before the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. Let me tell you why I think this is a good deal for all Americans as well as our farmers and ranchers. Right now the United States is open to more than 80 percent of the goods being sold out of Central America into our own markets, and yet 80 percent of our goods don't have equal access to their markets, markets of about 44 million people. Catch this: The United States is already open to more than 99 percent of Central America's agricultural products. In other words, we've opened up our market, but our farm exports to Central America are losing ground every day to third countries that have got trade deals with these nations.;As your President, it seems like to make sense to me to say, "If we treat you this way, you treat us"—that's what fair trade is all about. By opening up Central American markets, it will help our farmers. The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that CAFTA could boost our agricultural exports by $1.5 billion, when fully implemented. For the sake of fairness and for the sake of the agricultural economy, the United States Congress needs to pass the CAFTA trade agreement now.;To keep American agriculture strong, we need to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable, reliable, and secure supplies of energy. You know, when I first came to Washington, DC, nearly 4 years ago—a little over 4 years ago—I knew we had a problem with energy. See, we're too dependent on foreign sources of energy. So we developed a strategy that would make us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And by the way, one reason why you're seeing your gasoline prices go up, why farmers are paying higher fertilizer prices, why it costs more to fill your tractor, is because we're dependent on foreign sources of energy.;And so I said to the United States Congress, "Why don't we get wise about our energy policy." Why don't we do things differently. Why don't we encourage conservation. Why don't we make sure we spend money so we can have clean coal technology, so we can use the coal resources of a State like Pennsylvania in our electricity plants that has zero emissions. Why don't we continue research and development, so we can use soybeans or corn to develop new sources of energy.;I was at a plant the other day in Virginia. It was a soy diesel refinery. They're taking crops grown right here in America, putting them in the refinery, and out comes a fuel that we can use in diesel engines.;We need to be using clean, safe nuclear power. We need to make sure that the United States of America diversifies away from a hydrocarbon society so we're no longer dependent on foreign sources of energy. The House has passed a bill. The Senate will have the bill on the floor. This Congress needs to stop debating energy policy and get a bill to my desk before the August recess break.;Now, I want to talk about one other subject that the young here need to pay attention to, and that's the Social Security issue. First, you know, some people have said to me in Washington, "Why did you bring it up? Why did you talk about such a politically difficult subject?" Well, here's why. I think there's a problem. I'm about to explain why there is a problem. But I also know what the nature of the job of the Presidency is. The job of the President is to confront problems and not pass those problems on to future Presidents and future Congresses. The easy path is to do nothing. That's the easy political path. The tough path is to come together and get something done. But let me tell you something: By doing nothing, you're about to hear that we will have done a disservice to a younger group of Americans coming up.;Franklin Roosevelt did a wise thing when he created the Social Security system. Social Security has been an important safety net for a lot of seniors. And for seniors receiving a check today, I want to assure you you're going to continue to get your check. The system is solvent for our seniors. You have nothing to worry about. I know all the political ads and the propaganda. I'm sure, Governor, you've had to put up with that occasionally. But the truth is—the truth is, if you're born prior to 1950, you're going to get your check. I don't care what the politicians say.;Here's the problem. The problem exists for a young generation of Americans. And the reason why is there are a bunch of people getting ready to retire. We're called baby boomers. I'm one. I was born in 1946. I reach retirement age in 2008. It's a convenient year for me to reach retirement age. [ Laughter ] The problem is there's a lot of people like me getting ready to retire. Do you realize today there are about 40 million retirees receiving benefits? By the time the baby boomers retire, there's going to be about 72 million of us receiving benefits. We got a whole lot of people getting ready to retire.;And we're living longer. My generation will live longer than the previous generation. Coach Paterno said, "Are you exercising a lot, Mr. President?" I said, "All the time, Coach. I'm trying to live longer than the previous generation.;And not only that, but when people were running for Congress in previous years, they'd say, "Vote for me. I'll make sure your benefits go up faster than the rate of inflation." And that's what happened. That's one of those political promises that was kept. So you've got a lot of baby boomers like me, a whole lot of us, going to be living longer, getting greater benefits than the previous generation, which is all fine and good until you realize the other half of the equation.;Now, in 1950, early fifties, there was about 16 workers for every beneficiary, which meant the load wasn't all that heavy when you're paying your payroll tax to take care of a beneficiary. Today, there's 3.3 workers per beneficiary. When a lot of these kids get older, there's going to be 2 workers per beneficiary. You've got fewer workers, fewer people taking care of people like me who will be living longer and receiving greater benefits. And that's the problem.;In 2017, there will be more money going out than coming in. And every year thereafter, it gets worse. In 2027, there will be about a $200-billion-a-year shortfall. And it gets worse until finally, 2041, the system would be bankrupt.;So we're looking at a bankrupt system for younger workers. We're asking younger workers to pay payroll tax, to pay hard-earned money into a system that's going broke. That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair, to know the facts and not do something about it. And so that's why I went in front of the United States Congress and I said, "We've got a problem. The problem—the facts are irrefutable, and now we need to do something about it." I said, "Why don't we get rid of all the partisan bickering in Washington, DC, and come together for the good of a generation of people coming up.;I believe I have more—a responsibility more than just bringing the problem out there. And so I have talked about solutions, and I'd like to share some of my thoughts with you. First, a reformed system—now, remember, if you're getting your check, I'm not talking to you. Nothing changes for people receiving their checks. I met a lot of grandmothers and grandfathers who kind of went, "Thank goodness, I'm going to get my check." And then, you know what the next question is? They say, "What are you going to do about my grandkids, Mr. President? What do you and the Congress intend to do about a group of youngsters getting ready to go into the workplace?" So I said, "The first we got to do in a reformed system is to say to future generations, ‘You'll receive benefits equal to or greater than the benefits today's seniors get."' Seems to make sense to me.;Secondly, I said a reformed system must reassure future generations that those who depend most on Social Security will have the most protection in their retirement. In other words, I don't believe anybody ought to retire into poverty. I don't believe we ought to have a system where somebody is working all their life, and then they get a check, and it keeps them in poverty. That doesn't make sense to me.;And so I've adopted the idea put out by a Democrat named Robert Pozen. I think Mr. Pozen has got a good idea, and here's what it says. It says that the Social Security checks for the highest 1 percent of Americans will remain the same in today's dollars as the checks received by beneficiaries today. It means no cut in benefits to the upper 1 percent. The other 99 percent of American workers will get bigger checks in today's dollars than the current retirees, which means an increase in benefits. The top 1 percent earners would have their benefits go up at the cost of living. The lower income Americans would have their benefits go up with wages, and it would be scaled in between. And that's important because, you see, if Congress were just to adopt that part of the proposal, it would solve, by far, the biggest problem we face in funding Social Security for the out-years.;Now, it takes other measures, and I want to work with Republicans and Democrats to look at other ways to make the system permanently fixed.;We've got some folks here that are dairy farmers. Jeff Grove, and his son, Caleb, are with us. Jeff is a third-generation dairy farmer. Caleb will start his first year with FFA this fall in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania. Jeff and his brother, Jay, run the family farm. By the way, their mom, Anna, is here. Boys, listen to your mother.;Caleb wants to join the family business when he's finished school. If he chooses to, Jeff could retire at 65 and start drawing benefits in 2021. Under a system with progressive indexing, he could expect a benefit of over $12,000 a year in today's dollars— today's dollars—compared to about $11,000 in today's dollars for a similar worker. In other words, the program would be beneficial to Jeff. That means after adjusting for inflation, his benefits would be 10 percent higher.;What I'm trying to do is to tell you the system that Mr. Pozen has proposed goes a long way toward fixing the system, but it's a good deal for people paying into the system today.;If Caleb turns out to be a farmer just like his dad, he can expect an annual benefit of more than $15,700 in today's dollars. In other words, the system helps us achieve what we want, permanent solvency and to say you're not going to retire into poverty. That makes sense. Under the reform proposed by Mr. Pozen, 99 percent of Americans will see their benefits grow, and no one's benefits will be cut.;It's important for Congress, if they've got a better idea, to bring it up. If you think you can do better in solving this problem, I don't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, put your ideas on the table. That's why they sent you to Washington, DC, in the first place.;So, I've got some ideas to permanently solve the Social Security deficit and the problem, so we can say to youngsters, "When you work and pay something into the payroll system, there will be something for you when you retire." And I've got another idea that I want Congress to consider, and that I want people in this country to listen to carefully. And it's to make sure the system is a better deal for younger workers.;Now, first, let me describe how Social Security actually works. It's called a pay-as-you-go system. You work hard, and you pay through payroll taxes, and we go ahead and spend. We spend on the benefits for retirees, and then, with the money left over, we spend on programs. See, some people think, well, the Social Security system is one where we take your money, and we hold it for you, and then when you retire, we give it back. That's not the way it works. You pay. We pay out the money for the retirees, and the money left over—see, there's money left over until 2017—it goes ahead and funds all the different programs of Government. And do you know what's left behind? Paper, IOUs in a file cabinet in West Virginia. [ Laughter ] Those are the assets of the Social Security system.;In order to make sure there's real assets in Social Security, I think we ought to allow younger workers, if they so choose, to take some of their own payroll taxes and set up a voluntary personal savings account. I think it makes sense to encourage people to build a nest egg they call their own— by the way, a nest egg the Government cannot take away, a nest egg the Government can't take and spend on programs that they like.;I'll tell you why it makes sense to allow younger workers to take some of their own money as a part of a Social Security system, if that's what they so choose, is because people can get a pretty good rate of return on a conservative mix of stocks and bonds or a portfolio of bonds only. A conservative mix of stocks and bonds can yield you 4.6 percent. By the way, you get about 1.8 percent on your money in the Government. It's a lousy rate of return compared to what a conservative mix of bonds and stocks will get you.;And the important thing about earning 4.6 percent is that over time, your money compounds. It grows, and that's important. If you're a youngster and you start saving some of your own payroll taxes—and I say, by "some of your own payroll taxes," sometimes if you listen to the rhetoric in Washington, it sounds like the people there believe the payroll tax is the Government's money. It's not the Government's money, it's the people's money. The people are working hard for that money.;Let me just give you an example. Suppose one of your brothers or sisters becomes a farmer and marries a food scientist, and they earn typical wages from both those professions. And you enter the workforce in 2011, and you work your entire career. And you're allowed to put a third of your payroll taxes aside, and it grows at 4.6 percent and compounds over time. By the time you retire, you'll have a nest egg of $570,000—your money. It's a part of a Social Security system. It would supplement your Social Security checks, but it's your money. No one can take it away from you. It's your money. It's money you can pass on to whomever you choose. And that's an important part of an ownership society in America.;It's important—let me tell you—let me give you an example of the Social Security system today that I think is patently unfair. You've got two folks working in their family. One of them dies before age 62. You know what the Government pays? Burial benefits, period. And then when the other spouse reaches a retirement age, he or she gets to choose the benefits from her work or his work or the spouse's work, which is ever higher, but not both. In other words, the way the system works today, you've worked all your life, and you predecease your spouse, and the spouse's benefits are greater than yours would have been, the money you earned just goes away.;That doesn't seem fair to me, that you've got Americans all across the country working hard to put bread on the table, and they get a bad break, and they die early, and the money they've contributed to the Social Security system just isn't around for the surviving spouse.;It seems like to me it makes sense to let workers, if they so choose, to take some of their own money and put it aside in a personal savings account. And if something bad happens, like early death, there would be some assets for the surviving spouse, assets he or she could live on to help the family, assets to help with the grief, and assets to make their life better in retirement.;No, the idea of giving younger workers the ability to take some of their own money and set it aside so they can watch their money grow is an idea that's already taken hold here in America. Some of us older guys, like Specter and Rendell and others here, when we were coming up, we weren't sure what a 401(k) was. There weren't any. We didn't know what IRAs were in those days. There's a whole investor class of people growing up in America, people who are used to watching their money grow. And it seems to make sense to me to make sure a modernized, reformed Social Security system for a young generation of Americans ought to incorporate this idea, if that's what they choose to do, as a part of a modern retirement system.;This isn't a new idea, by the way, in Washington, DC. I think you'll find this interesting—at least I certainly did when I started looking in on the issue—is that the United States Congress has set up what is called a Thrift Savings Plan. It's a plan that lets United States Senators and Members of the House of Representatives set aside some of their own money in a conservative mix of bonds and stocks. You know what I think? I think if that plan is good enough for Members of the United States Congress, it's good enough for workers all across America.;I've come today to tell you that there are some of us in Washington, DC, who do not want to leave you saddled with a retirement system that's going broke, that we realize we have an obligation to address this problem. I'm enjoying traveling the country talking about the Social Security issue. It gives me a chance to get out of Washington, gives me a chance to remind the skeptics and critics that there are people in Washington, DC, who care about the common good, that care about addressing problems. There are people in that Nation's Capital that have gone there for the right reason, to focus on the people's business and to come up with solutions, so that when it's all said and done, no matter what your party might be, we can say, "Job well done. We came to Washington—we didn't spend a lifetime there—we worked hard, and we did the people's business.;I'm going to continue working this issue, State after State after State. I'm going to continue to call upon the United States Congress, members of both political parties, to stand up, to do what's right for a young generation of Americans coming up, to fix this Social Security system once and for all so a young generation of Americans will have that same sense of security that previous generations had when it came time for them to retire.;There's no doubt in my mind, we're going to get this job done. And if you're interested in the subject, pay attention. Call your elected Representatives. The voice of the people can determine what takes place in Washington, DC.;I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come by and visit with you. I want to thank the members of the FFA for being leaders, for making right choices, for setting high standards, for setting the example, and for serving the communities in which you live. May God bless you all, and may God continue to bless our country.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at the President's Dinner</td><td class="c6">June 14, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thank you all for coming. Thank you for the warm reception. Thank you all. Thanks for coming. It's nice to have dinner with a group of friends. I appreciate you all coming here. This is a very important dinner because, through your generosity, we're going to keep control of the Senate and the House, and America will be better off for it.;I really appreciate you being here. I am sorry that the First Lady is not here. She sends her love. Generally when I say that, people groan, and I take it to mean they wish she'd have come and not me. I understand that. I'll tell you something about Laura. She's quite the comedienne, quite the diplomat. She's a heck of a First Lady and a great wife and mom. I love her dearly.;I want to thank Senator Lamar Alexander for his leadership on this incredibly successful dinner. I appreciate Speaker Denny Hastert. He is one fine man. He's a great Speaker of the House. And through your generosity, he's going to stay Speaker of the House. I want to thank the majority leader of the United States Senate, Bill Frist. He too is a great leader, and I appreciate calling him friend.;I want to thank Senator Elizabeth Dole, who is the NRSC chairman, CongressmanTom Reynolds, the NRCC chairman. Those are initials for, like, let's raise money and get the Senate in Republican—keep the Senate in Republican hands and House in Republican hands. Thank you for supporting these causes.;I want to thank the Members of the Senate and Congress for working so hard. I want to thank the Members of the—all the Members of the Congress who've joined us tonight. I appreciate the members of my Cabinet who are here.;I want to pay special tribute to the Republican National Committee chairman, Ken Mehlman, for the fantastic job he's doing on reaching out to people from all walks of life. I want to thank the President's Dinner leadership, especially Ken Thompson and his wife, Kathylee, for the fantastic job you all have done and everybody up here has done. I want to thank the Duke Ellington School of the Arts Show Choir for being here today.;I'm proud to be the head of a party that has a positive and hopeful and optimistic vision for every single person who lives in this country. And I'm proud to be a head of a party that is driving the debate on all the key domestic and foreign policy issues. Because of our achievements, the American people see us as the party of reform and optimism and results, the party that is moving this Nation forward.;All of us in Washington have a duty to the people who sent us here. Political parties can take one of two approaches. One approach is to lead, to focus on the people's business, to take on the tough problems. And that is exactly what our party's done.;The other approach is to simply do nothing, to delay solutions, obstruct progress, refuse to take responsibility. Members of the other party have worked with us to achieve important reforms on some issues. Yet too often, their leadership prefers to block the ideas of others. We hear "no" to making tax relief permanent. We hear "no" to Social Security reform. We hear "no" to confirming Federal judges. We hear "no" to a highly qualified U.N. Ambassador. We hear "no" to medical liability reform. On issue after issue, they stand for nothing except obstruction, and this is not leadership. It is the philosophy of the stop sign, the agenda of the roadblock, and our country and our children deserve better.;Political parties that choose the path of obstruction will not gain the trust of the American people. If leaders of the other party have innovative ideas, let's hear them. But if they have no ideas or policies except obstruction, they should step aside and let others lead.;We're a party that's gotten things done. Because we acted to pass the largest tax relief in a generation, our economy is growing again. We've created more than 3.5 million new jobs during the last 2 years. More Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;To keep this economy growing and creating jobs, we need to make the tax relief permanent. We need to get rid of the death tax forever. And we can do something else about taxes. I've appointed a bipartisan panel to examine our incoherent, out-of-date Tax Code. When their recommendations are delivered, I'm looking forward to working with the United States Congress to give this Nation a Tax Code that is progrowth, easy to understand, and fair to all.;Our party is the party of economic growth, and our party is the party of spending restraint. I've submitted the first budget to actually cut nonsecurity discretionary spending since Ronald Reagan was the President. Now the Congress needs to act to hold nondiscretionary spending below last year's level. The budget we submitted adheres to an interesting principle. It says taxpayers' money should be spent wisely or not spent at all.;We need to have a fiscally responsible highway bill that modernizes our roads and bridges and improves safety and creates jobs. We're on our way to cutting this deficit in half in 5 years, and I want to thank the Members of Congress for holding the line and doing what's right for the American taxpayer.;In order to make sure this economy grows, we need an energy bill. Four years ago, I presented Congress with a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, renewable sources of energy like ethanol and biodiesel, that says we can use nuclear energy in a clean way, that recognizes the need to spend money on clean coal technology. It's an energy plan that will make us less dependent on foreign sources of energy. For the sake of national security and for the sake of economic security, Congress needs to get a bill to my desk before the August recess.;We're proudly the party of free and fair trade. During my administration and thanks to the good works of Congress, we've opened up markets for millions of consumers of U.S. products. And now we have an opportunity to continue to open up new markets with CAFTA, the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade act. Right now most of the goods coming from the Central American countries enter into our country duty-free. Yet our goods are not received in their countries duty-free. For the sake of free trade, for the sake of fair trade, for the sake of good jobs, for the sake of promoting young democracies in Central America, Congress must pass CAFTA.;Ours is the party of the entrepreneur and small business. Ours is the party of litigation reform. We're the party that continues to free our entrepreneurs from needless regulations and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits. I applaud the Speaker and the leader for getting bipartisan class-action reform and bankruptcy reform through the Congress. Now we need asbestos litigation reform. And to stop junk lawsuits that are running good doctors out of practice and running up the cost of medicine, we need Federal medical liability reform.;Ours is the party that challenges the soft bigotry of low expectations, that worked to stop the practice of just shuffling kids through school, grade after grade, without them being able to read and write. Ours is the party that set high standards, believes in local control of schools, and insists that every child learn to read and write, so no child is left behind in America.;We set a clear agenda to make health care more affordable and to give American families greater access to coverage and more control over their health decisions. In 2003, we strengthened Medicare by giving seniors more choices and adding a prescription drug benefit. We have kept our commitment to our Nation's seniors, and now we must move forward with more community health centers to help the poor, improved health information technology, expanded health savings accounts and association health plans, so that small businesses can pool risk and buy insurance at the same discount that big companies are able to do.;Ours is the party that set the goal to encourage ownership in America. We want more people owning their own business. I'm proud to report more people own a home than ever before in our Nation's history, and more minority families are owning a home today than ever before.;We need to expand ownership to our retirement system. Recently, I've been spending time talking about an important issue, and that's Social Security reform. And the reason I have is because I believe the job of the President is to confront problems and not pass them on to future Presidents and future generations. We've got a problem when it comes to Social Security. No, you don't have a problem if you're getting your check now or if you were born prior to 1950. You'll get your check. The problem is for a younger generation of Americans who are paying payroll taxes or getting ready to pay payroll taxes into a system that is going broke.;Let me give you the math right quick, let you know why I'm talking about it all across the country. There's a lot of us getting ready to retire. We're called baby boomers. As a matter of fact, my retirement age is 2008—[ laughter ]—quite convenient. There are about 73 million baby boomers getting ready to retire. There are 40 million people retired today, another 33 million will be retired when the baby boomers fully retire. And we're living longer, and we've been promised greater benefits by Congress. And the real problem is there's fewer people paying into the system. Today, there's 3.3 workers per beneficiary. Soon, there will be two workers per beneficiary. In 2017, the system goes into the red. In 2027, it's $200 billion short. In 2041, it's bankrupt.;It is not right to sit here in Washington, DC, knowing the system is going bankrupt for younger Americans and not do anything about it. So I'm going to keep talking about it and keep putting ideas out. I've laid out some plans that would nearly fix all of the Social Security problem.;I'll tell you another idea we need to do is we need to give workers the option that Congress has given itself, and that is to be able to take some of their own money, some of their own payroll taxes and set it aside in a personal savings account they call their own, a personal savings account that will let them earn a better rate of return on their money, a personal savings account they can leave to whomever they want, a personal savings account the Government cannot take away or spend on special programs.;Ours is the party that believes in ownership. We want to extend the so-called investor class to all walks of life. We believe everybody should have an asset they can call their own. And we have a fantastic opportunity to strengthen and save Social Security for a generation of Americans to come and to give more Americans the great pride of owning something they call their own. Congress needs to act on this issue. Strengthening Social Security requires honesty and courage, and the party I'm proud to lead will do our duty. Our children's retirement security is more important than partisan politics.;Our party will continue to support the faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. We'll continue to promote a culture of life in which every person is valued and every life has meaning. And we will defend the institution of marriage from being redefined forever by activist judges.;And speaking about judges, the American people made it clear they want judges who faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. I applaud Senator Frist and Senator Specter and Senator Hatch and other Members of the United States Senate in confirming some outstanding nominees who have waited a long time for a vote, Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown and Bill Pryor. I'll continue to urge the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility by giving every judicial nominee an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.;And speaking of confirmations, the Senate must promptly confirm John Bolton, my nominee to be our Ambassador to the United Nations, so we can get on with the business of reforming that institution.;My most solemn duty and the most solemn duty of those of us in Government here in Washington is to protect the American people. Our strategy is clear: We will be relentless, we will never tire in chasing down the terrorists, we will confront them abroad so we do not have to face them here at home.;We carried out the largest reorganization of Government in a half-century to form a single Department with a single mission, protecting America from attack. The tireless efforts of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal and State and local first-responders— protecting our Nation and making this country more secure. And as they do so, they need to have all the tools to be able to help defend this country. And that is why I call upon the United States Congress to renew all the provisions of the PATRIOT Act.;The PATRIOT Act is an important piece of legislation. It gives those folks who are on the frontline of fighting terror the same tools, many of the same tools that are used to track down drug kingpins or tax cheats. If those tools are good enough to track down drug kingpins, they ought to be good enough in this war on terror to give to our law enforcement so we can better defend this country.;And we're making progress. Since September the 11th, 2001, we've closed down terrorist networks. We brought to justice many of the key leaders of Al Qaida. We're disrupting their finances. There is no place they can hide from the United States of America and our allies and friends.;The best way to secure this country in the long run, though, is to spread democracy and freedom. We believe everybody deserves to be free. We believe everybody has a deep desire in their heart to live in a free society. We believe mothers all around the world want to raise their children in a free and peaceful world.;And the people of Afghanistan showed clearly the desire of those who have lived under tyranny to take the risks necessary to live in a free society. Think about how far that country has come in a brief period of time. We enforced doctrine that said, "If you harbor a terrorist, you're just as guilty as the terrorist." And by removing the Taliban, America and the free world are safer. But at the same time, we gave the Afghan people a chance to live in a free and democratic society. And for the first time in the history of that country, for the first time in thousands of years, millions of people went to the polls to vote. And the first voter was a 19-year-old girl in Afghanistan.;Freedom is on the march from the Ukraine to Afghanistan to the Palestinian Territory to Lebanon and to Iraq. By removing Saddam Hussein from power, America and the free world are safer. By removing Saddam Hussein from power, the people of Iraq have a chance to live in a free society. And the United States of America will stand squarely with that new democracy as it grows and flourishes and becomes a free society in the heart of the Middle East.;I know many of you here have got relatives and friends who are serving in the United States military. I can't tell you how proud I am to be the Commander in Chief of such a great group of folks. America is more secure, the world is more free, the foundations of peace are being laid because of the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the United States military.;The United States has a special obligation, in my view, to work with freedom fighters all around the world, to stand squarely with the reformers. I believe it's important for generations to come, because I understand that democracies don't fight each other, that democracies are the way to defeat hatred, that democracies provide the best hope for men and women around the world. There's no doubt in my mind the policies that this administration has taken will make the world more peaceful for generations to come.;The American people have entrusted us with the leadership of this great country at an historic moment. We've set big goals, and they're not always easy to achieve. Otherwise, they'd have been done already. But we're going to continue to be the party that sets the big goals, the party that's idealistic, the party of reform. We'll continue to lead, no matter how tough the challenge might be. You see, the American people have given us their trust. But the good news for the American people is, in our policies we trust them. We trust their values. We trust their judgment. We trust them with their own money. So long as we stay true to our values and our ideas, we will do what Americans have always done. We will build a better world for our children and our grandchildren.;It is such an honor to be the President of such a great nation. Thank you for coming tonight. May God bless your families, and may God continue to bless our country. Thank you all.</td></tr>

Bush: The President's Radio Address</td><td class="c6">June 18, 2005</td><td class="c7">Good morning. Today, we face two issues of vital importance for all Americans, growing our economy and protecting our citizens from those who wish to do us harm. So in the weeks ahead, I will continue to focus on ways to ensure that our Government takes the side of working families and that America prevails in the war on terror. As we take the steps necessary to achieve these goals, we will make our future one of peace and prosperity.;Today, we have good reason to be optimistic about our economy. More Americans are working today than at any time in our history. More Americans own their homes than at any time in our history. More Americans are going to college and own their own businesses than at any time in our history. And a new economic report shows that inflation is in check. Our policies have put us on the track to growth, but leaders in Washington must not become complacent. We need to work together to ensure that opportunity reaches every corner of our great country.;Delivering opportunity means allowing families to keep more of the money they earn. So we enacted the largest tax relief in a generation. That is only a beginning. You need a reformed Tax Code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand and rewards your hard work and entrepreneurial spirit. And Congress needs to do its part by making the tax relief we passed permanent and burying the death tax forever.;Delivering opportunity also means adapting to the needs of a new century. In this new century, American prosperity will increasingly depend on our ability to sell our goods and services overseas, so we need to pass initiatives like the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement to create a level playing field for American farmers and small businesses.;In this new century, Americans require a reliable and affordable supply of energy. I proposed a comprehensive energy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In this new century, Americans need to know that if they work hard their whole lives, they will retire with dignity, so we're working to save Social Security to ensure that the next generation of retirees will be as secure in their retirement as today's generation.;As we work to deliver opportunity at home, we're also keeping you safe from threats from abroad. We went to war because we were attacked, and we are at war today because there are still people out there who want to harm our country and hurt our citizens. Some may disagree with my decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power, but all of us can agree that the world's terrorists have now made Iraq a central front in the war on terror. These foreign terrorists violently oppose the rise of a free and democratic Iraq, because they know that when we replace despair and hatred with liberty and hope, they lose their recruiting grounds for terror.;Our troops are fighting these terrorists in Iraq so you will not have to face them here at home. We mourn every one of these brave men and women who have given his or her life for our liberty. The terrorists know they cannot defeat our troops, so they seek to weaken our Nation's resolve. They know there is no room for them in a free and democratic Middle East, so the terrorists and insurgents are trying to get us to retreat. Their goal is to get us to leave before Iraqis have had a chance to show the region what a Government that is elected and truly accountable to its citizens can do for its people.;Time and again, the Iraqi people have defied the skeptics who claim they are not up to the job of building a free society. Nearly a year ago, Iraqis showed they were ready to resume sovereignty. A few months ago, Iraqis showed they could hold free elections. This week, Iraqis have worked on an agreement to expand their constitutional drafting committee to ensure that all communities are represented in the process. I am confident that Iraqis will continue to defy the skeptics if they build a new Iraq that represents the diversity of their nation and assumes greater responsibility for their own security. And when they do, our troops can come home with the honor they have earned.;This mission isn't easy, and it will not be accomplished overnight. We're fighting a ruthless enemy that relishes the killing of innocent men, women, and children. By making their stand in Iraq, the terrorists have made Iraq a vital test for the future security of our country and the free world. We will settle for nothing less than victory.;I'll continue to act to keep our people safe from harm and our future bright. Together we will do what Americans have always done, build a better and more peaceful world for our children and grandchildren.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Swearing-In Ceremony for Ben S. Bernanke as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers</td><td class="c6">June 21, 2005</td><td class="c7">The President. Good morning. Thank you all for coming. I'm pleased to congratulate a distinguished economist and public servant, Ben Bernanke, on becoming the new Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Congratulations. I'm also honored to have Ben's wife, Anna, and his two children, Alyssa and Joel, with us, thank you all for coming.;Ben has taught advanced economics at some of our Nation's top universities for over two decades. And for nearly 3 years, he has done an outstanding job as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He's a talented, visionary thinker. I'll look forward to his advice. I'll look forward to his counsel. And there's no doubt in my mind he will be an outstanding Chairman of the CEA.;Ben follows three others who have done a superb job as Chairmen of my Council of Economic Advisers: Harvey Rosen— there he is—[ laughter ]—Greg Mankiw, and Glenn Hubbard. I'm grateful to have had such able and dedicated counselors. I thank them for their service.;I appreciate the Director of the OMB and member of my Cabinet who has joined us today, Josh Bolten. I want to thank my friend Al Hubbard, the Director of the National Economic Council, with whom Ben will be working closely.;I'm most grateful, and I know Ben is as well—is that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Alan Greenspan, has joined us today—welcome—as well as Roger Ferguson, the Vice Chairman of the Fed. I appreciate you all coming.;I want to thank Ned Gramlich, a Governor of the Federal Reserve, Susan Bies, a Governor of the Federal Reserve. I want to thank the staff of the Council of Economic Advisers who have joined us today. You're fixing to work for a good man.;Ben will lead the CEA at an important time for our economy. Today, Americans have many reasons to be optimistic about our economic future. After all, our economy is growing faster than that of any other major industrialized nation. Over the last 2 years, we've added more than 3.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is down to 5.1 percent. That is lower than the average rate of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. More Americans are working today than ever before. Small businesses are flourishing. Families are taking home more of what they earn, and more people own their homes than ever before.;We've got to build on those achievements to make sure we have lasting prosperity in America. I look forward to Ben's advice as we continue to advance a progrowth, projobs agenda. By making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we'll keep America the economic leader of the world.;Our agenda for a stronger economy begins with allowing families to keep more of the money they earn. To get the economy growing again after the September the 11th attacks, we enacted the largest tax relief in a generation. In order to make sure that that tax relief continues to work on behalf of entrepreneurs and small businesses and families, Congress needs to make that tax relief permanent. We also need a reformed Tax Code that is simple and fair and easy to understand. I'm looking forward to Ben's advice on the definition of a good, reformed Tax Code.;To keep America the economic leader of the world, we must recognize that the money we spend belongs to the taxpayers, not to the Government. We'll insist on a budget that tames the spending appetite of the Federal Government and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.;To keep America the economic leader of the world, we must free our small businesses from needless regulations and protect honest job creators from junk lawsuits. Congress needs to pass the asbestos liability bill—now. And this year we also need to pass medical liability. To keep health care more affordable and accessible, we've got to work to pass association health plans and continue to expand health savings accounts. To ensure America's future prosperity, we'll continue to insist upon high results and measuring achievements so that every child can learn to read and write and add and subtract.;To keep America the economic leader of the world, we will strengthen the institutions that underpin our society. Americans need to know that if they work hard their whole lives, they'll be able to retire with confidence and peace of mind, so we're working to save Social Security for a younger generation of workers. We want to make sure the next generation of retirees will be as secure in their retirement as today's retirees.;Americans will require a reliable and affordable energy supply if we want to be the leader of the world, and so that's why I proposed a comprehensive energy policy 4 years ago to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil. Now is the time for the United States Congress to get an energy bill on my desk that will allow us to diversify away from the hydrocarbon society in which we live.;In this new century, American prosperity will increasingly depend on our ability to sell our goods and services overseas. We need to pass CAFTA, the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, to show the world our commitment to free and fair trade and to stand squarely with those young democracies in our own hemisphere.;A vibrant economy requires a strong and confident economic leadership, and I am happy to have Ben's experience. I want to thank Ben for agreeing to serve at an important time for our economy, and I look forward to his wise counsel. Congratulations.;[ At this point, Chairman Bernanke made brief remarks. ];The President. Hold off on a happy birthday for a minute. [ Laughter ];[ Chairman Bernanke made further remarks. ];The President. Good job, Ben. Thanks for coming.</td></tr>

Thanks for letting me interrupt your workday. [ Laughter ] I hope it's okay. [ Laughter ] I really appreciate you having me. It's a good—I like to get out of Washington, and I like to pay a visit to our neighbors outside the Beltway. So I appreciate you letting me come by.;Thanks for the tour of this important facility. I want to thank those back at the control room for being so gracious and kind and taking time to explain all the dials and gauges. [ Laughter ] I can play like I understand what I saw. [ Laughter ];But one thing is for certain, that when the people of Maryland flip a switch and see their lights come on, they need to thank the people working here at this plant. This plant is providing a lot of important power for people all over the State of Maryland. I've come to talk about economic security. I've come to talk about the need to get a good energy policy out of the Congress. And there's no better place to do it than right here in Calvert Cliffs. Thanks for letting me come.;Laura didn't come with me. She's out west with our daughter Jenna in the Grand Canyon. How about that? [ Laughter ] She's doing a great job as the First Lady. She is a fabulous wife and a great mom, and she sends her best to all the good folks who work here at Calvert Cliffs.;I appreciate the Secretary of Energy joining me today. He's a good man. He knows a lot about the subject, you'll be pleased to hear. I was teasing him—he taught at MIT and—do you have a Ph.D.?;Secretary of Energy Samuel W. Bodman.;Yes.;The President. Yes, Ph.D. [ Laughter ] Now I want you to pay careful attention to this. He's the Ph.D., and I'm the C student, but notice who is the adviser and who is the President. [ Laughter ] He's a good man, and I really appreciate working with Sam to achieve a great national goal, which is become less dependent on foreign sources of energy.;I appreciate Nils Diaz, who is the Chairman of the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thanks for coming. I want to thank Governor Bob Ehrlich from the great State of Maryland. I appreciate you coming, Governor. Thanks for being here. He's a pro-jobs, pro-growth, pro-small-business Governor. And I enjoy working with him to help create an environment that helps people realize their dreams.;I want to thank George Vanderheyden, who is the site vice president of the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. He represents—at least on the tour—represented a lot of the good folks who work here. I want to say something about the folks who work here. I want to thank you for your hard work, and I want to thank you for your patriotism and your love of your country. I understand that six of your fellow employees are now in Iraq. And for the families and the coworkers here, I say: Thank you, on behalf of a grateful nation, for supporting these good folks. These folks are there defeating terrorists who cannot stand the thought of democracy and freedom, defeating them there so we do not have to face them here at home. These folks are there spreading democracy and freedom, understanding that a democratic world is more likely to leave a foundation for peace for our children. So I want to thank you for your sacrifices and thank you for supporting those good folks.;I want to thank the president and the CEO of Constellation Energy, Mayo Shattuck. That's a pretty cool first name, isn't it, Mayo. [ Laughter ] Pass the Mayo. [ Laughter ] His wife, Molly, appreciated that. [ Laughter ] I want to thank Mike Wallace, Skip Bowman. Thank you all. Thanks for letting me come by.;As you know, I'm an optimistic person, and I hope you are as well. These are incredibly hopeful times for our country, and the state of our economy is strong. And Americans from all walks of life have got good reason to be confident about the future of this country. Let me just give you some of the facts. Over the past year, America's economy has grown faster than any major industrialized economy in the world. In other words, we're leading growth when it comes to major industrialized economies.;Over the past 2 years, America has added more than 3.5 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is down to 5.1 percent. That's lower than the average rate in the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. In Maryland, the unemployment is 4.2 percent. People are working. I'm proud to report that more Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;Our economy is sustaining low inflation rates, low interest rates, and low mortgage rates. Small businesses are flourishing. Families are taking home more of what they earn. Your after-tax incomes are up. More Americans are going to college than at any other time in our Nation's history. More Americans own their own businesses than ever before. And homeownership in America is at an alltime high. This strong and growing economy is lifting our standard of living, and that's important because that means opportunity is being spread throughout the country.;Now listen, I understand parts of our country are still struggling from the effects of the recession and the attacks. I know some workers are concerned about jobs going overseas. I know some are concerned about gaining the skills necessary to compete in the global market that we live in. I know that families are worried about health care and retirement. And I know moms and dads are worried about their children finding good jobs.;See, even though the numbers are still good, there are still worries out there in the country. And these are the challenges of a rapidly changing economy. And we've got the responsibility in Government to take the side of our working families. So we're moving aggressively. We're not taking the good numbers for granted. We're moving aggressively with a pro-growth, pro-worker set of economic policies that'll enhance economic security in the country.;Economic security happens for our workers and families when we keep your taxes low. It happens when we open up new markets for American products. It happens when we stop the spread of junk lawsuits. We're going to create economic security for moms and dads by making health care more affordable, by guaranteeing a quality education for every child, and ensuring dignity in retirement. And that's what I've come to talk to you about today.;The United States Congress has now an opportunity to create more economic security by passing an energy bill that will make energy more affordable and reliable for generations to come. Energy is vital to the future of this country. Everybody who works here knows that. Everybody who turns on their light switch should know that. It's obvious that we can't expand our economy if businesses don't have energy. You've got to have energy if you're going to be a farmer. You got to have energy if you're just trying to raise a family. If you're a baseball fan, you need energy. I mean, try going to a night ball game— [ laughter ]—without any lights. How about the Nats and the Orioles, by the way, speaking about baseball?;Our Nation needs to confront a basic problem. We're using energy faster than we're producing it. And the problem has been building for a long period of time, because we really haven't confronted this problem. That's why I submitted this strategy to Congress when we first got up to Washington. Over the past decade, America's energy consumption has been growing about 40 times faster than our energy production. Think about that. Four years ago, I said to Congress, "Let's deal with this problem now.;The problem is, there's been a lot of debate and a lot of politics but no results. So now is the time, for the sake of our consumers and business folks and people who are trying to heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer and find reasonable gas prices at the—gasoline prices at the pump. It's time for Congress to stop the debate, stop the inaction, and pass an energy bill.;And I appreciate Chairman Barton in the House, that moved a good—where he'd been able to move a good bill to the floor, and it got voted on. I appreciate Senator Domenici of New Mexico for moving a bill out of committee. It's on the Senate floor. They need to get it passed out of the Senate. They need to reconcile their differences. They need to get me a bill before they go home in August. And I'm looking forward to signing that bill, and it's going to be an important part of developing a national energy strategy.;Look, I recognize and I hope you recognize that when I sign that bill, your gasoline prices aren't going to drop. This problem has been long in the making. But by addressing it now, we're going to be able to say, "Life's going to be better for our children and grandchildren.;To make this country less dependent on foreign sources of oil, we need to do the following things: One, we need to encourage our citizens to be better conservers of energy, and technology will help a lot. There's some incentives in the bill to encourage conservation.;We need to make more efficient use of existing energy sources like oil, coal, and natural gas. We've got a lot of coal in this country, about 250 years' worth of coal. I'm convinced that with proper use of technology, that we will be able to develop coal-fired electricity plants that have got zero emissions. We're spending a fair amount of your money to make sure that we can achieve that objective. I think it's a good use of your money. It's a way to help make sure we use an abundant resource that we have here in America without polluting the air.;We need to diversify our energy supply by increasing the use of alternative and renewable sources like ethanol, which is made from corn, or biodiesel made from soybeans. I went to a soybean refinery the other day in Virginia where they're making diesel fuel from soybeans. With the right, proper use of your dollars to encourage research, it's very conceivable that source of energy will become economic. And that makes sense, doesn't it? Can you imagine walking down the road here in the farmlands of Maryland, see a guy growing soybeans, you say, "Thanks, buddy, for making us less dependent on foreign sources of oil.;So there's some smart things that this energy bill will encourage the country to do, including solar power and hydrogen. I don't know if you remember I laid out, I thought—I know—an interesting initiative. It said, "Why don't we explore how we use hydrogen power—hydrogen to power our cars, to help us diversify away from dependency upon hydrocarbons." And I believe we can develop a hydrogen-power automobile over the next decade or two. I think it will be cool if your young son is able to take a driver's test in a hydrogen-powered automobile that has got zero emissions and, at the same time, will make us less dependent on hydrocarbons which we have to import from foreign countries.;We need to modernize the electricity grid and make reliability standards mandatory. We also need to make—get rid of some of these laws that prohibit the capacity for those people who are building transmission lines and powering our cities and States to be able to raise money in an effective way.;We need to help large energy users like India and China become more efficient. And by helping them develop efficiency standards, it'll take pressure off of global demand for hydrocarbons. One of the reasons why your price of gasoline is going up is, one, we're dependent on foreign sources of oil, and two, economies like China and India are demanding more oil in a limited supply—in a market that's of limited supply, which causes the price of oil to go up, which causes the price of gasoline to go up. So it makes sense to help those who are demanding more energy to be more efficient users of energy.;And I'll take that message to the G-8 in Scotland here, right after the Fourth of July celebrations, to say, "Look, let's work together on a comprehensive energy plan to help these new consumers of energy be better users of energy.;The energy bill will also help us expand our use of the one energy source that is completely domestic, plentiful in quantity, environmentally friendly, and able to generate massive amounts of electricity—and that's nuclear power.;Today, there are 103 nuclear plants in America. They produce about 20 percent of the Nation's electricity without producing a single pound of air pollution or greenhouse gases. I think you told me that 20 percent of all Maryland's electricity is produced here at this plant. Without these nuclear plants, America would release nearly 700 million metric tons more carbon dioxide into the air each year. That's about the same amount of carbon dioxide that now comes from all our cars and trucks.;Across this State, Maryland has looked to Calvert Cliffs to keep their lights on and to keep their land, air, and water clean. In other words, you're generating electricity and helping the environment at the same time. That's an important combination of talents, and it's an important combination of—that the American people have got to understand is possible when we expand nuclear power.;Nuclear power is one of America's safest sources of energy. People out here practice a lot of safety, they're good at it. You've got nuclear engineers and experts that spend a lot of time maintaining a safe environment. Just ask the people that work here. You wouldn't be coming here if it wasn't safe, I suspect. [ Laughter ];Some Americans remember the problems of the nuclear plants—that the nuclear plants had back in the 1970s. We all remember those days. That frightened a lot of folks. People have got to understand that advances in sciences and engineering and plant design have made nuclear plants far safer—far safer than ever before. Workers and managers are trained and committed and spend hours working on nuclear safety, and that's good. And they do such a good job here at Calvert Cliffs that this was the first nuclear plant in America to gets its operating license renewed, and I congratulate you.;There is a growing consensus that more nuclear power will lead to a cleaner, safer nation. Slowly but surely, people are beginning to look at the facts. One of the reasons I've come to this plant is to help people understand the difference between fact and fiction. Yet, even though there has been a growing consensus over time, America has not ordered a nuclear plant since the 1970s. By contrast, France has built 58 nuclear plants in the same period of time. By contrast, China now has 8 nuclear plants in the works and plans to build at least 40 more over the next two decades.;In the 21st century, our Nation will need more electricity—more safe, clean, reliable electricity. It is time for this country to start building nuclear powerplants again.;We're taking practical steps to encourage new construction of powerplants. Three years ago, we launched the Nuclear Power 2010 Initiative, which is a $1.1 billion partnership between Government and industry to coordinate the ordering of new plants. The Department of Energy is working with Congress to reduce uncertainty in the nuclear plant licensing process. Look, you don't want to go out and build a plant, spend all the money, and have the license jerked at the last minute. [ Laughter ] Nobody's going to spend money if that's the case.;And so we want to have a rational way to move forward, and one rational way to move forward is to provide incentives for new construction such as Federal risk insurance, to help the builders of the first four plants—that's what's now embedded in the energy bill—first four plants against lawsuits and bureaucratic obstacles and other delays beyond their control.;In other words, there's a rational approach for the Federal Government: On the one hand, to convince the American people nuclear power is safe, that it makes sense for our consumers, it makes sense for the long-term economic security of our country to expand nuclear power, and on the other hand, say to those who are risking capital, "Here's some help. Here's some ways we can provide incentive for you to move forward with the construction of plants.;Delivering a good energy bill is part of a comprehensive agenda, but there's some other things we need to do. One of the last things that we need to do to this economy is to take money out of your pocket and fuel Government. I firmly believe that one of the reasons we recovered the way we did after the recession and September the 11th is because of the tax cuts we passed. I believe that if you've got more money in your pocket, you can spend it wiser than the Federal Government can spend it. And therefore, I think Congress ought to send a strong signal to families and small businesses and risktakers about taxes, and that is: We're going to keep your taxes low. They need to make the tax relief we passed permanent.;Secondly, we need to do something about the Tax Code itself. It's complicated. It's really thick. It makes—it does not reward entrepreneurship. It's unfair. So I called some Republicans and Democrats who care about this issue together. I said, "Come up with a plan to simplify the Tax Code so people can understand it and so it helps achieve some objectives, which is fairness, simplicity, easy to understand." I mean, you shouldn't have to—have to hire all kinds of folks to figure out what's in the Tax Code. And so once we get those recommendations, I look forward to working with Congress to not only keep your taxes low but to make the code simple and easy to understand.;Families understand you've got to live within a budget. That's something that Congress needs to understand as well. So I submitted the most disciplined proposal for nonsecurity discretionary spending since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. I say "nonsecurity", my attitude is, when we got anybody in harm's way, we're going to spend whatever it takes to make sure they've got the very best equipment and training so they can do their mission. We owe that to the families, and we owe that to their loved ones.;But I'm talking about nonsecurity discretionary spending. And it's important for Congress to adhere to the budgets they passed. And by doing so, we will reduce the deficit in half by 2009. In other words, we can meet priorities. We can keep your taxes low. And if Congress is fiscally wise and sound with your money, we can reduce that deficit in half by 2009. I'm looking forward to working with them to be wise about how we spend your money. Sometimes it's interesting in Washington, you hear, "Well, we're spending the Government's money." That's—when you hear somebody say "the Government's money," get a little nervous, because they have seemed—they seem to have forgotten where that money comes from. See, it's not the Government's money. It's your money that we're spending in Washington, and we've got to be wise about we spend it in order to keep this economy growing.;Another threat to economic security is junk lawsuits. Frivolous lawsuits help drive up the total costs of America's tort system to more than $240 billion a year. That's a burden far greater than any other major industrialized nation, by the way. In order to remain competitive, in order to keep jobs here in America, in order to make sure that people can make a decent living, we've got to do something about these junk lawsuits.;It's one thing to have a legal system where people can—who have got a legitimate claim can go take care of it. It's the junk lawsuits that run up the cost of doing business, junk lawsuits that make it a— America less competitive. These junk lawsuits cost people jobs, and they raise your prices. And so I've been working with Congress and call upon Congress, if we're interested in economic security for the future, let's do something about frivolous lawsuits.;And we're making progress. We got a good bill to curb abuse of class-action lawsuits. There's more to do. I think we need to get something done on the asbestos issue, have a fair bill that says, "We're going to treat the workers who've been harmed well." They deserve to be treated. They deserve to be focused on—not the trial lawyers. And at the same time, provide certainty in the system. Legal reform is a necessary part of keeping this economy going.;And so, by the way, is opening up new markets for America's producers and farmers. We got a chance to break down some trade barriers. I told the people when I was campaigning, I said, "Look, I'm for free trade. I'm also for fair trade. I just want to be treated fairly. If we treat you one way, you treat us the same way.;There's a debate raging in Congress now about the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. It's called CAFTA. Let me tell you the facts about this trade agreement. I don't know if you realize this, but now 80 percent of the goods from Central America come into our country duty-free. Yet we're not treated the same way down there. Now, that doesn't make sense to me. It seems like to me that it would make sense if we say, "Okay, your goods are already coming in here, treat us the same way. Just level the playing field. You've got 44 million consumers. Open up your markets to our goods just like we've done to you." That's what CAFTA is all about.;See, I have a different approach than some of the economic isolationists who oppose this agreement. I believe they're pessimistic about America. I believe American workers can compete with anybody, anywhere, anytime, if the rules are fair. And so they need to pass CAFTA to be fair to our farmers and ranchers and workers and small-business owners.;Millions of Americans lack economic security because of the rising cost of health care. Did you know this, that more than half of the uninsured work for small businesses? Isn't that interesting? One way to address health care is to say, "Small businesses ought to be allowed to pool risk so they can buy insurance at the same discount that big companies are able to do." Congress needs to pass what's called association health plans to let small businesses be able to enter the market in a way that is—they're able to spread risk across a lot of employees.;We need to offer incentives for small businesses and low-income workers to open tax-free health savings accounts. If you're running a small business, look into what's called HSAs, health savings accounts. They're really interesting products that'll let your worker manage his or her own money and, at the same time, make health care more affordable for the small business— or large business for that matter. HSAs are an interesting, innovative way for people to get good health care insurance that puts you in charge of the decisionmaking process, that lets you make the decisions and, at the same time, save money for your health care concerns tax-free.;We need to encourage a national marketplace for health insurance. In other words, workers ought to be allowed to go on the Internet and purchase health care across State lines. We've got to create more demand within the health care place. Right now, for example, if you live in Maryland, you only can buy health insurance out of Maryland, the health insurance that is certified out of Maryland. I think you ought to be allowed to go on the Internet, and if you can find a better product for you in Colorado, you ought to be allowed to do that. In other words, we ought to have a consumer-friendly system, where people are encouraged to go out and make choices that meet their needs.;We need to expand health information technology. If you've really looked at your own industry here or industries across America, they're using information technology to modernize and become more efficient. Health care hasn't done that yet. If you look at your file, your medical file, they're generally handwritten. And knowing how doctors write, it's hard to read what they've written. [ Laughter ] But it's an inefficient system. And so to bring health care into the 21st century, we're working on an information technology initiative.;To reduce the cost of medicine for every doctor, every patient, and every business, it's time for Congress to pass medical liability reform. One of the biggest problems we got here in America is junk lawsuits running good doctors out of practice. We've got ob-gyns leaving the practice of medicine all across this country because they can't afford to stay in business. And that's not right.;When I first came to Washington, I said, "Well, maybe medical liability reform was a State issue." I was the Governor of a State, so I was kind of—felt like we could do a better job in our respective States of dealing with medical liability until I looked at the cost of what these junk lawsuits were doing to your Federal budget.;See, if you think you're going to get sued, oftentimes you practice more medicine than necessary. It's called the defensive practice of medicine. Ask your local doctor, and he'll tell you what I mean by that. If you are getting sued a lot, your premiums go up. And in that the Federal Government pays a lot of health care costs through Medicaid, Medicare, veterans health benefits, we're spending a lot of money at the Federal level as a result of these lawsuits.;And so I decided that this was a national problem that required a national solution. And for the sake of affordable and available health care, Congress needs to pass medical liability reform. And I urge them—I urge them as Members of the United States Senate, where the bill is stuck, not to listen to the trial lawyers but listen to the patients and doctors all across America.;To make sure that we have economic security for generations to come, we've got to make sure we have quality education for every child. You can't compete unless your children can read and write and add and subtract. The No Child Left Behind Act we passed is challenging what I've called the soft bigotry of low expectations. That means you have your expectations so low, you just move the children through the system without measuring whether or not they can read and write. In other words, if you don't think certain children can read and write, the easy path is just move them through. I have a—I had a different view when I came to Washington. I said, "I believe every child can read and write, and I expect every child to read and write, and in return for Federal money, we want schools to show us whether or not children are learning to read and write." That's how you achieve results: You measure.;And so we've asked schools, we said, "Look, we're giving you a lot of money out of the Federal level, so in return for that money, just show us. That's all you got to do. Show us whether the curriculum you're using is working. Show us whether or not children are learning to read and write.;And it's working here in Maryland. You're doing a good job, Governor, so are your education people, the teachers all across this State. And here's why I can say that: Since the No Child Left Behind Act took effect, reading and math scores have increased in all 24 of Maryland's public school systems. How do you know? Because we measure. We're not guessing. We used to guess. Now we measure, so we know.;In 2003, 39 percent of Hispanic third graders in Maryland met the standards in reading—39 percent. We have an achievement gap in America. Two years later, more than 63 percent are meeting the standards. In other words, when you measure, you can determine whether or not what you're using in the classroom is working. And if not, it gives you reason to change.;The gap—in that the gap is closing all across the country is really good news for the future. We've got to make sure every child from every background, every part of America gains the basic skills necessary to become employable in the 21st century, which means I think we need to expand the high standards and accountability of No Child Left Behind to our public high schools so that the high school diploma means something. When you graduate, it means you can—means you're employable, or it means you can go to a community college, or it means you go to higher education. That's what we ought to be doing. This country ought to maintain high standards and strong accountability to make sure we have economic security in the future.;And finally, Americans need to know that if they work hard all their lives, they can retire with dignity. You might have heard, I've decided to address the Social Security issue. [ Laughter ] Let me tell you why I've addressed the issue. One, we have a problem, and secondly, I believe that the job description of a President ought to be— this person ought to confront problems, not pass them on to future Presidents and future generations. I believe that's my job.;If you're getting a check or you've got a mother or a grandmother getting a check, tell them that person has no problem when it comes to Social Security. You're going to get your check. I don't care what the politicians say or what the rhetoric—how heated the rhetoric becomes. Seems like every time I've run for office, they say, "If he gets in, he's going to take away your check." Well, people are still getting their checks, and I got in. [ Laughter ];But here's the problem—here is the problem: About 73 million of us are getting ready to retire. I'm kind of looking around trying to figure out who the baby boomers are. [ Laughter ] Generally, people without hair or gray hair. [ Laughter ] My retirement date, for example, my age when I'm eligible for retirement benefits happens to fall on 2008, which is a convenient year for me to be—[ laughter ]—be in a position to retire.;But a lot of us are getting ready to retire. As a matter of fact, I told you 73 million baby boomers are getting ready to retire. That contrasts with the 40 million folks who have retired today. So you got a lot more of us getting ready to enter the system. And we're going to live longer. And interestingly enough—I'm sure you're aware of this—but Congress over the past years has said, "Vote for me. I'm going to promise you better benefits." And so my generation, our generation, is going to get greater benefits than the previous generation. You've got a lot of people living longer, being promised greater benefits, with fewer people paying in the system. In 1950, there was about 16 workers to one paying into the system. Today, there's 3.3 workers to one. Soon there will be two workers to one. You've got a lot of youngsters coming up carrying a hefty burden for old guys like me.;And what that means is, is in 2017— which I guess seems like a long time to people in Washington, DC. If you've got a 2-year horizon, 2017 seems like ages. But 2017 is right around the corner. It's 12 years from now. If you've got a child 4 years old and you can get your driver's license at 16, they'll be driving before you know it. By the way, it's a little nerve-racking. [ Laughter ];And so I think it's time to act, and if we don't, we're going to start running some serious cash deficits, because in 2017, the system goes in the red, 2027, it's about 200 billion a year in the red, 2030, it's about 300 billion a year in the red. I know this is a tough issue for some of them in Washington. And the tendency is, "Let's just don't worry about it. Mr. President, why did you bring it up? Let's just pass it on.;The reason I brought it up is I cannot travel our country looking at young workers who are paying payroll taxes into a system that I know is going broke. And so now is the time to come together, both Republicans and Democrats, forget all that party business, and come together and solve this problem permanently, forever.;And I put some ideas on the table. And I expect people from both parties to put ideas on the table, and so do the American people. They're tired of this partisan bickering. When they see a problem, they want the American people to come and solve it. They tell me, "Well, you're not making much progress on Social Security." Well, I'll tell you one thing I am making progress on: The overwhelming number of Americans understand we have a problem. And I suspect the overwhelming number of Americans say, "If there's a problem in Washington, how come you're not doing anything about it?;And I'm going to continue talking about this issue. And I put a plan out there that says you can't retire—if you've worked all your life, a hard-working person, you shouldn't retire in poverty. And it's a plan, by the way, that says benefits will grow at the rate of wage increases for lower income Americans and the rate of inflation for the top 1 percent. And that solves about—a significant portion of the problem.;And I also believe something else. I believe younger workers ought to be able to take some of their own money, if that's what they choose, and set it aside in a personal savings account. In other words, you're paying payroll taxes in a system that's going broke. By the way, they call it pay-as-you-go. A lot of people in Washington—in the country probably think the payroll—the Social Security system is, "I'm paying my payroll taxes, and the Government's holding my money for me and giving it back to me when I retire." I hate to tell you, that's not the way it works, and it hasn't worked that way for a long time. We take your money, and we pay out to the retirees, and if we have money left over, like we have now, we're spending it on Government programs. And all that's left is a file cabinet full of IOUs in West Virginia, and I went and saw the file. You'll be happy to hear the paper's there—[ laughter ]—but not your money. In other words, all you're left with is an IOU.;What I think you ought to be left with, if you so choose, is some assets. And so I believe younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money, if they want to, as a part of a Social Security system, and set it up in a conservative mix of bonds and stocks or only bonds or whatever you choose to use. It's kind of like a 401(k). I suspect you've got a 401(k) plan here.;I went to an automobile plant in Mississippi. I said, "Anybody here have a— manage their own money as part of their retirement?" These were line workers. These weren't the office workers. There were the people out there making the automobiles, people from all walks of life, all income levels, all education levels. And I'll bet you 90 percent of the folks raised their hands. In other words, they say, "We're used to that, Mr. President. We're managing our own money. We're opening up our statement on a regular basis, watching our money grow.;Right now, if you—your money in Social Security is growing at about 1.8 percent. That doesn't seem like a very good deal to me. We ought to—if you so choose, we ought to let you earn a reasonable rate of money—a reasonable rate of return on your own money. And that money grows over time, and it compounds. And if you're a young worker at age 20 and you start setting aside some of your own payroll taxes in a reasonable rate of return, you're going to watch that money grow. And it's your asset, and the Government can't spend it on what they want, and they can't take it away, and you can pass it on to whomever you choose.;And let me tell you something about personal accounts. It was such an attractive idea that the United States Congress said as part of their retirement plan, they're going to let Members of the United States Senate or House of Representatives take some of their own money and set it aside in a personal account. And my attitude is this: If personal—voluntary personal savings accounts are good enough for the Members of the United States Congress, they're good enough for workers all across America.;And so here's a way forward, a way to encourage economic security and smart ways to make sure this economy continues to grow so people can realize dreams. That's really what Government ought to do. It ought to create that environment in which people are able to realize dreams and own a home and own your own business, own and manage your own retirement account. I love the idea of an ownership society. The more people own something in America, the better off America is, as far as I'm concerned. The more people own—the more assets people own, the more independent Americans are. They feel confident about the future. And I'm confident about our future. I don't think there's any problem we can't solve when we put our minds to it.;Things are going fine right now. But my job is to keep looking down the road. My job is to figure out how to keep this economy growing. My job is to get Congress to do—make wise policy so the entrepreneurial spirit is strong, so people can realize dreams, so this country remains the great beacon of hope that it has been in the past.;I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by and visit with you. May God bless you and your families, and may God continue to bless our country.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks on the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement</td><td class="c6">June 23, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thank you all for coming. Please be seated. I want to thank the Democratic and Republican leaders who have come here today to support the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement known as CAFTA. As you can see, there are former Cabinet members of both Republican and Democrat Presidents, former staff members of Republican and Democrat Presidents, people who have said it is time to set aside political differences and focus on this very important trade agreement for the good of our country. And I want to thank you all for coming. I appreciate our visit. I appreciate the chance to hear your point of view about what we need to do together to get this bill passed.;I want to thank the members of my Cabinet who are here. I appreciate you all coming. I particularly want to say thanks to Ambassador Rob Portman, who is the U.S. Trade Representative. He is the point person in the Bush administration to get this bill passed. He's working hard. He's working smart, and with your help and the help of those on the stage, I'm confident that Congress will do the right thing.;The reason we're here is because we share an interest in promoting opportunity and prosperity here at home. All of us understand that strengthening our economic ties with our democratic neighbors is a vital issue of national importance. All of us urge Congress to pass the agreement because America has an interest in strengthening democracy and advancing prosperity in our hemisphere.;One of the surest ways to strengthen democracy and advance prosperity is by establish a trading system based on clear rules. My predecessors from both parties, former Presidents from both political parties, pursued this goal at all levels—at the global level, at the bilateral level, and at the regional level. Today, CAFTA presents us with an historic opportunity to advance a free and fair trading system that will bring benefits to all sides.;I want to thank the members of the diplomatic corps from Central America who have joined us today. Los Embajadores, bienvenidos. Thank you for coming.;These Ambassadors understand what I just said. I said, this trade agreement benefits both sides. It's a good deal for the CAFTA countries, and it's a good deal for America as well.;It's a good deal for America because CAFTA will help level the playing field for our goods and services. Under existing rules, nearly 80 percent of imports from Central America and the Dominican Republic already enter the United States duty free. But U.S. exports into the region face heavy tariffs. Let me repeat that: 80 percent of goods produced in Central America come into our country, come into the United States duty-free. Yet the same isn't—it's not the same for American products.;By passing CAFTA, the United States would open up a market of 44 million consumers for our farmers and small-business people and entrepreneurs. By lowering barriers in key segments like textiles, CAFTA will put our region in a better position to compete with low-cost producers in Asia.;For the young democracies of Central America and the Dominican Republic, CAFTA would continue the current trade benefits. That means good jobs and higher labor standards for their workers. And because of reduced tariffs on U.S. goods, consumers in these countries would have access to better goods at lower prices. And that brings us a step closer to our goal of an Americas where the opportunities in San Jose, Costa Rica, are as real as they are in San Jose, California.;People have got to understand that by promoting policy that will help generate wealth in Central America, we're promoting policy that will mean someone is less— more likely to stay at home to find a job. If you're concerned about immigration to this country, then you must understand that CAFTA and the benefits of CAFTA will help create new opportunity in Central American countries, which will mean someone will be able to find good work at home, somebody will be able to provide for their family at home, as opposed to having to make the long trip to the United States. CAFTA is good immigration policy as well as good trade policy.;And it's good geopolitics as well. For the Western Hemisphere, CAFTA would bring the stability and security that can only come from freedom. That's what we're interested in. We're interested in spreading freedom. Today, a part of the world that was once characterized by oppression and military dictatorship sees its future in democratic elections and free and fair trade, and we cannot take these gains for granted. These small nations are making big and brave commitments, and America must continue to support them. And CAFTA is a good way to support them. CAFTA is good for our workers. It's good for our farmers. It's good for our small-business people, but it's equally as good for the folks in Central America.;By transforming our hemisphere into a powerful trading area, CAFTA will help promote democracy, security, and prosperity. The United States was built on freedom, and the more of it we have in our own backyard, the freer and safer and more prosperous America will be. The leaders from both parties here today share this vision.;These folks, who toiled in the vineyards of good international politics and worked in the White House know exactly what I'm talking about. That's why they're standing up here and saying with common voice to the United States Congress, "Let's get this bill passed." See, CAFTA is more than a trade agreement, it is a signal of our Nation's commitment to democracy and prosperity for the entire Western Hemisphere. And I urge, and we urge, the United States Congress to pass CAFTA.;Thanks for coming.</td></tr>

Bush: Message to the Congress Transmitting Legislation and Supporting Documents To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement</td><td class="c6">June 23, 2005</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement"). The Agreement represents an historic development in our relations with Central America and the Dominican Republic and reflects the commitment of the United States to supporting democracy, regional integration, and economic growth and opportunity in a region that has transitioned to peaceful, democratic societies.;In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the objectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. Central America and the Dominican Republic constitute our second largest export market in Latin America and our tenth largest export market in the world. The Agreement will create significant new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening new markets and eliminating barriers. United States agricultural exports will obtain better access to the millions of consumers in Central America and the Dominican Republic.;Under the Agreement, tariffs on approximately 80 percent of U.S. exports will be eliminated immediately. The Agreement will help to level the playing field because about 80 percent of Central America's imports already enjoy duty-free access to our market. By providing for the effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws, combined with strong remedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will contribute to improved worker rights and high levels of environmental protection in Central America and the Dominican Republic.;By supporting this Agreement, the United States can stand with those in the region who stand for democracy and freedom, who are fighting corruption and crime, and who support the rule of law. A stable, democratic, and growing Central America and Dominican Republic strengthens the United States economically and provides greater security for our citizens.;The Agreement is in our national interest, and I urge the Congress to approve it expeditiously.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Remarks Following a Cabinet Meeting and an Exchange With Reporters</td><td class="c6">July 13, 2005</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you all for coming. We have just finished our third Cabinet meeting of the year. I want to thank my Secretaries for being here today, and thank you for the briefing. Today's briefing reminded us about the strength of our economy. We had some good news today. OMB is going to announce that the 2005 deficit is $94 billion less than previously expected. In other words, revenues are coming in greater than anticipated. It's a sign that our economy is strong, and it's a sign that our tax relief plan, our progrowth policies, are working.;I told the Congress and told the country we'd cut the deficit in half by 2009. We're ahead of projections now. In other words, these numbers indicate that we're going to cut the deficit in half faster than the year 2009, so long as Congress holds the line on spending.;And so, my message to the United States Congress is: Let's be wise with the taxpayers' money. My Cabinet is committed to that, and we look forward to working with the appropriators to make sure that they spend your money wisely.;This good news on the deficit and on the budget is coupled with good economic news when it comes to job creation. Our unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. We've created more than 2 million jobs this year. More Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;Over the next couple of weeks, I look forward to working with Congress to continue progrowth policies. One is getting an energy bill. Secondly is to promote free and fair trade. And the matter at hand is a free trade agreement with our neighborhood and countries in Central America and the Dominican Republic.;Finally, I hope we can continue to press for and pass legal reform. I think it's a very important message to say to our job creators, small-business owners, that we'll have a fair legal system, and Congress has got some legal reform matters pending.;And finally—finally, finally, we want to work with Congress to pass a fiscally responsible highway bill. Again, I want to thank my Cabinet for being here.;I'll be glad to answer a couple of questions. Mark Knoller [CBS Radio], are you with us?;CIA Employee Identity Disclosure Investigation;Q. You bet. Thank you, sir. Can I ask you if you have spoken with your Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove about the Valerie Plame matter? And do you think he acted improperly in talking about it with reporters?;The President. Mark, I have instructed every member of my staff to fully cooperate in this investigation. I also will not prejudge the investigation based on media reports. We're in the midst of an ongoing investigation, and I will be more than happy to comment further once the investigation is completed.;Elaine [Elaine Quijano, Cable News Network].;Q. Mr. President, on that front, has Mr. Rove come to you and discussed—when did he discuss the fact that he had conversations with reporters about Valerie Plame? And based on that, do you feel as though it was appropriate in 2003 for your spokesman to say definitively that Karl Rove had nothing to do with the Valerie Plame incident?;The President. Elaine, we're in the midst of an ongoing investigation, and this is a serious investigation. And it is very important for people not to prejudge the investigation based on media reports. And again, I will be more than happy to comment on this matter once the investigation is complete.;Brendan [Brendan Murray, Bloomberg News].;Q. Yes, sir.;The President. Yes, Brendan.;Upcoming Supreme Court Nomination;Q. In your search for a replacement for the Supreme Court, when do you anticipate beginning to interview potential candidates, and do—would you consider candidates that come from outside the court, people that don't have experience as judges?;The President. I—we had a very good meeting yesterday. The Vice President and I met with leaders of the Senate, four Members of the United States Senate, and we talked about a lot of subjects. One of the subjects was that very subject: Would I be willing to consider people who had never been a judge. The answer is, you bet. We're considering all kinds of people— judges, non-judges. You know, Laura gave me some good advice yesterday, which is to consider women, which of course I'm doing. [ Laughter ];And in terms of the process, we're still consulting with Members of the Senate, and I anticipate continued consultations. And I say "we're consulting," it's just not me. It's members of my staff. We're—we've got a lot of contacts in the Senate on both sides of the Hill—both sides of the aisle, and people are calling in with suggestions. And I encourage them to continue to do so. I'm looking forward to their advice.;Of course, I fully recognize it's my responsibility to come up with a nominee, and I intend to do so in a—you know, in a period of time that will give me time to fully analyze the different candidates and speak to them. I'm not exactly sure when that process will begin, in terms of the interviews. And probably if I knew, I wouldn't tell you. [ Laughter ] And—but the American people can rest assured that I understand the seriousness of this responsibility and that I will name somebody who will bring dignity to the Court, someone who will be able to do the job, and someone who will sit on that bench and interpret the Constitution and not use the bench from which to legislate.;Thank you all very much.</td></tr>

Thanks for the warm welcome. It's great to be back in North Carolina. It's always good to get outside the beltway and into NASCAR country. [ Laughter ];Laura called me—she was in Africa for the past week. She called me. She's fixing to arrive in Washington this evening, but yesterday she said, "Where are you going on Friday?" I said, "I'm going to North Carolina." I said, "I'll be down there in that area where the Lowe's Motor Speedway is." She said, "Don't get any ideas." [ Laughter ] "You're having enough trouble staying on your mountain bike." [ Laughter ] She sends her very best to you all. She's doing great. I'm a lucky man when she said yes, when I asked her to marry me.;I appreciate the chance to stand with some of the finest workers in America, the men and women of Stowe Mills. I appreciate you all being here. And I thank you for giving me the chance to come and discuss an important topic, and that is, how do we make sure our job creation continues. And one way to do so is to make sure the trade we have is fair trade. That's what I'm here to talk about. I'm here to talk about making sure that people treat us the way we treat them. I want to talk to you about what they call CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement.;CAFTA is important for job creation. It's important for your jobs. CAFTA is important to help secure the democracies in our own neighborhood. And so, for the sake of our economic security and for the sake of national security, the United States House of Representatives should follow the lead of the United States Senate and pass CAFTA and get that bill to my desk.;I appreciate our Secretary of Commerce, Carlos Gutierrez, flying with me today. You know, I love America. I love the fact that people—a person like Carlos, born in Cuba, worked hard all his life, was able to succeed and is now sitting in the Cabinet with the President. What a fantastic country we have, where opportunity is open to all people.;I want to thank Congresswoman Sue Myrick for her leadership, for her strength of character, for working hard on textile customs enforcement activity. She has been a leader in making sure the North Carolina and the United States textile industry is treated fairly. I appreciate you, Sue.;You've got two fine United States Senators from North Carolina—that would be Senator Dole and Senator Burr. I enjoy working with them, and I appreciate both Members of the United States Senate from North Carolina voting for the CAFTA agreement. They understand this is good for working people here in this State.;I want to thank Dr. Pat Skinner, the president of Gaston College. Thanks for having me. I am a big believer in the community college system. I think—and I appreciate the good work the community college system does here in North Carolina. This isn't the first time I have ever been to a community college in your State. I've been to a lot of community colleges. And one reason why is because your State is on the leading edge of helping people find new skills, the skills necessary for the jobs of the 21st century. And this is a good place and an important place. And so, Dr. Skinner, thanks for having me.;I want to thank the Stowe boys—[ laughter ]—that would be Robert, Harding, and Richmond. Now, I don't know which one of you all is the boss, but I'm interested in figuring out how you figured out who was the boss. I've got a lot of brothers, myself. [ Laughter ] But I appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit. I thank you for having me. I know they care a lot about the people who work in their mills. And they're—I would call them "employee-friendly." They're people who care about the people who work with them. And so I want to thank them for coming. Thanks for letting me go by the plant.;I want to thank the mayor, Rick Coleman, of the town of Dallas. That would be Dallas, North Carolina. [ Laughter ] And I want to thank Mayor Billy Joye of Belmont. Where's Billy? Billy, you here? Billy, yes. See, Billy, they don't know our connection, do they? Billy and I flew F-102s at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston, Texas. Thank you, Billy. As we used to say, "He was a heck of a stick"—[ laughter ]—which means you're probably a heck of a mayor, Billy. Thanks for coming. Appreciate you being here.;I want to thank Allen Gant, chairman of the National—I'm not talking State— I'm talking National Council of Textile Organizations. He's here because the National Council of Textile Organizations has analyzed the CAFTA legislation and realized that this piece of legislation is good for American textile industry. And so I want to thank you for coming, Allen.;And finally, I flew down on the airplane today with one heck of an entrepreneur, somebody who has made Carolina a place of business interest, and he tells me he's slowly but surely falling in love with Charlotte, and that is Bob Johnson, head of the Charlotte Bobcats NBA basketball team. Thank you for coming, Bob. How about that story—from being raised in Mississippi to getting a good education to building his own business and now the owner of a sports team that means a lot to the people. And by the way, I think he's pretty wise. He drafted—or his club drafted, I'm sure at his insistence, two University of North Carolina Tarheels.;I met Janice Bozardt at Air Force One. She is a volunteer at Moore's Chapel United Methodist Church in Charlotte. She's been volunteering for 40 years. She leads a team of volunteers that delivers meals to families within the church and the local community. The reason I bring up Janice is because I want to remind you all that the strength of the United States of America lies in the hearts and souls of our citizens, that if you really want to— if you analyze our country to determine our greatest strength, you'll find that it exists because people hear a universal call to love a neighbor just like they'd like to be loved themselves and take time out of their lives to volunteer. Janice represents millions of people across the United States of America who are helping to change our country, one heart and one soul and one conscience at a time.;For those of you who might be listening and are interesting in serving our country, find somebody who hurts and surround them with love. Feed the hungry. Find shelter for the homeless. Teach a child to read. Love somebody like you'd like to be loved yourself, and you'll be making a significant contribution to our country. Janice, thank you for coming. Thanks for volunteering.;My most solemn obligation is to protect the American people. That's my most important duty as your President. Today, we are fighting in a global war on terror. We didn't ask for it. It came to our shores, and we're responding. We're doing our duty to not only protect our country but to put the conditions in place that will protect generations from—come. We're fighting against people who celebrate the suffering of the innocent.;I thought it was really interesting that the terrorists chose to attack in London, England, at the same time that the United States and other nations were trying to figure out how to help alleve [alleviate] * HIV/ AIDS on the continent of Africa or how to help people that are starving to death or how to help make sure young girls get educated around the world.;We were talking about a society of compassion. And these killers killed indiscriminately, men and women. They didn't care who they were. They didn't care about their religion. They murdered in the name of a totalitarian ideology. These are ideologues. They hate freedom. They reject tolerance. They despise all dissent. They have objectives. Their aim is to remake the Middle East in their own grim image of tyranny. They want to topple governments. They want to export terror. They want to force free nations to retreat.;These people will not be stopped by negotiations. They're not going to be—they won't change their mind because of concessions. There is no appeal to their reason. There is only one course of action. We will take the fight to the enemy, and we will stay in the fight until this enemy is defeated. [ Applause ] Thank you all.;We have a comprehensive strategy in place. First, we're doing a lot to protect the homeland. There's a lot of really good folks at the State, local, and Federal level who are working long hours to protect us. We're improving our intelligence gathering, and the only way to deal with and find people that are willing to hide in caves or in the shadows of our cities is to have as good of intelligence as possible. So intelligence sharing within our Government is getting better, and intelligence sharing with other governments is getting better.;And we're going to stay on the offense. And we can do all we can to protect the homeland. As I like to tell people, we have to be right 100 percent of the time, and they've got to be right once. And so therefore, you do everything you can to protect the home, but you stay on the offense against them, and you stay on the hunt. And you call people to account, free nations to account, say, "Join us in this cause of protecting ourselves.;And we are on the hunt. And we've helped change societies for the better. Iraq is a central part of this war on terror. People are heading into Iraq to try to defeat us. They can't win, militarily. The only thing they can do is to try to shake our will, is to murder in such horrific terms— like killing all those kids the other day— that the United States will say, "Well, you know, let's get out of there," before we complete our mission. They're going to fail. They don't understand the United States of America. We will not be driven out of Iraq by a bunch of thugs and assassins. We will complete the mission.;And our mission—just like in Afghanistan, our mission is to help a democracy flourish. This August you'll see the Iraqis write a constitution. And then they'll ratify the constitution. And then there will be elections for a permanent government in December. See, democracy is taking hold. A lot of people said it couldn't happen. A lot of people said, "There's no way democracy is going to take place in a place like Iraq." But the Iraqis defied the cynics, didn't they? Given a chance to vote, millions showed up to the polls. Millions defied the suiciders.;It just reminds me how universal the fuel of freedom is. See, I don't believe—I do not believe that freedom is America's gift to the world. I believe that freedom is the Almighty God's gift to each man and woman in this world, and if given a chance, people choose freedom over tyranny, hope over despair.;The second part of our mission is to train these Iraqi troops so they can do the fighting. The way I put it is this: As the Iraqis stand up, America will stand down. I know a lot of you have got relatives—who've had a loved one in Iraq. And I want to thank you on behalf of a grateful nation. You thank them on behalf of our Nation too. The American people are standing with our troops, and our troops understand what they're doing in Iraq. They're helping lay what I call the foundation of peace, because in the long run, the long run, the best way to secure the peace for generations to come is to spread freedom, and that's exactly the policy of this Government.;Here at home, we've got reason to be optimistic. This economy of ours is growing faster than any other major industrialized nation in the world. We've now had 25 consecutive months of job gains. We've recovered from the shocks of the attack and the recession and the market correction. Our unemployment rate in the United States of America is now 5 percent. That's the lowest since September of 2001, and that's lower than the average rate of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s. More Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;That's good progress. But there's more we can do. We've got to keep your taxes low. If you want to keep this economy growing, we've got to make sure that the Government doesn't run up your taxes. We've got to make sure we're wise about how we're spending your money. I don't know if you noticed the news the other day, but it turns out that when you cut taxes, the economy grows. When the economy grows, it yields more tax revenues. Over the past 5 months, the revenues have increased $94 billion greater than anticipated, which means our deficit will be $94 billion less, so long as Congress is wise about how they spend your money. And part of my job is to make sure they are wise about how we spend your money.;This economy is strong. And so the fundamental question is, what do we do to make it stronger? And that's why I'm here to talk about the Central American- Dominican Republican Free Trade Agreement. See, I think this presents us with an historic opportunity to keep this economy growing, and I'll tell you why.;First, Central American businesses and farmers can ship most of their products to America without paying any tariffs. In other words, over the past years, the Congress has decided to say, "Okay, if you grow something or make something in a Central American country, you can ship it to America duty-free." But guess what? We don't have the same rights. We can't do the same thing. We can't grow or manufacture many goods here in the United States and ship our goods to their countries duty-free. That doesn't make any sense to me. That's what I would call a—not a level playing field.;See, I told the people when I was running, "I am for free trade, but I'm also for a level playing field." And so I took a look, as did Members of the Senate and now Members of the House, at the playing field. It's not level. It's not fair to say to a farmer here in North Carolina, "You can't sell what you grow, in Central America duty-free, but they may be able to sell what they grow, here duty-free.;Last year we exported more than $15 billion—$15 billion—of goods to Central America. That's—but products are facing a heavy tariff. That's—in other words, that's what they've done, they've slapped a tax on our goods coming in.;For example, Costa Rica has a 15-percent tax on dump trucks and mobile cranes. If you're a dump truck manufacturer and a worker in a dump truck manufacturing plant, the product you're manufacturing is at a competitive disadvantage because they put a tax on it when it comes into the country.;Guatemala has a 20-percent tax on luggage. El Salvador has a 20-percent tax on polyester fabric. Nicaragua has a 10-percent tax on shrimp. Those are just some of the examples of where there is a barrier to entry. These foreign taxes on American-made products sold in the region hurt businesses, which really means they hurt jobs.;See, it makes it harder to have a job when these countries have tariffs. And yet, we don't have the tariffs in our country. And so one of the things CAFTA would do will eliminate these one-way tariffs on American products and open up a market of 44 million consumers to America's goods, services, and crops. That's what the American people have got to understand.;This deal is a good deal for workers. This basically says, "If you make a good product, it's going to be easier to sell your product to 44 million new customers." By eliminating these tariffs, CAFTA will keep this economy going. CAFTA helps American textile workers by keeping textile jobs in the U.S., and here is how: Central America is the second largest market in the world for our textile products. I don't know if people here in North Carolina know that. Think about what I just said: It is the second largest market for textile products. So if you're a textile worker, it seems like to me that one of the questions you ask, "Where do we sell our products? And if we sell our products, are we being treated fairly for the products we manufacture?;Garment factories in Central America buy yarn and fabric. That's how they operate. They buy the yarn and—I just saw some yarn and fabric made. You do a fine job, by the way. And they buy that yarn and fabric. But it's taxed before it gets into the country. In other words, it makes the product made in your plant less competitive with products made in other plants. These Central American factories are competing with Asian garment workers. And Asian— generally, they use Asian materials. See, so Central American companies need to have an incentive to continue to buy our product, and the best way to do it is to get rid of those tariffs on U.S.-made yarn, the yarn right—made in your plant.;If we can get rid of the tariffs, it is more competitive, which makes it more likely that we'll be able to—in our neigh-borhood—compete with Asian manufacturers. That's why it's a good deal for textile workers. It means the products you produce will be cheaper, less expensive in a part of the world—the second largest place where we—the second largest market for our products. And that means jobs here in America. CAFTA is good for U.S. jobs. CAFTA means textile jobs will stay right here in the United States of America.;In 2004, North Carolina exported more than $1.7 billion worth of manufactured goods to CAFTA nations, most of it textiles and apparel. Without CAFTA, the market for these textiles in Central America would likely disappear and so would thousands of jobs here.;This bill is important for North Carolina. It's important for every State. But it's— see, one of the reasons why we asked the workers to sit up here is because I want people to connect this legislation with jobs. That's what we're talking about, really. People at Stowe Mills understand this. That's why the CEO, Harding Stowe, one of the Stowe boys, and other textile manufacturers are urging Congress to pass CAFTA. That's a pretty interesting observation, isn't it, by people who know the business pretty well. In other words, they've analyzed this piece of legislation. They understand the significance. They understand that when you drop tariffs, it will help increase exports. And when you increase exports, that means more sales, which means more jobs. They know this. These are the people who have a vested interest in this piece of legislation—those are the textile manufacturers. And the textile manufacturers agree with me that the United States House of Representatives, for the good of American workers, ought to pass CAFTA legislation. And I want to thank them for being here today.;Eighty percent—80 percent of U.S. exports of consumer and industrial products will become duty-free—80 percent of what we produce here going down there. CAFTA nations bought a million dollars of American goods, including semiconductors, electronic components from Oregon, petroleum and coal from Texas, plastics from Colorado, cars trucks and autoparts from Michigan. In other words, this bill is going to have effect beyond textiles. It's going to help people who are working in manufacturing facilities all over the country.;The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that the elimination of tariffs on these goods will result in an extra billion dollars worth of U.S. manufactured exports to the region each year. That's a billion dollars more goods going into those markets, which means somebody's more likely to keep a job, or maybe somebody is more likely to find a job. In other words, this is a jobs program we're talking about.;The increase of sales is important all across our country. It provides additional opportunity. And I'm going to tell you something, this bill helps our farmers, and that's important for people to understand. Fortunately, we don't have a national security issue when it comes to agriculture. We produce more than we consume, and I want to thank our farmers for that.;I can't say the same about energy, by the way, which—that means we have a national security problem, when you're importing more energy than you produce. That's why Congress is going to get me an energy bill. I want to warn you, by signing that bill, it's not going to drop your gasoline prices, but it's finally going to put in place a strategy that will help us diversify away from foreign sources of energy, which we need to do.;But if you produce more than you consume, therefore, you've got to figure out ways to sell what you produce to somebody else. In other words, exports are really important for our farm community, and so we ought to be working to open up markets for the farmers. That's how you avoid surplus here at home.;Today, our agriculture trade with CAFTA is nearly $1.8 billion a year. That's a lot. And the American Farm Bureau Federation, they got their economists on this deal. They looked at the CAFTA agreement, and they think it would increase farm exports by additional $1.5 billion a year. If you're selling 1.8 now, and you get rid of those tariffs on your farm products, which means you're more likely to sell more product, and it goes up to 1.5 billion, that's a hefty increase, by signing this agreement. Feed grains and wheat and rice and soybeans and poultry and beef and pork and dairy and fruits and vegetables are all going to benefit from this agreement.;You mentioned—you heard me—you did hear me say pork. [ Laughter ] In North Carolina, the leading farm product is pork. You grow a lot of hogs here. [ Laughter ] And you're good at it, you're really good at it. And you grow more than we eat. Do you realize in CAFTA nations, pork now faces duties as high as 47 percent? If you're a pork producer here in North Carolina and you're looking for a place to sell your product, you want to get rid of that 47 percent tariff. You want to reduce tariffs. You want your product to be able to go into countries duty-free. You want to be treated just like we treat other nations. That's what you want, and the CAFTA bill will do just that. CAFTA is going to be good for American agriculture.;And I happen to be a person who believes that it's important to have a strong agricultural sector. And if it's good for our America agriculture, it's good for America.;I want to tell you something else about CAFTA. It will help advance a key part of our foreign policy. In the seventies and eighties, most of the CAFTA nations suffered under military dictatorships. The region was not stable. There was a lot of turmoil. And then those nations began to embrace freedom and democracy. And so we've got some young democracies right in our own neighborhood. And it's in our interest that those democracies be strong and viable.;But there's still forces that oppose democratic government there and who seek to limit economic freedom. And there are forces in the neighborhood who are hostile to our interests. Now, these small nations of CAFTA—I just met—by the way, met with the President of El Salvador today— they have made a big commitment for CAFTA. They say, "We want to do CAFTA. We'll lower our tariffs.;By the way, it makes sense for them to lower their tariffs. After all, it will help their people. It will mean that North Carolina pork will be less expensive at the stores for somebody trying to feed their family. But they've made this commitment. They said, "We want to stand with America through the CAFTA agreement." And it's really important we pass that agreement to help stabilize those countries.;We got to help the young democracies develop—deliver a better life to their own citizens. That's what this agreement means for them. It means products are less expensive. It means their businesspeople will be more likely to be able to buy plant and equipment at a better price, which will mean more jobs for the people there living in Central America. That's what that means.;It will improve—boost demand for our goods. It will help them reduce poverty. See, as wealth spreads out through the neighborhood, it will help create a vibrant middle class, and that's important. That's important. It will mean somebody is more likely to find a job close to home than trying to sneak into the United States of America to find a job. CAFTA is important foreign policy. It will help stabilize democracies, and it will help our friends grown and prosper, and that's good. That's in our interests that we do just that.;And so I'm calling on the Congress to pass CAFTA. It's a pro-jobs bill. It's a pro-growth bill. It's a pro-democracy bill. We cannot turn our backs on our friends. We cannot say to them, "For pure political reasons, we're not going to support a treaty that will not only help our own businesses, but that will help stabilize young democracies.;And so I want to thank you for giving me a chance to come by and visit with you about an important piece of legislation. I can't tell you what an honor it is to come down to North Carolina, and it's a huge honor to be the President of the United States of America.;May God bless you, and may God bless our people.</td></tr>

Under the Constitution, I have the responsibility to nominate a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. This past week, I met with Democratic and Republican leaders in the United States Senate and sought their views on the process and their thoughts on the qualities to look for in a potential nominee. Also, my staff has talked with more than 60 Members of the United States Senate. Members of the Senate are receiving a full opportunity to provide their opinions and recommendations, and I appreciate their advice.;I will be guided by clear principles as I make my decision. My nominee will be a fair-minded individual who represents the mainstream of American law and American values. The nominee will meet the highest standards of intellect, character, and ability, and will pledge to faithfully interpret the Constitution and laws of our country. Our Nation deserves, and I will select, a Supreme Court Justice that Americans can be proud of.;The American people also expect a Senate confirmation process that rises above partisanship. When I met with Senate leaders, we discussed our shared goal of making sure that the confirmation process is dignified. The nominee deserves fair treatment, a fair hearing, and a fair vote. I will make my nomination in a timely manner so the nominee can be confirmed before the start of the Court's new term in October.;The experiences of the two Justices nominated by President Clinton provide useful examples of fair treatment and a reasonable timetable for Senate action. In 1993, the Senate voted on and confirmed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court 42 days after President Clinton submitted her nomination. And despite the significant philosophical differences many Senators had with Justice Ginsburg, she received 96 votes in favor of confirmation.;The following year, Justice Stephen Breyer was confirmed 73 days after his nomination was submitted, with 87 votes in his favor. Again, Republican Senators, in large numbers, voted for confirmation of Justice Breyer despite significant philosophical differences. These examples show that the thorough consideration of a nominee does not require months of delay.;As we continue the process to fill the opening on the Supreme Court, we are also moving forward on other important priorities for the American people. This past week, we received more good news on the economy. The 2005 deficit is projected to be $94 billion less than previously expected. I told the Congress and the country we would cut the deficit in half by 2009. This week's numbers show that we are ahead of pace, so long as Congress acts wisely with taxpayer dollars.;This good news on the budget is coupled with other news that shows the economy is strong and getting stronger. Our economy is growing faster than any other major industrialized nation. The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent, lower than the average rate of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. We have created more than 2 million jobs in the past 12 months. More Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history, and homeownership in America is at an alltime high.;To keep our economy growing and creating jobs, Congress needs to continue working in the upcoming weeks on our progrowth economic agenda. First, for the sake of our economic security and our national security, the Congress must complete its work on a good energy bill that will reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy.;Second, the House needs to follow the Senate's lead by approving the Central American and Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. By lowering trade barriers for our exports, this agreement will level the playing field for America's goods, services, and crops, and help create jobs for American workers.;Third, Congress needs to send me a fiscally responsible highway bill that modernizes roads and bridges, improves safety, and opens up new job opportunities.;Finally, Congress needs to move forward with Social Security reform. For those of you who were born before 1950, Social Security will not change. But the system has made promises to our younger workers that it cannot pay for, and the cost of fixing the system grows higher with every year we wait. So Congress needs to act now to strengthen Social Security for our children and grandchildren.;The American people expect members of both parties to offer a positive agenda and get things done for our country. By working together in the weeks ahead, I am confident we will achieve positive results for all Americans.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks on the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement</td><td class="c6">July 21, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thank you all. Sientese. Thank you very much for the warm welcome. Thank you to the Hispanic Alliance for Free Trade for inviting me here today. And thanks to the Organization for American States for providing this fantastic forum.;What a beautiful building. What makes it even more beautiful is that the Organization of American States promotes democracy and freedom. There's nothing more beautiful than freedom. And I appreciate your commitment to democracy and freedom. And I appreciate the chance to come to talk about a treaty, CAFTA, that will not only provide more prosperity in our hemisphere, it's not only a good deal for American workers and businessowners and farmers, this treaty will help spread democracy and peace.;Thanks for letting me come by. Raul, thank you. Muchas gracias. It's good to see you again. Raul is such a strong leader in the Latino community in my State of Texas that he had the high honor of having a school named for him. I can't thank you enough for being the leader you have been. And thank you and Alonzo for inviting me here today and for helping us get the bill passed.;For those of you who are members of the Hispanic Alliance for Free Trade, I want to remind you, it's one thing to come and listen to a President speak, it's another thing to work the Halls of Congress, so people speak by their votes, people that listen to you in a concrete way. So thanks for coming. Thanks for being a part of passing CAFTA.;I want to thank the Secretary General, General Insulza. Thank you, sir, for you. I want to thank the Vice President, Samuel Lewis, of the Republic of Panama. I appreciate the members of the diplomatic corps who are here. I particularly want to thank the diplomats from Central America and the Dominican Republic. I urge you to work the bill. I urge you to let people know the consequence of passage and the consequences of failure. It's important for people to understand the stakes.;I want to thank the permanent representatives to the Organization of American States. I want to thank my friend Ambassador Juan Maisto— Embajador. Thank you, Juan, for being here.;I appreciate the members of my Cabinet who are working hard on this piece of legislation. We got the Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Johanns, who is with us. Secretary Carlos Gutierrez is with us here. Ambassador Rob Portman, who is the point person from my administration on this important piece of legislation. They're working hard, I'm working hard.;I want to thank the people from the United States Congress who've joined us. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida, I'm glad you're here. Thanks for coming. Randy Neugebauer from west Texas, thank you for coming, Randy. Henry Cuellar, de south Texas, del sur de Tejas, and finally, Charlie Dent, thanks for coming. I'm proud you all are here. Thanks for lending your support to this important occasion. I've made my decision to support this bill because I think it's in the best interest of the country.;As a matter of fact, I make a lot of decisions as your President. I made one the other night, when I announced my nomination of Judge John Roberts to the Supreme Court. I appreciate so very much the reception he's receiving in the United States Senate. I want to thank the Senators from both political parties who are giving Judge Roberts a chance to talk about his heart, to talk about his philosophy.;He is a person that will make all Americans proud to be a member of the Supreme Court. He is a—he's got the experience, wisdom, fairness, and civility to be a really good judge. He has a profound respect for the rule of law. He respects the liberties guaranteed in our Constitution to all Americans, from—people from all walks of life. He'll strictly apply the Constitution. He's not going to legislate from the bench.;The United States Senate can show our country that it's able to have a civil debate on this very important nomination, not only a civil debate but a timely debate. It's important for Judge Roberts to be confirmed by the time the Court reconvenes in October. I thank the Senate for their action today. I urge the Senate to do its duty to have a fair, timely hearing and get this good man confirmed in time for the October reconvening of the Court.;We'll be talking about our economy and liberty in our neighborhood here in a minute, but I want to remind you all, want to remind leaders from our country and of course the leaders from other countries that are here, that we're living in historic times. And one of the reasons I say that is we're still at war, see. And it's important for all of us who love freedom to understand that this is a war being fought against ideologues that use terror to advance an agenda. This is a war against killers, cold-blooded killers who embrace an ideology of hatred. Their vision of the world is the opposite of our vision of the world. We believe in human rights, human dignity, minority rights, and religious rights. We believe in universal freedoms.;They have a different view of the world. They don't believe in women's rights. They have usurped a great religion and defined it in their terms. And if you happen to live in a society in which they're dominant, like the Taliban was in Afghanistan, and if you don't adhere to their view of religion, you're punished. They have territorial designs. They have the desire to use their terrorist techniques to frighten us. In other words, they understand when they kill in cold blood, it ends up on our TV screens. And they're trying to shake our will. And they're trying to create vacuums into which their ideology can move.;They don't understand our country, though. They don't understand that when it comes to the defense of universal freedoms, this country won't be frightened. We will defend ourselves by staying on the offense against these killers. We will find them overseas so we don't have to face them here at home. And at the same time, we understand that to defeat an ideology of hate, you work to spread an ideology of hope. And there's nothing more hopeful than a system which recognizes the rights of people, in which government is accountable to the people. And that system is democracy, based upon universal freedom.;We are laying the foundation for peace for generations to come. As we fight the terrorists and defend this homeland, we're also working to make sure this economy is strong and vibrant, and we've got reason for optimism. The tax relief we delivered is working. This economy of ours has overcome a lot, and now it's the fastest-growing economy of any major industrialized nation in the world. Inflation is low. We're well ahead of reaching our goal to cut our deficit in half by 2009. We've had 25 consecutive months of job gains. The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent. More people are working today in America than ever before in our Nation's history.;And one of the reasons why is because this administration recognizes that the way you grow an economy is you stimulate the entrepreneurial sector. Government doesn't create wealth. Government creates an environment in which the entrepreneur is willing to take risk. And I'm pleased to report the entrepreneurial spirit in our Latino communities across the country is strong, vibrant, and doing well.;We believe in encouraging ownership. The more people own something, the better off this country will be. We want more people owning their own business. Because of the vibrancy of our economy, the Hispanic unemployment rate has dropped to 5.8 percent, down from 8.4 percent 2 years ago. More people are working. More Hispanics own their home than ever before in our Nation's history, and that's great news for the American society. SBA loans to Hispanic-owned businesses are up by— doubled since I took office. In other words, there is a role for Government to help. But the Hispanic community is an entrepreneurial community to begin with, and it's responding, and it's really good news for the country.;Therefore, it doesn't surprise me to learn that many Hispanic entrepreneurs and businessowners and leaders understand the importance of expanding trade within our hemisphere. And that is why you have come to lend your support to the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, and I'm grateful. By eliminating barriers to exports from our country, CAFTA will help keep the U.S. economy growing. In other words, this is a jobs program. This will help jobs.;By opening up Central America and the Dominican Republic to U.S. trade and investment, CAFTA will help those countries develop a better life for their citizens. That seems to make sense to me. I mean, if you're living in a neighborhood, you want your neighbors doing well. If you're a good neighbor, you say, "Gosh, I hope everybody in the neighborhood is succeeding." And by helping those economies improve, CAFTA will help the nations strengthen their democracies. And that's in our national security interest. That's makes us all more secure.;So this bill is more than a trade bill. This bill is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere. And that's important for Members of Congress to understand.;CAFTA begins by ensuring that free trade is fair trade. I mean—you know, I traveled the country quite extensively in the recent past and said, "I'm a free trader." But I reminded people in our country, I'm also for fair trade. It's one thing to advocate free trade. I believe the Government has a role to make sure that trade is fair for all of us. In other words, we want people treating us the way we treat them.;It turns out that exports from Central America into the United States face almost no tariffs. Now, I don't see how a Member of Congress can go back to his or her district and say this is a good deal for America, when our exports to Central America face hefty tariffs. In other words, if you're for free trade you ought to be insisting that the trade be fair. And the only thing that makes the trade fair to me, seems like, is to say to our friends in Central America, "Just treat us the way we treat you.;And that's what CAFTA does. It eliminates tariffs on our goods and services going into Central America. In other words, they treat us the way we treat them. It levels the playing field, which makes this a good deal for America's farmers and small-business owners and manufacturers.;Last year, United States businesses exported more than $15 billion of goods to Central America. Now, when I say "export goods," people have got to understand that means somebody is more likely to have a job. It means somebody is producing something that somebody wants in Central America, which is part of the employment picture in our country. Our business leaders say that CAFTA would significantly increase exports to the region. That's why I say this is a job program. As exports go up, somebody is either more likely to find a job or somebody is more likely to retain a job.;Take this example—California's Haas Automation Company. It is the largest machine tool manufacturer in the United States. They strongly support this piece of legislation. It says that with CAFTA, it expects to increase sales to Central America tenfold. In other words, they see business opportunity, which means job opportunity for somebody who's helping Haas Automation manufacture equipment that somebody in Central America wants to purchase.;Again, another company example here. It's called Bush Hog. I don't know why they would have put this example in this speech. [ Laughter ] I hope it wasn't named after me. [ Laughter ] But it is an Alabama company that makes farm equipment like backhoes and tillers and rotary cutters. And the folks at Bush Hog say that farmers in Central America would find their high-quality, made-in-the-United States machinery attractive if the tariffs on that equipment would be eliminated. So when you hear me say "tariff," that really means it's pricing our equipment out of the reach of the market. That's what a tariff does. It's like a tax.;So the good folks at Bush Hog manufacture something somebody wants to buy, but it's too pricey, not because of the cost of the product they produce but because of Government action. And so the purpose of NAFTA [CAFTA] * is to remove the trade barriers. Now, we've had people look at this piece of legislation, and the National Association of Manufacturers, people that represent people who manufacture something here in America, say that CAFTA would increase our manufacture exports to the region by a billion dollars, a 7-percent increase. That's good news for the manufacturing sector of the American economy.;The American Farm Bureau—they represent farmers, needless to say—estimate that by the time CAFTA is fully implemented, it would increase U.S. farm exports by as much as $1.5 billion. Let me talk about farming real quick. We produce more than we consume in the United States. And therefore, it makes sense for Government policy and for our Secretary of Agriculture to work to find markets for that which we produce. And if the products we produce are taxed via tariff, it makes those products more expensive than need be. And therefore, by reducing tariffs on agricultural exports from the United States, it opened up markets for our ranchers and farmers.;The U.S. International Trade Commission says that by passing CAFTA, we will reduce trade deficit by more than $750 million. So, in other words, this bill is good for the overall financial picture of the United States. That's why the United States House of Representatives, next week, ought to understand the economic wisdom of this bill and open up the market of 44 million consumers to U.S. businesses, U.S. farms, and U.S. manufacturers.;CAFTA includes strong enforcement provisions that go further than previous trade agreements. To protect our textile workers from unfair competition, CAFTA gives our Customs agents the ability to conduct surprise visits on Central American factories. It's one way you make sure trade is fair, you're being treated fairly.;To promote a cleaner environment, CAFTA includes provisions that will monitor and enforce environmental progress. To ensure that Central American factories abide by acceptable labor standards, CAFTA insists on stiff fines for violations. And the United States Government has committed about $180 million over 5 years to ensure that labor laws are enforced. CAFTA is a trade agreement that will be enforced, and we've got the money in the budget to do so.;CAFTA will help the nations of Central America deliver prosperity and opportunity for their citizens. Let me repeat that. CAFTA is not only good for us, it's good for their partners. That's a fair deal. That's what you want. You want an agreement to be balanced and fair. We want the agreement to be good for us, but we also want the agreement to be good for our friends. It's a lousy deal if it's a zero-sum deal. This is a good deal for CAFTA nations.;CAFTA will help nations attract investment they need for their economies to grow. In other words, with a stable trading agreement with the United States, it will make it much easier for investment to flow to our CAFTA friends. And investment means growth and opportunity. That's what that means.;By reducing tariffs on our products, CAFTA will allow consumers in their countries to enjoy goods and services at better prices. If a country doesn't produce a lot of a particular product and they need it and it's got a tariff on it, it means the consumers pay an additional price. By reducing tariffs, it means that consumers in the CAFTA nations will be able to more likely purchase that which they want at a better price. It seems like to make sense to me that if you lower the cost of food products coming from the United States to CAFTA, that's beneficial for a mom trying to buy food for her child. This is consumer-friendly in the CAFTA countries.;By lowering tariffs, CAFTA will give Central American businesses less costly access to high-quality machinery. In other words, it's going to be beneficial for the small-business owner or the large-business owner, the person who employs people in the CAFTA country to be able to buy machinery necessary to stay competitive.;By bringing economic growth—in other words, these are all elements of creating growth, increasing consumer demand by lowering prices, increasing investment, make it more likely people will be able to purchase the equipment they need to stay competitive. All this leads to more growth, which will help contribute to a vibrant middle class. And that's what we want in our neighborhood. We want there to be prosperity. We want people to have a better chance at a better life. It's in our Nation's advantage that prosperity grow throughout the neighborhood.;Elected leaders of Central America know that by opening up their nations' markets to competition, they're helping to raise standards for their own businesses and farmers. In other words, if you protect industries, it tends to become noncompetitive. It's very important for our societies to remain productive, and productivity increases happen because of competition.;By giving their garmentmakers an incentive to use U.S. fabrics and materials, our partners are creating really a regional partnership that will help both of us, both the CAFTA nations and the Dominican Republic and the United States, compete with Asian producers that are using Asian materials. And that's important for Members of Congress to understand, that if we want to—this agreement will help us remain competitive with Asian producers on certain products.;People of Central America have made their choice. They know their economic future lies in free and fair trade with the United States. They've said, "We want to join with the United States." And that's important. When this bill is passed, this country will be sending a strong message: We want to join with you as well. You want to join with us in free and fair trade, we want to join with you. And it's that alliance of interest that will make this neighborhood better. And it's important for Members of Congress to understand that.;We cannot and should not reject these young democracies. We must support democracy in our neighborhood. And CAFTA will strengthen democracies. CAFTA nations a while ago were struggling with dictatorship and tyranny and civil strife. It wasn't all that long ago that a lot of our foreign policy was occupied by actions that had been taken by governments in Central America. Today, I'm more than proud to welcome democracies to the Oval Office. These are peaceful countries. These are freedom-loving countries.;The leaders of these nations have made impressive gains toward establishing—firmly establishing democracy. But these gains cannot be taken for granted. And that's important for Members of the United States House of Representatives to understand clearly. Democracy cannot be taken for granted. We must provide the foundation for democracy through smart policy. CAFTA's smart policy. It's good trade policy. It makes it more likely somebody is going to be able to work in America when we pass CAFTA, but it also helps the neighborhood.;You see, there's no democracy—those new democracies in Central America still face forces that oppose democratic government. Make no mistake about it: There are people in our own neighborhood that oppose democracy, they're trying to separate our friends from the United States by sewing resentment and anger. People of this region need to see that democracy produces more than just free elections, that democracy produces measurable progress in their lives. As the oldest democracy in this hemisphere, we have a moral obligation and a vital interest in helping the Central American economies and societies succeed. And therefore, CAFTA needs to be passed.;By strengthening democracy in the region, CAFTA will lead to greater security and stability. I appreciate so very much the hard work of the Central American leadership. I've had a chance to visit with these good folks. As a matter of fact, they've been coming to America quite often, and I've been going there sometimes. And that's important. That's what friends do. They strategize. They talk. The American people have got to understand, we've got friends in the leadership in Central America. And they're working hard to punish corruption and keep the streets safe. They're working hard to make sure they have a society that respects human rights and the rule of law. We're working together to nail the drug traffickers and terrorists and criminal gangs who feed on lawlessness and instability.;CAFTA will strengthen those who are taking on the forces of radicalism and violence in this hemisphere, and it will make our country more secure. As former Governor of a State that shares a long border with Mexico, I know first hand the importance of improving ties with our neighbors. It's really important that we've got strong ties in a neighborhood in which you live. I understand the importance of removing trade barriers that make it difficult for our businesses and farmers to compete.;This bill that the House of Representatives will be voting on next week is pro-jobs, pro-growth, and pro-democracy. It is important that we pass this piece of legislation. And I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come and talk about its importance. And I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing, is talking to Members of the United States Congress and remind them, set aside partisan politics for the good of the United States of America. It's in our economic interests, it's in our national security interests that the House of Representatives join the United States Senate and pass that CAFTA bill, which I'll proudly sign on behalf of America's workers and small businesses and those of us who love and cherish democracy.;May God bless you.</td></tr>

The agreement is more than a trade bill;it is a commitment of freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the Western Hemisphere. We have a moral obligation and a vital national security interest in helping the democracies of Central America and the Dominican Republic succeed, and CAFTA furthers that goal. I look forward to signing this important legislation into law.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks on Signing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005</td><td class="c6">July 29, 2005</td><td class="c7">Welcome. Good morning. In a few moments, I'll have the honor of signing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005. This bill is a critical step toward our goal of ensuring top-quality, patient-driven health care for all Americans.;With this law, we'll be able to obtain more accurate information about medical treatments. And by providing doctors with information about what treatments work and what treatments cause problems, we will reduce medical errors that injure and cause the deaths of thousands of Americans each year.;I commend the Members of Congress for their hard work in passing this piece of legislation. This has been a productive week for the United States Senate and the House of Representatives. I'm looking forward to signing an energy bill that will encourage conservation, increase domestic production, and help reduce our dependence on foreign oil. I'm looking forward to signing a highway bill that will strengthen our transportation infrastructure and improve the safety of our roads and create jobs.;I appreciate the House and the Senate for passing the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement that will level the playing field for America's goods as well as promote democracy in our hemisphere. All these bills are good bills. They're good for the people of this country. And I appreciate their hard work in getting them to my desk.;I want to thank the Secretary of Health and Human Services for joining us, Mike Leavitt. I appreciate Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, Dr. Bill Frist. [ Laughter ] I want to thank Committee Chairman Mike Enzi, Senator Judd Gregg, and Ted Kennedy and Jim Jeffords for their good work in the United States Senate on this piece of legislation. I appreciate my friend from Texas, Joe Barton—Congressman Joe Barton and Nathan Deal and Mike Bilirakis for joining me here today as I sign this piece of legislation.;I want to thank Dr. Edward Hill, who is the president of the American Medical Association, straight out of Mississippi. [ Laughter ] I appreciate Dr. Sophia Smith, who is the Children's National Medical Center, Dr. Janis Orlowski, who is the senior vice president of the Washington Hospital Center, and Susan Mintz—Suzanne Mintz, the president of the National Family Caregivers Association. Thank you all for coming. I also want to welcome our professionals who are here with us today.;The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act will help ensure that Americans continue to benefit from the greatest medical system in the world. To maintain the highest standards of care, doctors and nurses must be able to exchange information about problems and solutions. Yet in recent years, many doctors have grown afraid to discuss their practices because they worry that the information they provide will be used against them in a lawsuit.;This bill will help solve that problem. This is a commonsense law that gives legal protections to health professionals who report their practices to patient safety organizations. By providing critical information about medical procedures, doctors and nurses can help others learn from their experiences. That's why I said it's a commonsense law. By making essential information more available across America, we will help ensure that patients benefit from the best medical treatment, no matter where they live. That seems to make sense to me.;This bill builds on other commonsense reforms we're making to the American health care system. By providing a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, we're giving seniors more choices and helping them get the medicine they need. By making health savings accounts more broadly available, we're helping more Americans own and control their own health coverage. By increasing funding for community health centers, we're helping the poor and the uninsured get the quality health care they deserve and need.;We'll continue working to improve our health care system. To make it easier for employers to offer coverage to their workers, we must allow small businesses to join together to buy insurance at the same discounts that big businesses can do. To reduce costs and improve care, we must harness the power of information technology to computerize health records.;And we've got to stop the frivolous lawsuits that are running up the cost of medicine and driving good professionals out of this important profession. We need medical liability reform now. The bill I sign today is an example of people coming together to do what's right for the country.;Again, I want to thank the Members of Congress who are here. It is now my honor to sign this good bill into law.</td></tr>

Bush: The President's Radio Address</td><td class="c6">July 30, 2005</td><td class="c7">Good morning. This year Congress and I have addressed many key priorities of the American people, and we're making great progress.;At the start of the year, I urged Congress to ease the burden of junk lawsuits on American workers, businesses, and families, so Congress passed, and I signed bipartisan class-action reform. We called for restoring integrity to the bankruptcy process, so Congress passed, and I signed commonsense reform of our Nation's bankruptcy laws. I requested vital funds for our men and women in uniform, so Congress passed, and I proudly signed critical legislation to give our troops the resources they need to fight and win the war on terror.;This past week has brought even more progress, with four major achievements. First, I signed into law a patient safety bill that will improve our health care system by reducing medical errors. Second, Congress came to an agreement on a highway bill that will improve safety, modernize our roads and bridges, and create jobs. Third, Congress passed the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. This historic agreement will reduce barriers to American goods, services, and crops, and make our Nation more secure by strengthening the young democracies in our neighborhood.;Finally, after years of debate, Republicans and Democrats in Congress came together to pass a comprehensive energy plan that will reduce America's dependence on foreign sources of energy. This bill will encourage conservation and efficiency, increase domestic production, promote alternative and renewable resources, and modernize the electricity grid. I thank the Members of Congress who worked so hard on this vital legislation, and I look forward to signing it into law.;As Members of Congress return home for their August recess, I plan to travel to seven States around the country. I will talk to Americans about our growing economy. Thanks to the tax relief we passed and the spending restraint, our economy today is growing faster than any other major industrialized country. The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent, lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. We created more than 2 million jobs in the past 12 months. More Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;The 2005 deficit is projected to be $94 billion less than previously expected, and we're now ahead of the pace needed to meet my goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.;We have more to do, and I will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job. I look forward to talking to the American people about our plans to continue strengthening the economic security of America's seniors and working families.;During August, I will also meet with our troops and their families and update the American people on the latest developments in the war on terror. We have a comprehensive strategy in place. We're improving our homeland security and intelligence. The House renewed the key provisions of the PATRIOT Act that were set to expire at the end of this year, and I call on the Senate to do the same.;We're also spreading freedom, because free countries are peaceful. And we're staying on the offensive against the terrorists, fighting them abroad so we do not have to face them here at home.;I also urge Members of the Senate to use August to prepare to act on my nomination of Judge John Roberts to serve on the Supreme Court. This talented and capable man will fairly interpret the Constitution and laws, not legislate from the bench. Judge Roberts's time on the DC Circuit Court, his service at the Department of Justice and at the White House in two administrations, his impressive career as a top attorney in private practice, and his stellar academic and legal background demonstrate why Americans of all points of view have expressed their support for him.;One of the highest honors for any lawyer is to argue a case before the Supreme Court. In his extraordinary career, Judge Roberts has argued a remarkable 39 cases before the Nation's highest court. I look forward to working with the Senate in the weeks ahead so that Judge Roberts can receive a timely and dignified hearing and be confirmed before the Court reconvenes on October the 3d.;Our achievements so far this year show how much can be done when we come together to do what is right for the American people. When Congress returns in September, I will continue to work with the Republicans and Democrats to build on this good progress for all Americans.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks on Signing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act</td><td class="c6">August 2, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thanks for the warm welcome. Welcome to the White House. Last week, Congress passed the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. I want to thank the Republicans and Democrats who came together to support this important agreement. The bill I'm about to sign is good for America. I'm pleased that Congress has taken a step to eliminate the barriers to America's goods and crops to 44 million customers.;I welcome the opportunity to make our Nation more secure by strengthening our ties with democracies that share our belief in free markets and free government. I appreciate the vision and leadership of Bob Zoellick and Rob Portman and the many others who worked hard to get this agreement passed. I want to thank the Secretary of State, Condi Rice, for the outstanding job she's doing on behalf of the American people. I want to thank Secretary Mike Johanns from the Department of Agriculture for joining us. And Stephanie, thank you for being here. I appreciate Secretary Carlos Gutierrez of the Department of Commerce for his good work.;We're honored to be joined by the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dick Lugar. I appreciate you coming, Senator. I'm honored you're here. Senator Norm Coleman, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. I appreciate Congressman Clay Shaw, who is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee. I'm honored that these three Members of Congress are standing with us today.;I appreciate los Embajadores from the Central American countries, Ambassador Duenas, Ambassador Stadthagen, Ambassador Espinal, Ambassador Castillo de Guatemala. By the way, Espinal is Dominican Republic, Ambassador Stadthagen is from Nicaragua, Duenas is from Costa Rica. I appreciate Ambassador Leon from El Salvador, who is with us. I want to thank the Special Envoy Garcia from Honduras. I appreciate Anna Escobar, who is the Vice President of El Salvador, for joining us. Bienvenidos. And I want to thank Jose Insulza, who is the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, for joining us. Welcome.;All of us in this room understand that to keep our economy growing and creating jobs, we need to open markets for American products overseas. All of us understand that strengthening our economic ties with our democratic neighbors is vital to America's economic and national security interests. And all of us understand that by strengthening ties with democracies in our hemisphere, we are advancing the stability that comes from freedom.;Right now Central American goods face almost no tariffs when they enter the United States. By contrast, U.S. exports to Central America still face hefty tariffs there. CAFTA will end these unfair tariffs against American products and help ensure that free trade is fair trade.;By leveling the playing field for our products, CAFTA will help create jobs and opportunities for our citizens. As CAFTA helps create jobs and opportunity in the United States, it will help the democracies of Central America and the Dominican Republic deliver a better life for their citizens. By further opening up their markets, CAFTA will help those democracies attract the trade and investment needed for economic growth.;This economic growth will boost demand for U.S. goods and reduce poverty and contribute to the rise of a vibrant middle class. This economic growth will raise working standards and will deliver hope and opportunity to people who have made the choice for freedom. The more opportunity that Central Americans have at home to provide for themselves and their families means it's less likely that someone looking for a job will try to come to this country illegally.;By strengthening the democracies in the region, CAFTA will enhance our Nation's security. Two decades ago, many of the CAFTA nations struggled with poverty and dictatorship and civil strife. Today, they're working democracies, and we must not take these gains for granted. These nations still face forces that oppose democracy, seek to limit economic freedom, and want to drive a wedge between the United States and the rest of the Americas. The small nations of CAFTA are making big and brave commitments, and CAFTA is a signal that the United States will stand with them and support them. By helping the CAFTA nations build free societies, we'll help them eliminate the lawlessness and instability that terrorists and criminals and drug traffickers feed on. And this will make our country safer.;CAFTA is more than a trade bill, it is a commitment among freedom-loving nations to advance peace and prosperity throughout the region. As the oldest democracy in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has a moral obligation and a vital national security interest in helping democracies in our neighborhood succeed, and CAFTA advances this goal.;And to ensure that the 21st century is one of prosperity and freedom and security, my administration will continue to work to strengthen democracy and open markets for American exports all across the world.;And now it's my honor to invite the Members of the Congress to join me as I sign the legislation that will implement the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement.</td></tr>

Bush: The President's Radio Address</td><td class="c6">August 6, 2005</td><td class="c7">Good morning. As families across the country enjoy the summer, Americans can be optimistic about our economic future.;In the past 4 years, our economy has been through a lot. We faced a stock market decline, a recession, corporate scandals, an attack on our homeland, and the demands of an ongoing war on terror. To grow the economy and help American families, we acted by passing the largest tax relief in a generation. And today, thanks to the tax relief and the efforts of America's workers and entrepreneurs, our economy is strong and growing stronger.;This past week, we learned that America added over 200,000 new jobs in July. Since May of 2003, we've added nearly 4 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent, below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. And more Americans are working today than ever before in our Nation's history.;Recent economic reports show that our economy is growing faster than any other major industrialized nation. Small businesses are flourishing. Workers are taking home more of what they earn. Real disposable personal income has grown by over 12 percent since the end of 2000. Inflation is low, and mortgage rates are low. And over the past year, the homeownership rate in America has reached record levels.;The tax relief stimulated economic vitality and growth, and it has helped increase revenues to the Treasury. The increased revenues and our spending restraint have led to good progress in reducing the Federal deficit. Last month we learned that the deficit is now projected to be $94 billion less than previously expected. I set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and we are ahead of pace to meet that goal.;To continue creating jobs and to ensure that our prosperity reaches every corner of America, we're opening markets abroad for our goods and services. This past week, I was proud to sign the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. This historic agreement will level the playing field for America's workers and farmers and open up a market of 44 million customers for products made in the United States.;To keep our economy growing, we also need affordable, reliable supplies of energy.;Next week in New Mexico, I'll sign a bipartisan energy bill that encourages conservation, expands domestic production in environmentally sensitive ways, diversifies our energy supply, modernizes our electricity grid, and makes America less dependent on foreign sources of energy. And next Wednesday in Illinois, I'll sign a highway bill that will improve the safety of our roads, strengthen our transportation infrastructure, and create good jobs.;Our economy is strong, yet I will not be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job. So this coming Tuesday, I will meet with my economic team in Texas to discuss our agenda to keep the economy moving forward. As Congress considers appropriations bills this fall, we will work with the House and the Senate to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely or not at all.;We need to make the tax relief permanent, end the death tax forever, and make our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more progrowth. We'll continue working on Social Security reform. Social Security is sound for today's seniors, but there's a hole in the safety net for our younger workers, so I'll work with the Congress to strengthen Social Security for our children and grandchildren. I'll continue to press for legal reform to protect small businesses, doctors, and hospitals from junk lawsuits. And we will work to make health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans.;The American economy is the envy of the world, and we will keep it that way. We will continue to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of America so more of our citizens can realize the American Dream.;Thank you for listening.</td></tr>

Bush: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2006</td><td class="c6">September 14, 2005</td><td class="c7">Presidential Determination No. 2005-36;Memorandum for the Secretary of State;Subject: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2006;Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228)(FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.;A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug-transit or drug-producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions, establish selected community development projects, and strengthen Venezuela's political party system is vital to the national interests of the United States.;I have removed China and Vietnam from the list of major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries because there is insufficient evidence to suggest that China is a major source zone or transit country for illicit narcotics that significantly affect the United States. There is insufficient evidence to refute claims by the Government of Vietnam that they have virtually eliminated opium poppy production. Additionally, although cooperation with United States law enforcement is limited, there are no indications of a significant Vietnam-based drug threat to the United States.;Despite the Government of Afghanistan's counternarcotics efforts, we remain concerned about the disturbing magnitude of the drug trade and the prospect that opium poppy cultivation will likely increase in 2006. We are also concerned about government corruption, especially at the regional and local levels, impeding counternarcotics efforts. For these efforts to be effective, government corruption with respect to the opium economy must be seriously addressed--by both local and central government authorities.;The Government of Canada has made real progress in curbing the diversion into the United States of pseudoephedrine, which fuels the production of methamphetamine. There are indications, however, that Canadian-based criminal groups are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA (Ecstasy) destined for the United States. Large scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown marijuana remains a serious concern. The United States appreciates the excellent law enforcement cooperation with Canada in combating these shared threats.;While Haiti made efforts this year to improve its performance, we reiterate our concerns from last year about the Interim Government of Haiti's inability to effectively organize Haitian law enforcement resources to permit sustained counternarcotics efforts. Further, the national criminal justice system must be significantly strengthened in order to be effective and gain public confidence.;The Government of The Netherlands has achieved considerable success in countering the production and flow of MDMA (Ecstasy) to the United States, and The Netherlands is commended for its enhanced efforts. In the coming year, the United States would like to build upon our law enforcement cooperation with the Dutch government through advancements in mutual legal assistance and direct engagement between our respective police agencies.;Drug trafficking, money laundering, and other organized criminal activity in Nigeria remain major sources of concern to the United States. Progress over the past year on anti-money laundering controls is welcome, but much remains to be done to make such controls effective. Implementing anti-corruption policies must advance more quickly, as corruption at all levels of government continues to hamper effective narcotics law enforcement. In addition, measures similar to those taken to improve drug law enforcement at Nigeria's main airport need to be expanded to, and replicated at, Nigeria's seaports, where drug trafficking is a growing concern. Finally, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other counternarcotics institutions should work towards developing the mindset and capacity to pursue investigations, and prosecutions of major drug traffickers based in the country.;We remain concerned with the continued involvement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in criminal activity, including drug production and drug trafficking. Given the close relationship between Japanese and Chinese criminal elements and DPRK drug traffickers in past smuggling incidents, there is a real possibility of continuing DPRK involvement in drug trafficking, even when a given incident appears only to involve ethnic Chinese or other organized Asian criminal groups.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.;George W. Bush</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Reception Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month</td><td class="c6">October 7, 2005</td><td class="c7">The President. Gracias, y bienvenidos a la Casa Blanca. Thank you for coming. It is such an honor to have you here to help celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It's a month in which we can recognize the contributions that Hispanic Americans make to our great land.;The Hispanic community is known for its strong commitment to the familia y fe and a great love of our country. Here's what I think: I think Hispanic Americans— I don't think, I know Hispanic Americans have helped build our country and shape our culture, and the United States is better off because of the Hispanic influence.;I appreciate so very much that members of my administration have come. I told them they could take a little time off from work. [ Laughter ] Carlos Gutierrez, the Secretary of Commerce, and his wife, Edi, thank you for coming. El juez, the Attorney General of the United States, Al Gonzales, and his wife, Becky. Hector Barreto, head of the SBA. Newly confirmed as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Israel Hernandez. Congratulations.;We've got Members of the Congress who are here. Wayne Allard, thank you for coming. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Marilyn Musgrave, Henry Cuellar, Luis Fortuno, thank you all for being here. It's such an honor you're here. Hans Hertell, an Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, members of the diplomatic corps, thank you all for coming. It's nice of you to join us today. Los Embajadores.;It is good to see my friend, Emilio Estefan. Thank you for coming, Emilio. Hector Gomez, Major League Soccer player from the L.A. Galaxy is with us. Christian Gomez, Major League Soccer player from D.C. United. Strong right-hander from the Washington Nats, Esteban Loaiza. Gracias, thank you all for coming. We're proud you're here. I appreciate members of the Latino organizations who are here today. Thank you for working on behalf of Latino citizens around the country.;As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we honor the promise of freedom and opportunity that brought either you or your ancestors to America. That's what we're honoring. We're honoring the fact that this is a free society, and we recognize our responsibility to ensure that everyone in this country has a chance to realize their God-given talents and to realize their dreams. That's what America is all about. America must always be a land of dreamers, and people will have a chance to realize those dreams.;The 21st century opportunity begins with a quality education. You can't be a land of dreams if you don't educate your kids. One of my biggest concerns was that sometimes in our public schools, if your parents didn't speak English, for example, you just got shuffled through. And that was unacceptable to me and unacceptable to many Members of the United States Congress.;I came together for the—with the Congress to challenge what I've called the soft bigotry of low expectations, to encourage school systems all around America to raise standards and raise the bar and measure to make sure that every child is learning to read and write and add and subtract. And if not, if they find they're not learning to read and write and add and subtract, do something about it early, before it's too late.;And so the No Child Left Behind Act became the law. And that law is beginning to make an enormous difference in the lives of Latino youngsters. And I can tell you how I know: It's because we measure. We know. People are learning to read and write and add and subtract, and that's going to make America a better place for generations to come.;Secondly, we've got to make sure that this is a country where work is respected and work is rewarded, where people who want to work hard to own their own business are able to do so. I believe it's important to keep taxes low in order to make sure entrepreneurs are able to get their business started and keep their businesses running.;I know it's important to have legal reform and regulatory reform to make sure the environment is such that entrepreneurs of all walks of life have a chance to flourish. I am proud to report to you that Latino-owned businesses are on the rise in the United States of America. And America is better for it when people are able to create jobs and own their own business.;I mentioned Hector Barreto being here. The Small Business Administration has more than doubled the number of loans to Hispanic-owned businesses since 2001. Our goal is to get people a chance to realize their dream of owning their own business. And one of the reasons why we're creating jobs in America, that Carlos talked about, is because the small-business sector is strong. Any strong economy must have a strong business sector. And the strong— the business sector is going to be even stronger because of Latino-owned businesses.;I set a goal of 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of this decade. I'm proud to report the number of minority homeowners has increased by 2.2 million since I set the goal. See, I love the fact that more and more people from all walks of life are opening up the door of their home and saying, "Welcome to my home. Welcome to my piece of property. Welcome to a place where I can raise my family." There's nothing better than homeownership in America, and this administration is dedicated to make sure more and more people from all walks of life are able to open up the door where they live and say, "Come on in to my house.;As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we're also going to honor the strong tradition of service in the Hispanic community. Hispanic Americans have fought in every war since our founding. Forty-two Hispanic Americans have earned our Nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.;At this hour, men and women of Hispanic heritage are bringing freedom to people of other lands. They are laying the foundation of peace for generations to come. They are making sacrifices to bring justice to the terrorists and, at the same time, giving people a chance to live in a free society.;More than 127,000 Hispanic Americans wear the uniform of the United States of America. I'm proud to be their Commander in Chief, and I want to welcome those who wear the uniform to this event today. Thank you all for coming.;The strength of this country is the fact that every day, thousands of citizens, millions of citizens, volunteer to make somebody's life better. And that includes thousands and millions of Hispanic Americans who are volunteering in their community, people who use their time and their talent to make a difference in the lives of others, people who have heard the universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd like to be loved yourself.;In the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Hispanic groups around this country provided critical services and much-needed love to people whose lives were affected by those storms. In Texas, the League of United Latin American Citizens—we call them LULAC—served food at shelters and teamed up with the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to help people find housing as well. In Arizona, Latino groups sent truckloads of water and food and medical supplies to Mississippi. The National Council of La Raza established a relief fund to provide emergency financial aid and housing assistance to hurricane victims. Acts of generosity from Hispanic Americans gave many people a lot of hope, and our Nation honors the compassion of Latinos today in this celebration.;The President's Volunteer Service Award that I'm about to give to six citizens is the highest level of commendation a President can give in recognition of those who have contributed their time and energy to helping others.;Today I'm going to talk about—you'll hear the stories of six folks who have served as such a wonderful example. I mean, not only have these people helped somebody but they served as an example for others. They're true leaders in their own quiet way and their own humble way: Junior Salazar of Bradenton, Florida, Marie Arcos of Houston, Texas, Manuel Fonseca of Nashville, Tennessee, Elmer Carreno of Silver Spring, Maryland, Maria Hines of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and John Diaz of Crowley, Colorado.;Their efforts are helping children to learn to read, improving fire safety in schools and communities, and helping more Hispanics achieve the dream of a college education. In the wake of the hurricanes, they've helped set up emergency clinics, provided spiritual counseling to the displaced, just simple acts, such as reading stories to children whose families had lost their homes. Today we're here to honor your service, and we appreciate so very much what you have done to help lift the spirit of the country.;As we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we thank the Hispanic community that has helped build and shape our country in so many ways. America is a better place because of your contributions. I join all Americans in celebrating the accomplishments and wishing our Hispanic communities all across the country continued success.;I want to thank you all for coming. And now, I'm going to ask the military aide to please announce the Volunteer Service Awards. Y por fin, que Dios les bendiga.;[ At this point, Maj. Christian G. Cabaniss, USMC, Marine Corps Military Aide to the President, read the citations, and the President presented the medals. ];The President. I hope you can tell why I was so looking forward to this event. There's nothing like being able to thank six quiet heroes, helping to improve somebody's life, and at the same time, improving the spirit of the country. What a joyous occasion. Thank you all for coming. May God bless you all.</td></tr>

I'll answer a couple of questions in a second. I do want to say how pleased I am to be here in Argentina, advancing an agenda that is based upon my belief and our country's belief that there are certain universal values.;One of those values is that free societies are important to the progress of men and women, but free societies also require institutions that are solid and sound, institutions such as the right to worship freely, the right to write, say what you want in the press freely, the right to campaign and express your opinions freely. It's very important that there be solid rule of law and independent judiciary.;And so I'm pleased to be down here. It's a good place to spend Laura's birthday, which is today. I don't know if you knew that—no, I know you didn't, okay—but anyway, don't bring it up when you see her. [ Laughter ];But it's—I just had a meeting earlier with the Central American countries— young democracies, struggling to succeed, making good progress toward making sure institutions are well-rooted. I say Central American, plus Dominican Republic. And we talked about how pleased we were that we got the free trade agreement through, at least through the United States Congress. Most of the countries have ratified it. We're looking forward to implementing the trade agreement.;I had a good visit with President Kirchner. You know, Argentina is an amazing country. It's a vast land with a lot of natural resources. And he's done a very good job of helping to—helping this economy of theirs and their financial picture improve. And I congratulated him on it. We talked—well, you heard him, I'm not going to repeat what we talked about. We talked about a lot of subjects. It was a good, honest discussion.;And finally, I just met with our friends from the Andean nations. Good, young democracies, again struggling to fight narcotrafficking, and they were very interested in making sure that we didn't forget them and that we continued to pursue a free trade agreement. That was the main topic of discussion. All those countries recognize the importance of having a free trade agreement with the United States, and I assured them that our negotiators are negotiating in good faith and will continue to negotiate in good faith. That's what I've done so far today.;Nedra [Nedra Pickler, Associated Press].;CIA Employee's Identity Disclosure Investigation;Q. Hi, Mr. President. Thank you. Did Karl Rove tell you the truth about his role in the CIA leak case? And do you owe the American people an apology for your administration's assertations that Karl Rove and Scooter Libby weren't involved?;The President. We're going through a very serious investigation. And I will—I have told you before that I'm not going to discuss the investigation until it's completed. And we have got a—my obligation is to set an agenda, and I've done that. And the agenda is fighting and winning the war on terror and keeping the economic vitality and growth alive, dealing with the energy problem, nominating people to the Supreme Court that adhere to the philosophy that I can depend on—Judge Alito being such a person. I noticed today that they've got a date. I'm disappointed in the date but happy they do have a firm date for his confirmation hearing. We've got to recover from the hurricanes. So I've got a lot to do and will continue to focus on the people's business.;Steve [Steve Holland, Reuters].;Q. You've taken a beating in recent weeks, sir. What are you going to do for a fresh start? Are there going to be any staff changes? Would it help if the special prosecutor would wrap up his probe quickly?;The President. Well, again, you're trying to get me to comment on the investigation, which I'm not going to do. And I hope you understand this. It's a serious investigation, and it's an important investigation, but it's not yet over.;Again, I think it's important for the American people to know that I understand my job is to set clear goals and deal with the problems we face. Now, look, we've got an ongoing war on terror, and my administration is working with friends and allies to find these terrorists and bring them to justice before they strike us again. We're fighting the terrorists in Iraq. And as you know, we've got a two-pronged strategy, an important strategy, that one—on the one hand, has a political solution to it, on the other hand has a security solution to it. And we're working hard to achieve those objectives. We're laying what I have called the foundation for peace, because democratic nations don't war, democratic nations will be allies with each other in fighting off an ideology that is dark and grim in its vision and is willing to use murder as its tool.;Elisabeth [Elisabeth Bumiller, New York Times].;Q. Okay, this is not a question about the investigation, but it's about Karl.;The President. It sounds like one, though.;Q. Are there discussions in the White House about whether or not Karl will remain in his job?;The President. Elisabeth, the investigation on Karl, as you know, is not complete. And therefore, I will not comment upon— about him and/or the investigation. Again, I understand the anxiety and angst by the press corps to talk about this. On the other hand, it is a serious investigation, and we take it seriously, and we're cooperating to the extent that the special prosecutor wants us to cooperate.;President's Agenda;Q. The American people, though—sir, the American people, though, are beginning to question your honesty, according to the polls, 58 percent. And your approval rating is at an alltime low, primarily because, it seems, of this investigation. They are wondering whether you can keep on track and whether to believe you, sir.;The President. Well, no, I understand there is a preoccupation by polls by some. I think this may be—I think we've got— this is maybe the fourth or fifth consecutive semi-press conference—press conference or semi-press conference that I've been asked about polls. The way you earn credibility with the American people is to set a clear agenda that everybody can understand, an agenda that relates to their lives, and get the job done. And the agenda that I'm working on now is one that is important to the American people.;First of all is to protect our country, is to understand that we're at war with a radical ideology that wants to inflict harm on America and, at the same time, use that harm they inflict to achieve territorial ambition. I've talked a lot recently about the Zawahiri letter to Zarqawi, which is a clear statement of purpose by these terrorists. It should be viewed for what it is, a open warning to the free world that this is a very vital war, and we need to win it. So I spend a lot of time talking about that— and more than talking about it, acting on it.;Secondly, you know, our economy has shown amazing resilience in the face of natural disaster, as well as rising energy prices. But we've got to have policies in place that make it possible for the economy to continue to grow. You know, we're down here talking about trade. It's hard to trade with somebody if they're broke. And I've told our partners that we've got good economic growth now.;But what we need to do is to work with Congress to make sure that we deal with the energy crisis. What can we do to deal with the energy crisis? Well, we can expand refinery capacity in the United States. I mean, it should be apparent to the Members of Congress that when the—Katrina hit, there was massive disruptions of our own capacity to make gasoline, which put us in a precarious position for the consumers, which would affect the economy, by the way. And so we'll be talking to Congress about a further energy initiative to make sure we've got economic growth. We've obviously got work to do with Katrina and Rita, the damage from those hurricanes.;And I mentioned the Supreme Court. This is a very vital issue for the United States Senate and for the country. Sam Alito, Jr., is an incredibly intelligent, well-qualified person who should be on the Court. I told the leadership I thought it would be best to have the hearings before Christmas. They didn't feel like they could get the job done. I talked to Chairman Specter, and the reason why, at least he explained to me, that he couldn't get the hearings done before Christmas is because Alito had written so many opinions, and he wanted to make sure he had time to read them. And they made that decision. Fortunately, there is a firm date, and we look forward to working on that date.;And finally, an issue that is of concern to the American people is the border— is border security. I signed an appropriations bill for border security and during that signature ceremony talked about our strategy to use technology and border patrol and wise policies to do our job, which is to prevent people from illegally—not only people but, by the way, contraband, guns and drugs—from coming into our country illegally. And so that's the agenda before us, and that's the agenda that I will continue to work on.;One more. Yes, Matt [Matt Cooper, Time].;President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela;Q. Mr. President, you're likely to cross paths with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at this summit. How should Americans think about this President, who has said many hostile things about you and your administration? Do you think of him as another Castro? And if you see him this afternoon, do you have any words for him?;The President. Well, I will, of course, be polite. That's what the American people expect their President to do, is to be a polite person. And I will—if I run across him, I will do just that. My attitude toward any leader—toward leaders, and I judge leaders based upon their willingness to protect institutions that will—for a viable democratic society. And to the extent that any leader undermines the free press, we will speak out. To the extent that any leader makes it difficult to worship freely, we will make our positions known. To the extent that the judiciary is not an independent organization—in other words, to the extent that there's not proper checks and balances, we will express our positions.;And there's ways to do so. We can do so through our embassies. We can do so in forums—not necessarily singling out a particular country or person but talking on the positive about how important it is to have checks and balances in society, about how important it is to have these institutions so that a single person cannot become the ruler of all people. I will remind people today at this important summit that—as we talk about poverty and minority rights, which is of concern to many countries here, that one—such concerns are our concerns, and that if you're interested in minority rights, the best way to allow minorities to have rights is in a democratic society, where the people actually make the decisions for government.;And so it's a—I think this is a good forum and a good opportunity to express— for me to express our country's values. But they're not American values, I keep telling you, these are universal values that are true. That's why my meeting with President Kirchner was—one of the reasons it was so positive is because Argentina shares the same values that America shares. They've been through some difficult experiences and making sure that those values are rooted in their societies. Of course I've reminded others, we went through difficult experiences in the past. And we had a Constitution that said everybody is free, but they weren't.;And so it's a—so what I'll search for in the world, as I think about world leaders, is that commitment, firm commitment to values and institutions that make democracy viable.;Thank you all very much. Thanks.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks on Democracy in the Americas in Brasilia</td><td class="c6">November 6, 2005</td><td class="c7">Thank you. Boa tarde. Thank you for coming. This is my first trip to Brazil, and Laura and I are really pleased to be here in your capital city. We've had a magnificent stay, had a great visit with President Lula. It's an important visit because Brazil and the United States are close friends. And that's the way it should be. Plus the President and the First Lady gave us an unbelievably good barbeque. [ Laughter ] I also commend the President for his commitment to improving the lives of the people here in Brazil.;Our two nations share many things in common. We are both children of the New World, founded in empire and fulfilled in independence. We're united by history and geography. We share the conviction that the future of our hemisphere must be a future of justice and freedom.;Only a generation ago, this was a continent plagued by military dictatorship and civil war. Yet the people of this continent defied the dictators, and they claimed their liberty. We saw the dramatic evidence at the Summit of the Americas that President Lula and I just attended. The delegates from 34 countries that came to this conference all represent democratic governments.;Freedom is the gift of the Almighty to every man and woman in this world, and today, this vision is the free consensus of a free Americas. It is a vision that is written into the founding document of the Organization of American States, which calls this hemisphere—calls on the hemisphere "to offer to man a land of liberty and a favorable environment for the realization of his just aspirations." It is the vision that is given clear direction in the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which declares, "The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it." And it is a vision that puts what was once a distant dream within our reach, an Americas wholly free and democratic and at peace with ourselves and our neighbors.;As the largest democracy in South America, Brazil is a leader, and today, Brazil is exercising its leadership across the globe. In Africa, Brazil is working to defeat the scourge of HIV/AIDS by partnering with America to improve treatment and care and prevention in Portuguese-speaking nations like Mozambique. In this hemisphere, Brazil leads the coalition of the United Nations peacekeeping forces who are helping to restore peace and stability in Haiti. And here at home, Brazil aspires to set an example for the continent by building a just social order where the blessings of liberty are enjoyed by every citizen of this great nation.;Ensuring social justice for the Americas requires choosing between two competing visions. One offers a vision of hope. It is founded on representative government, integration into the world community, and a faith in the transformative power of freedom in individual lives. The other seeks to roll back the democratic progress of the past two decades by playing to fear, pitting neighbor against neighbor, and blaming others for their own failures to provide for their people. The choices we make will determine which vision will define the Americas our children inherit, and we must make tough decisions today to ensure a better tomorrow.;As you work for a better tomorrow, Brazil must know you have a strong partner in the United States. Like you, we aspire for a hemisphere where the dignity of every human being is respected. Like you, we believe that the poor and disenfranchised have a special claim on our attention. And like you, we know that we must make good on the promises of democracy. In the Americas of the 21st century, freedom is the gateway to social justice, and democracies old and new must work together to build a hemisphere that delivers hope and opportunity for every citizen.;Our common ideal of social justice begins with self-government. The promise of democracy starts with national pride and independence and elections, but it does not end there. A country that divides into factions and dwells on old grievances cannot move forward and risks sliding back into tyranny. A country that unites all its people behind common ideals will multiply in strength and confidence. The successful democracies of the 21st century will not be defined by blood and soil. Successful democracies will be defined by a broader ideal of citizenship, based on shared principles and shared responsibilities and respect for all.;For my own country, the process of becoming a mature, multiethnic democracy was lengthy. My country's journey from national independence to equal justice for all meant overcoming the enslavement of millions and a 4-year civil war. Even after slavery ended, a century passed before the guarantee of equal rights under the law was finally made real. Racial division almost destroyed my country, and the citizens of the United States learned the false doctrine of "separate but equal" was no basis for a strong and unified America. The only way my country found to rise above the injustices of our history was to reject segregation, to move beyond mere tolerance, and to affirm the brotherhood of all people in our land.;Each democracy has its own character and culture that reflect its unique traditions and history. Yet all free and successful countries share some common characteristics: Freedom to worship, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, economic liberty, equal justice under the rule of law, equal citizenship for all, and the limitation of state power through checks and balances. In many parts of our hemisphere, these institutions of a free society are still young, and they are fragile, and we must ensure that they are strong for the tasks ahead. To deliver justice, the people must have confidence in their institutions, and we must replace the rule of man with the rule of law.;Some today suggest that democracy has outlived its usefulness. They have misread history. The Americas has declared democracy indispensable for the exercise of human rights. It is the only region in the world that imposes an obligation to defend democracy. For all the growing pains, it is a miracle of history that this young century finds us speaking about the consolidation of freedom throughout our hemisphere. We must continue our work to help strengthen the institutions of liberty because we know that freedom is the only way to ensure that our citizens can lead lives of purpose and dignity. And without democracy there can be no social justice, because only democracy offers a place at the table for every member of society.;Our common ideal of social justice must include a better life for all our citizens. As elections and democracies have spread across our hemisphere, we see a revolution in expectations. In free societies, citizens will rightly insist that people should not go hungry, that every child deserves the opportunity for a decent education, and that hard work and initiative should be rewarded. And with each new generation that grows up in freedom and democracy, these expectations rise and the demands for accountability grow. Either democracies will meet these legitimate demands, or we will yield the future to the enemies of freedom.;The nations of this hemisphere have a moral obligation to help others. They have a moral obligation to educate their children and to provide decent health care. We have a moral duty to make sure our actions are effective. At Monterrey in 2002, the world agreed to a new vision for the way we fight poverty and curb corruption and provide aid in this new millennium. Developing countries agreed to take responsibility for their own economic progress through good governance and sound practices and the rule of law, and developed countries agreed to support these efforts.;My country has sought to implement the Monterrey consensus by changing the way we deliver aid. We have established a new Millennium Challenge Account that increases aid for nations that govern justly, that invest in the education and health of their people, and promote economic freedom. Recently we signed compacts delivering aid—Millennium Challenge aid to Honduras and Nicaragua. This new aid will help those countries improve their roads and diversify their crops and strengthen property rights and make their rural businesses more competitive. And in the years ahead, under the leadership of Ambassador Danilovich, we hope more countries will follow their example.;My country has also stepped up to meet the humanitarian challenges facing our region and the world by providing millions of dollars bilaterally, especially for education of the children. We understand that you cannot achieve economic prosperity and social justice without educating the children of a country. We also support the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, to provide care and prevention and support for those suffering from the pandemic. At the 2004 special summit in Mexico, the leaders of our hemisphere, including President Lula and me, made a commitment to provide lifesaving treatment for at least 600,000 individuals by the next Summit of the Americas. We worked together. We have shown our words are not empty promises. We have helped deliver treatment to more than 670,000 people in this hemisphere, which surpasses our goal of helping those with HIV/AIDS. And there is more work to be done.;As we expand and improve aid, we are also working to improve the Inter-American Development Bank. Since it was established, this bank has played a major role in the economic development of Latin America and the Caribbean. But as the economies of the Americas further develop, the bank has to change with them. The beginning of President Moreno's tenure gives us a great opportunity to modernize the bank by taking better advantage of global capital markets and by tailoring the bank's programs to the real needs of the growing economies on this continent. The private sector is the engine of growth and job creation in this region. The bank must greatly strengthen its role in private sector investment, especially in small businesses, which are the backbone of a healthy and growing economy. I have asked the United States Treasury Secretary John Snow to work with his counterparts in the hemisphere and at the bank to implement reforms that will ensure that the bank better addresses the needs for economic growth and job creation. They will also discuss a range of options, including giving grants and debt relief for the poorest of nations.;Increasing aid and relieving debt are important parts of our efforts to lift the burden of poverty from places of suffering, yet they are not enough. Our goal is to promote opportunity for people throughout the Americas, whether you live in Minnesota or Brazil. And the best way to do this is by expanding free and fair trade.;The United States, Mexico, and Canada took a first step with what's called NAFTA. And trade between our countries has tripled in 10-year period. Our hemisphere has sought to build on this example by committing ourselves to the Free Trade of the Americas that would eliminate barriers across the entire hemisphere, and I appreciate President Lula's discussion with me today about working to see if we can't make that become a reality. The United States has also made substantial advances toward the goal of hemispheric free trade through bilateral trade agreements with partners such as Chile. And 3 months ago, we passed through our Congress a trade agreement with the nations of Central America and the Dominican Republic that gives the people of that region jobs and opportunities that come with freer trade and more investment.;And at this moment, we're working hard to advance negotiations with the Andean countries and Panama. By working for free and—I repeat—fair trade across this hemisphere, we will bring all our people into the expanding circle of development. We'll make it easier for those of us who live in this hemisphere to compete with countries like China and India. But most importantly, trade means jobs for people.;The best opportunity to deliver the blessings of trade to every citizen in this hemisphere is the Doha round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization. A successful Doha round will open up markets for farm products and services and industrial goods across this hemisphere and across the globe. Under Doha, every nation will gain, and the developing world stands to gain the most. The World Bank estimates that if the Doha round passes, 300 million people will be lifted from poverty. We know that from history that developing nations that open themselves up to trade grow at several times the rate of countries that practice protectionism. And the stakes are high—they're really high. The lives and futures of millions of poor people across the globe hang in the balance, and so we must bring the Doha trade talks to a successful conclusion.;The greatest obstacles to a successful Doha round are the countries that stand firm in the way of dismantling the tariffs and barriers and trade-distorting subsidies that isolate the poor on this continent from the great opportunities of the 21st century. Only an ambitious reform agenda in agriculture and manufactured goods and services can ensure that the benefits of free and fair trade are enjoyed by all people in all countries.;We agree with Brazil that the agricultural negotiations will unlock the full potential of the Doha round. Your President has criticized the agricultural subsidies that the developed world pays to its farmers, trade-distorting subsidies that undercut honest farmers in the developing world. I agree with President Lula, and the United States is leading the way to address this problem.;My administration has offered a bold proposal for Doha that would substantially reduce agricultural tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies, in a first stage, and over a period of 15 years, eliminate them altogether. Leaders who are concerned about the harmful effects of high tariffs and farm subsidies must move the Doha round forward. And leaders who want to make progress on agricultural subsidies must use their influence to help the WTO make progress on all aspects of the Doha round. By completing Doha, we will help build an Americas that lives in liberty, trades in freedom, and grows in prosperity.;Finally, our common ideal is—of social justice requires safety and security for all our citizens. In many parts of this hemisphere, drug lords and terrorists and criminal gangs corrupt democratic societies. When these groups are more powerful than the state, there can be no social justice. So the United States is working with affected countries to restore the rule of law and ensure the safety of ordinary citizens. We are working with the Government of Mexico to stop the smugglers who traffic in everything from guns to human beings. We are helping President Uribe and the Colombian people defeat the cocaine cartels and narcoterrorists. We're providing money to help honest farmers grow legitimate crops. We're working with our partners in this region to stop terrorist organizations from using this hemisphere as a base to launder money and to provide support for their operations across the globe.;By protecting the people of the Americas from those who operate outside the law, we strengthen democracy, we promote social justice, and we make prosperity more likely. Citizens who live in fear for their lives because of drug lords and terrorists and criminal gangs are not free citizens. So we must continue to work for the day that all citizens can count on their governments to protect them from criminals and advance the peace and stability that can only come from freedom.;In the last half-century, the nations of the Americas have overcome enormous challenges, colonialism and communism and military dictatorship. The progress we have achieved is the result of tremendous sacrifice and leadership. One such leader was the man who built this beautiful capital as the symbol of Brazilian democracy. President Kubitschek was forced into exile when antidemocratic forces seized control in Brazil. His dream, he said, was to live and die in a free country. At the start of this hopeful new century, the dream of this proud patriot inspires citizens not only in this country but all around the continent.;The citizens of the Americas look to us, the elected leaders, to make his dream a reality and to lead by example. Governments across this hemisphere must be strong, must listen to the people, and must not squander their money. Governments across this hemisphere must be free of corruption. Governments across this hemisphere must be accountable, and we must live by the same standard we set for others. By making the blessings of freedom real in our hemisphere, we will advance the cause of social justice and set a shining example for the rest of the world.;Thank you for allowing me to come and address you. May God bless Brazil. May God continue to bless our Nation, America. Thank you.</td></tr>

Bush: Proclamation 7961 - National Farm-City Week, 2005</td><td class="c6">November 15, 2005</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;Farming is America's first industry, and the success of America's farmers and ranchers is crucial to the prosperity of our country. During National Farm-City Week, we recognize the important relationship between rural and urban industries that helps keep our farmers and our Nation strong.;America's farmers and ranchers work hard, and they provide a healthy, safe, and abundant food supply for our citizens and for countless individuals abroad. In order to make their goods available to the public, they depend on partnerships with processors, transporters, marketers, distributors, and many others. These cooperative networks make up America's robust agricultural industry and account for about one-sixth of all jobs in the United States.;My Administration understands that our farm economy is a source of strength for our Nation, and we remain committed to advancing policies that will improve our country's agricultural industry. We have successfully implemented the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which significantly increased conservation funding and provided an important safety net for our farmers. Earlier this year, I signed the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement, which will help ensure that free trade is fair trade and level the playing field for American products exported to Central America. To continue to open new markets for America's farmers and ranchers, we must also work for a free and fair global trading system. Through the World Trade Organization's Doha Round of trade negotiations, we are seeking to reduce and eliminate tariffs and other barriers to U.S. agricultural goods.;As we celebrate National Farm-City Week, we express appreciation for those who make a living off the land. Their hard work and dedication to maintaining strong networks between rural areas and urban communities helps to feed, clothe, and provide energy for Americans and others around the world.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 18 through November 24, 2005, as National Farm-City Week. I encourage all Americans to join in recognizing the great accomplishments of our farmers and ranchers and the entrepreneurship and ingenuity of countless others who produce America's agricultural goods.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.;GEORGE W. BUSH</td></tr>

Bush: The President's News Conference</td><td class="c6">December 19, 2005</td><td class="c7">The President. Welcome. Please be seated. Thanks.;Last night I addressed the Nation about our strategy for victory in Iraq and the historic elections that took place in the country last week. In a nation that once lived by the whims of a brutal dictator, the Iraqi people now enjoy constitutionally protected freedoms, and their leaders now derive their powers from the consent of the governed. Millions of Iraqis are looking forward to a future with hope and optimism.;The Iraqi people still face many challenges. This is the first time the Iraqis are forming a Government under their new Constitution. The Iraqi Constitution requires a two-thirds vote of the Parliament for certain top officials, so the formation of the new Government will take time as Iraqis work to build consensus. And once the new Iraqi Government assumes office, Iraq's new leaders will face many important decisions on issues such as security and reconstruction, economic reform, and national unity. The work ahead will require the patience of the Iraqi people and the patience and support of America and our coalition partners.;As I said last night, this election does not mean the end of violence, but it is the beginning of something new, a constitutional democracy at the heart of the Middle East. And we will keep working toward our goal of a democratic Iraq that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself.;Our mission in Iraq is critical to victory in the global war on terror. After our country was attacked on September the 11th and nearly 3,000 lives were lost, I vowed to do everything within my power to bring justice to those who were responsible. I also pledged to the American people to do everything within my power to prevent this from happening again. What we quickly learned was that Al Qaida was not a conventional enemy. Some lived in our cities and communities and communicated from here in America to plot and plan with bin Laden's lieutenants in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere. Then they boarded our airplanes and launched the worst attack on our country in our Nation's history.;This new threat required us to think and act differently. And as the 9/11 Commission pointed out, to prevent this from happening again, we need to connect the dots before the enemy attacks, not after. And we need to recognize that dealing with Al Qaida is not simply a matter of law enforcement, it requires defending the country against an enemy that declared war against the United States of America.;As President and Commander in Chief, I have the constitutional responsibility and the constitutional authority to protect our country. Article II of the Constitution gives me that responsibility and the authority necessary to fulfill it. And after September the 11th, the United States Congress also granted me additional authority to use military force against Al Qaida.;After September the 11th, one question my administration had to answer was how, using the authorities I have, how do we effectively detect enemies hiding in our midst and prevent them from striking us again? We know that a 2-minute phone conversation between somebody linked to Al Qaida here and an operative overseas could lead directly to the loss of thousands of lives. To save American lives, we must be able to act fast and to detect these conversations so we can prevent new attacks.;So, consistent with U.S. law and the Constitution, I authorized the interception of international communications of people with known links to Al Qaida and related terrorist organizations. This program is carefully reviewed approximately every 45 days to ensure it is being used properly. Leaders in the United States Congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this program. And it has been effective in disrupting the enemy while safeguarding our civil liberties.;This program has targeted those with known links to Al Qaida. I've reauthorized this program more than 30 times since the September the 11th attacks, and I intend to do so for so long as our Nation is— for so long as the Nation faces the continuing threat of an enemy that wants to kill American citizens.;Another vital tool in the war on terror is the PATRIOT Act. After September the 11th, Congress acted quickly and responsibly by passing this law, which provides our law enforcement and intelligence community key tools to prevent attacks in our country. The PATRIOT Act tore down the legal and bureaucratic wall that kept law enforcement and intelligence authorities from sharing vital information about terrorist threats. It allows Federal investigators to pursue terrorists with tools already used against other types of criminals. America's law enforcement personnel have used this critical tool to prosecute terrorist operatives and their supporters and to breakup cells here in America.;Yet key provisions of this law are set to expire in 12 days. The House of Representatives voted for reauthorization, but last week, a minority of Senators filibustered the PATRIOT Act, blocking the Senate from voting to reauthorize key provisions of this vital law. In fact, the Senate Democratic leader boasted to a group of political supporters that the Senate Democrats had "killed the PATRIOT Act." Most of the Senators now filibustering the PATRIOT Act actually voted for it in 2001. These Senators need to explain why they thought the PATRIOT Act was a vital tool after the September the 11th attacks but now think it's no longer necessary.;The terrorists want to strike America again, and they hope to inflict even greater damage than they did on September the 11th. Congress has a responsibility to give our law enforcement and intelligence officials the tools they need to protect the American people. The Senators who are filibustering the PATRIOT Act must stop their delaying tactics, and the Senate must vote to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. In the war on terror, we cannot afford to be without this law for a single moment.;As we fight the war on terror, we'll also continue to work to build prosperity for our citizens. Because we cut taxes and restrained nonsecurity spending, our economy is strong, and it is getting stronger. We added 215,000 new jobs in November. We've added nearly 4.5 million new jobs since May of 2003. The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent, lower than the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Despite hurricanes and high gas prices, third-quarter growth was 4.3 percent. More Americans own their own homes than at any time in our history. Inflation is low. Productivity is high, and consumer confidence is up. We're heading into a new year with an economy that is the envy of the world, and we have every reason to be optimistic about our economic future.;We made other important progress this year on the priorities of American families. We passed a good energy bill, and we're putting America on the path to make our economy less dependent on foreign sources of oil. We were wise with taxpayers' money and cut nonsecurity discretionary spending below last year's level. We passed the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement to open up markets and help level the playing field for America's workers and farmers and small businesses. We passed bankruptcy reform and class-action lawsuit reform. I appointed John Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. Chief Justice Roberts is poised to lead the Supreme Court with integrity and prudence for decades to come.;We've got more work to do in this coming year. To keep our economy growing, we need to keep taxes low and make the tax relief permanent. We must restrain Government spending, and I'm pleased that the House today has voted to rein in entitlement spending by $40 billion, and I urge the United States Senate to join them. We must reduce junk lawsuits and strengthen our education system and give more Americans the ability to obtain affordable health insurance. We must pass comprehensive immigration reform that protects our borders, strengthens enforcement, and creates a new temporary-worker program that relieves pressure on the border but rejects amnesty.;I look forward to the Senate holding an up-or-down vote on Judge Sam Alito and confirming him by January 20th as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Judge Alito has more prior judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. He's a highly respected and principled jurist, and he will make our Nation proud as a member of the High Court.;As we prepare to spend time with our families this holiday season, we also stop to count our blessings. We're thankful for our courageous men and women in uniform who are spending the holidays away from loved ones, standing watch for liberty in distant lands. We give thanks for our military families who love and support them in their vital work and who also serve our country. And we pray for the families of the fallen heroes. We hold them in our hearts and we lift them up in our prayers and we pledge that the sacrifice of their loved ones will never be forgotten.;I'll be glad to answer some questions here, starting with you, Terry [Terence Hunt, Associated Press].;Investigation of Leaks/Judicial Safeguards on Wiretaps;Q. Thank you, sir. Are you going to order a leaks investigation into the disclosure of the NSA surveillance program? And why did you skip the basic safeguard of asking courts for permission for these intercepts?;The President. Let me start with the first question. There is a process that goes on inside the Justice Department about leaks, and I presume that process is moving forward. My personal opinion is it was a shameful act for someone to disclose this very important program in a time of war. The fact that we're discussing this program is helping the enemy.;You've got to understand—and I hope the American people understand—there is still an enemy that would like to strike the United States of America, and they're very dangerous. And the discussion about how we try to find them will enable them to adjust. Now, I can understand you asking these questions, and if I were you, I'd be asking me these questions too. But it is a shameful act by somebody who has got secrets of the United States Government and feels like they need to disclose them publicly.;Let me give you an example about my concerns about letting the enemy know what may or may not be happening. In the late 1990s, our Government was following Usama bin Laden because he was using a certain type of telephone. And then the fact that we were following Usama bin Laden because he was using a certain type of telephone made it into the press as the result of a leak. And guess what happened? Saddam—Usama bin Laden changed his behavior. He began to change how he communicated.;We're at war, and we must protect America's secrets. And so the Justice Department, I presume, will proceed forward with a full investigation. I haven't ordered one, because I understand there's kind of a natural progression that will take place when this kind of leak emerges.;The second part of the question is? Sorry, I gave a long answer.;Q. It was, why did you skip the basic safeguards of asking courts for permission for the intercepts?;The President. First of all, I—right after September the 11th, I knew we were fighting a different kind of war. And so I asked people in my administration to analyze how best for me and our Government to do the job people expect us to do, which is to detect and prevent a possible attack. That's what the American people want. We looked at the possible scenarios. And the people responsible for helping us protect and defend came forth with the current program, because it enables us to move faster and quicker. And that's important. We've got to be fast on our feet, quick to detect and prevent.;We use FISA still—you're referring to the FISA court in your question—of course we use FISAs. But FISA is for long-term monitoring. What is needed in order to protect the American people is the ability to move quickly to detect.;Now, having suggested this idea, I then, obviously, went to the question, is it legal to do so? I am—I swore to uphold the laws. Do I have the legal authority to do this? And the answer is, absolutely. As I mentioned in my remarks, the legal authority is derived from the Constitution as well as the authorization of force by the United States Congress.;Adam [Adam Entous, Reuters].;Iraqi Elections and Constitution;Q. Mr. President, you have hailed the Iraqi elections as a success, but some lawmakers say you are not focusing on the threat of civil war. Do you fear a civil war? And how hard will you push Iraq's competing political parties to get a Government and a constitutional compromise?;The President. I appreciate that. We look at all contingencies, but my optimism about a unified Iraq moving forward was confirmed when over 10 million people went to the polls under a—and voted for a Government under the new Constitution. Constitutions tend to bind societies.;Now, there are some things we've got to watch, Adam, for certain. One, is we've got to help the Iraqi Government as best as they need help, to stand up a Government as quickly as possible. In other words, we're urging them: Don't delay, move as quickly as you can, solve the—get the political parties—once the vote is completed, get the political parties together and come up with a Government.;And it's going to take awhile, because, first of all, the ballots won't be fully counted, I guess, until early January. And then, as I mentioned in my remarks, it takes a two-thirds vote to—first, to seat certain officials. Sometimes it's hard to achieve a two-thirds vote in legislative bodies. How about the Senate, for example? [ Laughter ] But nevertheless, it's going to take awhile. And the American people have got to understand that we think in terms of elections, most of our elections end the day after the election. Sometimes they don't, Adam. [ Laughter ] And so you're going to see a lot of give-and-take, and it's important for us to get this process moving forward.;Secondly, there is an opportunity to amend the Constitution. You remember that was part of the deal with the Iraqis in order to get this process moving. And we'll want to make sure we're monitoring and involved with that part. In other words, involvement doesn't mean telling the sovereign Government what to do. Involvement means giving advice as to how to move forward so a country becomes more unified. And I'm very optimistic about the way forward for the Iraqi people.;And the reason why is based upon the fact that the Iraqis have shown incredible courage. Think about what has happened in a brief period of time—relatively brief. I know with all the TV stations and stuff in America, 2 1/2 years seems like an eternity. But in the march of history, it's not all that long. They have gone from tyranny to an amazing election last December. If I'd have stood up here a year ago, in one of my many press conferences, and told you that in the—"Next year I make this prediction to you: That over 10 million Iraqis, including many Sunnis, will vote for a permanent Government," I think you probably would have said, "There he goes again.;But it happened. And it happened because the Iraqis want to live in a free society. And what's important about this election is that Iraq will become an ally in the war on terror, and Iraq will serve as a beacon for what is possible, a beacon of freedom in a part of the world that is desperate for freedom and liberty. And as I say in my speeches, a free Iraq will serve as such an optimistic and hopeful example for reformers from Tehran to Damascus. And that's an important part of a strategy to help lay the foundation of peace for generations.;John [John Roberts, CBS News].;President's Decision on Iraq;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. So many questions, so little time.;The President. Well, keep your question short, then. [ Laughter ];Q. I'll do my best, sir. But sir, you've shown a remarkable spirit of candor in the last couple of weeks in your conversation and speeches about Iraq. And I'm wondering if, in that spirit, I might ask you a question that you didn't seem to have an answer for the last time you were asked, and that is, what would you say is the biggest mistake you've made during your Presidency, and what have you learned from it?;The President. Answering Dickerson's [John Dickerson, TIME] question. No, I— the last time those questions were asked, I really felt like it was an attempt for me to say it was a mistake to go into Iraq. And it wasn't a mistake to go into Iraq. It was the right decision to make.;I think that, John, there's going to be a lot of analysis done on the decisions on the ground in Iraq. For example, I'm fully aware that some have said it was a mistake not to put enough troops there immediately—or more troops. I made my decision based upon the recommendations of Tommy Franks, and I still think it was the right decision to make. But history will judge.;I said the other day that a mistake was trying to train a civilian defense force and an Iraqi army at the same time but not giving the civilian defense force enough training and tools necessary to be able to battle a group of thugs and killers. And so we adjusted.;And the point I'm trying to make to the American people in this, as you said, candid dialog—I hope I've been candid all along, but in the candid dialog—is to say, we're constantly changing our tactics to meet the changing tactics of an enemy. And that's important for our citizens to understand.;Thank you. Kelly [Kelly Wallace, Cable News Network].;Open Dialog on Wiretaps;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. If you believe that present law needs to be faster, more agile, concerning the surveillance of conversations from someone in the United States to somewhere outside the country——;The President. Right.;Q. ——why, in the 4 years since 9/11, has your administration not sought to get changes in the law instead of bypassing it, as some of your critics have said?;The President. No, I appreciate that. First, I want to make clear to the people listening that this program is limited in nature to those that are known Al Qaida ties and/or affiliates. That's important. So it's a program that's limited, and you brought up something that I want to stress, and that is, is that these calls are not intercepted within the country. They are from outside the country to in the country or vice versa. So in other words, this is not a—if you're calling from Houston to L.A., that call is not monitored. And if there was ever any need to monitor, there would be a process to do that.;I think I've got the authority to move forward, Kelly. I mean, this is what it's— and the Attorney General was out briefing this morning and I—about why it's legal to make the decisions I'm making. I can fully understand why Members of Congress are expressing concerns about civil liberties. I know that. And it's—I share the same concerns. I want to make sure the American people understand, however, that we have an obligation to protect you, and we're doing that and, at the same time, protecting your civil liberties.;Secondly, an open debate about law would say to the enemy, "Here's what we're going to do." And this is an enemy which adjusts. We monitor this program carefully. We have consulted with Members of the Congress over a dozen times. We are constantly reviewing the program. Those of us who review the program have a duty to uphold the laws of the United States, and we take that duty very seriously.;Let's see here—Martha [Martha Raddatz, ABC News]—working my way around the electronic media, here.;Domestic Wiretaps;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You say you have an obligation to protect us. Then why not monitor those calls between Houston and L.A.? If the threat is so great, and you use the same logic, why not monitor those calls? Americans thought they weren't being spied on in calls overseas— why not within the country, if the threat is so great?;The President. We will, under current law, if we have to. We will monitor those calls. And that's why there is a FISA law. We will apply for the right to do so. And there's a difference—let me finish—there is a difference between detecting, so we can prevent, and monitoring. And it's important to know the distinction between the two.;Q. But preventing is one thing, and you said the FISA laws essentially don't work because of the speed in monitoring calls overseas.;The President. I said we use the FISA courts to monitor calls. It's a very important tool, and we do use it. I just want to make sure we've got all tools at our disposal. This is an enemy which is quick, and it's lethal. And sometimes we have to move very, very quickly. But if there is a need based upon evidence, we will take that evidence to a court in order to be able to monitor calls within the United States.;Who haven't I called on, let's see here. Suzanne [Suzanne Malveaux, Cable News Network].;Congressional Oversight;Q. Democrats have said that you have acted beyond the law and that you have even broken the law. There are some Republicans who are calling for congressional hearings and even an independent investigation. Are you willing to go before Members of Congress and explain this eavesdropping program? And do you support an independent investigation?;The President. We have been talking to Members of the United States Congress. We have met with them over 12 times. And it's important for them to be brought into this process. Again, I repeat, I understand people's concerns. But I also want to assure the American people that I am doing what you expect me to do, which is to safeguard civil liberties and, at the same time, protect the United States of America. And we've explained the authorities under which I'm making our decisions and will continue to do so.;Secondly, there is a committee—two committees on the Hill which are responsible, and that's the Intelligence Committee. Again, any public hearings on programs will say to the enemy, here's what they do, adjust. This is a war. Of course we consult with Congress and have been consulting with Congress and will continue to do so.;Wendell [Wendell Goler, FOX News Channel]. You got a little problem there, Wendell? [ Laughter ];Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction/Iraq;Q. I'm caught, Mr. President.;The President. Oh, you're caught. [ Laughter ] Well, liberate him. [ Laughter ];Q. You've talked about your decision to go to war and the bad intelligence, and you've carefully separated the intelligence from the decision, saying that it was the right decision to go to war despite the problems with the intelligence, sir. But with respect, the intelligence helped you build public support for the war. And so I wonder if now, as you look back, if you look at that intelligence and feel that the intelligence and your use of it might bear some responsibility for the current divisions in the country over the war, and what can you do about it, sir?;The President. No, I appreciate that. First of all, I can understand why people were—well, wait a minute. Everybody thought there was weapons of mass destruction, and there weren't any. I felt the same way. We looked at the intelligence and felt certain that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Intelligence agencies around the world felt the same way, by the way. Members of the United States Congress looked at the National Intelligence Estimate—same intelligence estimate I looked at—and came to the same conclusion, Wendell.;So in other words, there was universal— there was a universal feeling that he had weapons of mass destruction. As a matter of fact, it was so universal that the United Nations Security Council passed numerous resolutions. And so when the weapons weren't there, like many Americans, I was concerned and wondered why. That's why we set up the Silberman-Robb Commission to address intelligence shortfalls, to hopefully see to it that this kind of situation didn't arise.;Now, having said all that, what we did find after the war was that Saddam Hussein had the desire to—or the liberation—Saddam had the desire to reconstitute his weapons programs. In other words, he had the capacity to reconstitute them. America was still his enemy. And of course, he manipulated the Oil-for-Food Programme in the hopes of ending sanctions. In our view, he was just waiting for the world to turn its head, to look away, in order to reconstitute the programs. He was dangerous then. It's the right decision to have removed Sad-dam.;Now, the American people—I will continue to speak to the American people on this issue, to not only describe the decision-making process but also the way forward. I gave a speech prior to the liberation of Iraq, when I talked about a broader strategic objective, which is the establishment of democracy. And I've talked about democracy in Iraq. Certainly it's not the only rationale, I'm not claiming that. But I also want you to review that speech so that you get a sense for not only the desire to remove a threat, but also the desire to help establish democracy. And the amazing thing about—in Iraq, as a part of a broader strategy to help what I call, "lay the foundation of peace," democracies don't war, democracies are peaceful countries.;And what you're seeing now is an historic moment, because I believe democracies will spread. I believe when people get the taste for freedom or see a neighbor with a taste for freedom, they will demand the same thing, because I believe in the universality of freedom. I believe everybody has the desire to be free. I recognize some don't believe that, which basically condemns some to tyranny. I strongly believe that deep in everybody's soul is the desire to live in liberty, and if given a chance, they will choose that path. And it's not easy to do that. The other day, I gave a speech and talked about how our road to our Constitution, which got amended shortly after it was approved, was pretty bumpy. We tried the Articles of Confederation. It didn't work. There was a lot of, kind of, civil unrest. But nevertheless, in that—deep in the soul is the desire to live in liberty, people—make the—have got the patience and the steadfastness to achieve that objective. And that is what we're seeing in Iraq.;And it's not going to be easy. It's still going to be hard, because we're getting rid of decades of bitterness. If you're a—you know, you find these secret prisons where people have been tortured, that's unacceptable. And yet there are some who still want to have retribution against people who harmed them.;Now, I'll tell you an amazing story, at least I thought it was amazing. We had people—first-time voters, or voters in the Iraqi election, come in to see me in the Oval. They had just voted that day, and they came in. It was exciting to talk to people. And one person said, "How come you're giving Saddam Hussein a trial?" I said, "First of all, it's your Government, not ours." She said, "He doesn't deserve a trial. He deserves immediate death for what he did to my people." And it just struck me about how strongly she felt about the need to not have a rule of law, that there needed to be quick retribution, that he didn't deserve it. And I said to her, "Don't you see that the trial itself stands in such contrast to the tyrant that that in itself is a victory for freedom and a defeat for tyranny," just the trial alone. And it's important that there be rule of law.;My only point to you is there's a lot of work to get rid of the past, yet we're headed in the right direction. And it's an exciting moment in history.;Stretch [Richard Keil, Bloomberg News].;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Getting back to the domestic spying issue for a moment. According to FISA's own records, it's received nearly 19,000 requests for wiretaps or search warrants since 1979, rejected just five of them. It also operates in secret, so security shouldn't be a concern, and it can be applied retroactively. Given such a powerful tool of law enforcement is at your disposal, sir, why did you see fit to sidetrack that process?;The President. We used the process to monitor. But also, this is a different era, a different war, Stretch. So what we're— people are changing phone numbers and phone calls, and they're moving quick. And we've got to be able to detect and prevent. I keep saying that, but this is a—it requires quick action.;And without revealing the operating details of our program, I just want to assure the American people that, one, I've got the authority to do this, two, it is a necessary part of my job to protect you, and three, we're guarding your civil liberties. And we're guarding the civil liberties by monitoring the program on a regular basis, by having the folks at NSA, the legal team, as well as the Inspector General, monitor the program, and we're briefing Congress. This is a part of our effort to protect the American people. The American people expect us to protect them and protect their civil liberties. I'm going to do that. That's my job, and I'm going to continue doing my job.;Let's see here—Sanger [David Sanger, New York Times].;Impact of Intelligence Failures/Iran;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Following up on Wendell's question about the intelligence failures ahead of Iraq, one of the side effects appears to have been that the United States has lost some credibility with its allies when it goes to them with new intelligence. You, for example, your administration, has been sharing with some of your allies the contents of a laptop computer that was found in Iran concerning their nuclear program. Yet you are still having——;The President. Is that classified? [ Laughter ] No, never mind, Sanger.;Q. Yet you are still having some difficulty convincing people that Iran has a nuclear program. Can you tell us whether or not you think one of the side effects of the intelligence failure has been that it has limited your ability to deal with future threats like Iran, like North Korea, or any other future threats concerning terrorists?;The President. Sanger, I hate to admit it, but that's an excellent question. No question that the intelligence failure on weapons of mass destruction caused all intelligence services to have to step back and reevaluate the process of gathering and analyzing intelligence—no doubt about that. And so there's been a lot of work done to work with other intelligence agencies to share information about what went right and what went wrong, as well as to build credibility among all services.;I think, David, where it is going to be most difficult to make the case is in the public arena. People will say, "If we're trying to make the case on Iran, well, the intelligence failed in Iraq, therefore, how can we trust the intelligence in Iran?" And part of the reason why there needs to be a public message on this is because the first hope and the first step is a diplomatic effort to get the Iranians to comply with the demands of the free world. If they don't, there's—along the diplomatic path, there's always the United Nations Security Council. But that case of making—beginning to say to the Iranians, "There are consequences for not behaving," requires people to believe that the Iranian nuclear program is, to a certain extent, ongoing. And so we're working hard on that. I mean, it's no question that the credibility of intelligence is necessary for good diplomacy.;Q. Do you intend to make that case publicly too, sir? You haven't yet laid out the evidence on Iran——;The President. Well, I think that the best place to make the case now is still in the councils of government and convincing the EU-3, for example, to continue working the diplomatic angle. Of course, we want this to be solved diplomatically, and we want the Iranians to hear a unified voice. I think people believe that—I know this: People know that an Iran with the capacity to manufacture a nuclear weapon is not in the world's interest. That's universally accepted. And that should be accepted universally, particularly after what the President recently said about the desire to annihilate, for example, an ally of the United States.;And so the idea of Iran having a nuclear weapon is—people say, "Well, we can't let that happen." The next step is to make sure that the world understands that the capacity to enrich uranium for a civilian program would lead to a weapons program. And so therefore, we cannot allow the Iranians to have the capacity to enrich. One of the reasons why I proposed working with the Russians, the Russian idea of allowing Iran to have a civilian nuclear powerplant industry without enriched material—in other words, the enriched materials—without enriching material, the enriching material would come from Russia, in this case, and be picked up by the Russians, was to prevent them from having the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon.;So I think there's universal agreement that we don't want them to have a weapon. And there is agreement that they should not be allowed to learn how to make a weapon. And beyond that, I think that's all I'm going to say.;But, appreciate it.;Baker [Peter Baker, Washington Post].;War on Terror and Safeguarding Civil Liberties;Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I wonder if you can tell us today, sir, what, if any, limits you believe there are or should be on the powers of a President during a war, at wartime? And if the global war on terror is going to last for decades, as has been forecast, does that mean that we're going to see, therefore, a more or less permanent expansion of the unchecked power of the Executive in American society?;The President. First of all, I disagree with your assertion of "unchecked power.;Q. Well——;The President. Hold on for a second, please. There is the check of people being sworn to uphold the law, for starters. There is oversight. We're talking to Congress all the time, and on this program, to suggest there's unchecked power is not listening to what I'm telling you. I'm telling you, we have briefed the United States Congress on this program a dozen times.;This is an awesome responsibility, to make decisions on behalf of the American people, and I understand that, Peter. And we'll continue to work with the Congress, as well as people within our own administration, to constantly monitor programs such as the one I described to you, to make sure that we're protecting the civil liberties of the United States. To say "unchecked power" basically is ascribing some kind of dictatorial position to the President, which I strongly reject.;Q. What limits do you see, sir? What limits do you see broadening——;The President. I just described limits on this particular program, Peter. And that's what's important for the American people to understand. I am doing what you expect me to do and, at the same time, safeguarding the civil liberties of the country.;John [John McKinnon, Wall Street Journal].;President's Goals for 2006;Q. Thank you, sir. Looking ahead to this time next year, what are the top three or top five—take your pick—accomplishments that you hope to have achieved? And in particular, what is your best case scenario for troop levels in Iraq at this time next year?;The President. This is kind of like—this is the ultimate benchmark question. You're trying to not only get me to give benchmarks in Iraq but also benchmarks domestically.;I hope the world is more peaceful. I hope democracy continues to take root around the world. And I hope people are able to find jobs. The job base of this country is expanding, and we need to keep it that way. We want people working. I want New Orleans and Mississippi to be better places. I appreciate very much the progress that Congress is making toward helping a vision of New Orleans rising up and the gulf coast of Mississippi being reconstructed. I think we can make good progress down there.;One of the key decisions our administration has made is to make sure that the levees are better than they were before Katrina, in New Orleans. That will help— people will have the confidence necessary to make investments and to take risk and to expand.;I appreciate the Congress, and I'm looking forward to the Senate confirming—affirming the U.S. Congress's decisions to fund the education or reimburse States for education. There's some good health care initiatives in the bill. We want to make sure that people don't get booted out of housing. We want to work carefully to make sure people understand that there are benefits or help available that—for them to find housing. We want to continue to move temporary housing on the gulf coast of Mississippi so people can get better— closer to their neighborhoods and get their homes rebuilt. We want to start helping Mayor Nagin get temporary housing near New Orleans so as this economy comes back, people will be able to find jobs.;I appreciate the fact that the Congress passed the GO Zone tax incentives in order to attract capital into the region. So one of my hopes is, is that people are able to find hope and optimism after the Katrina disaster down there, that people's lives get up and running again, that people see a brighter future. I've got a lot of hopes, and I'm looking forward to working with Congress to get those—to achieve some big goals.;Joe [Joseph Curl, Washington Times].;Q. [ Inaudible ];The President. You see, I hope by now you've discovered something about me, that when I say we're not going to have artificial timetables of withdrawal, and/or, you know, trying to get me out on a limb on what the troop levels will look like—the answer to your question on troop levels is, it's conditions-based. We have an objective in Iraq, and as we meet those objectives, our commanders on the ground will determine the size of the troop levels.;Nice try—end of your try.;Joe.;Timetables and Terrorism;Q. Mr. President, you said last night that there were only two options in Iraq, withdrawal or victory. And you asked Americans, especially opponents of the war, to reject partisan politics. Do you really expect congressional Democrats to end their partisan warfare and embrace your war strategy? And what can you do about that to make that happen?;The President. Actually, I said that victory in Iraq is much larger than a person, a President, or a political party. And I've had some good visits with Senate and House Democrats about the way forward. They share the same concerns I share. You know, they want our troops out of Iraq as quickly as possible, but they don't want to do so without achieving a victory. These are good, solid Americans that agree that we must win for the sake of our security. And I'm interested in, Joe, their ideas and will continue to listen carefully to their ideas.;On the other hand, there are some in this country that believe, strongly believe, that we ought to get out now. And I just don't agree with them. It's a wrong strategy, and I'd like to tell you again why. One, it would dishearten the Iraqis. The Iraqis are making a great—showing great courage to setting up a democracy. And a democracy in Iraq—I know I've said this, and I'm going to keep saying it, because I want the American people to understand—a democracy in Iraq is vital in the long run to defeating terrorism. And the reason why is, is because democracy is hopeful and optimistic.;Secondly, it sends the wrong signal to our troops. We've got young men and women over there sacrificing. And all of a sudden, because of politics or some focus group or some poll, they stand up and say, "We're out of there." I can't think of anything more dispiriting than—to a kid risking his or her life than to see decisions made based upon politics.;Thirdly, it sends the wrong signal to the enemy. It just says, "Wait them out. They're soft. They don't have the courage to complete the mission. All we've got to do is continue to kill and get these images on the TV screens, and the Americans will leave." And all that will do is embolden these people. Now, I recognize there is a debate in the country, and I fully understand that, about the nature of the enemy. I hear people say, because we took action in Iraq, we stirred them up, they're dangerous. No, they were dangerous before we went into Iraq. That's what the American people have got to understand. That's why I took the decision I took on the NSA decision, because I understand how dangerous they are. And they want to hit us again.;Let me say something about the PATRIOT Act, if you don't mind. It is inexcusable for the United States Senate to let this PATRIOT Act expire. You know, there's an interesting debate in Washington, and you're part of it, that says, well, they didn't connect the dots prior to September the 11th—"they" being not only my administration but previous administrations. And I understand that debate. I'm not being critical of you bringing this issue up and discussing it, but there was a—you might remember, if you take a step back, people were pretty adamant about hauling people up to testify and wondering how come the dots weren't connected.;Well, the PATRIOT Act helps us connect the dots. And now the United States Senate is going to let this bill expire. Not the Senate—a minority of Senators. And I want Senators from New York or Los Angeles or Las Vegas to go home and explain why these cities are safer. It is inexcusable to say, on the one hand, connect the dots, and not give us a chance to do so. We've connected the dots—or trying to connect the dots with the NSA program. And again, I understand the press and Members of the United States Congress saying, "Are you sure you're safeguarding civil liberties?" That's a legitimate question and an important question. And today I hope I'll help answer that. But we're connecting dots as best as we possibly can.;I mentioned in my radio address—my live TV-radio address—that there was two killers in San Diego making phone calls prior to the September the 11th attacks. Had this program been in place then, it is more likely we would have been able to catch them. But they're making phone calls from the United States, overseas, talking about—who knows what they're talking about, but they ended up killing—being a part of the team that killed 3,000 Americans. And so—I forgot what got me on the subject, but nevertheless, I'm going to—we're doing the right thing.;April [April Ryan, American Urban Radio Networks].;Issues of Race;Q. Mr. President, in making the case for domestic spying, could you tell us about planned attacks on the U.S. that were thwarted through your domestic spying plan? And also, on the issue of race, since you brought up the issue of Katrina, 2005 gave us your defense of yourself on race, and some are still not sold on that. In 2006, what are you giving to the Nation on the issue of race, as we're looking to the renewal of the Voting Rights Act in 2007 and things of that nature?;The President. Yes, thanks. April, the fact that some in America believe that I am not concerned about race troubles me. One of the jobs of the President is to help people reconcile and to move forward and to unite. One of the most hurtful things I can hear is, "Bush doesn't care about African Americans," for example. First of all, it's not true. And secondly, I believe that— obviously I've got to do a better job of communicating, I guess, to certain folks, because my job is to say to people, we're all equally American, and the American opportunity applies to you just as much as somebody else. And so I will continue to do my best, April, to reach out.;Now, you talked about—and we have an opportunity, by the way, in New Orleans, for example, to make sure the education system works, to make sure that we promote ownership. I think it is vitally important for ownership to extend to more than just a single community. I think the more African Americans own their own business, the better off America is. I feel strongly that if we can get people to own and manage their own retirement accounts, like personal accounts and Social Security, it makes society a better place. I want people to be able to say, "This is my asset." Heretofore, kind of asset accumulation may have been only a part of—a single—a part of— a segmented part of our strategy. We want assets being passed from one generation to the next. I take pride in this statistic, that more African Americans own a home, or more minorities own a home, now than ever before in our Nation's history, not just African Americans. That's positive.;I still want to make sure, though, that people understand that I care about them, and that my view of the future, a bright future, pertains to them as much as any other neighborhood.;Now, you've mentioned the Voting Rights Act. Congress needs to reauthorize it, and I'll sign it.;The other question was?;Q. Sir——;The President. You asked a multiple-part question.;Q. Yes, I did.;The President. Thank you for violating the multiple-part question rule.;Q. I didn't know there was a law on that. [ Laughter ];The President. There's not a law. It's an Executive order. [ Laughter ] In this case, not monitored by the Congress—[ laughter ]—nor is there any administrative oversight. [ Laughter ];Protecting Intelligence Sources and Methods;Q. Well, without breaking any laws, on to—back on domestic spying. Making the case for that, can you give us some example——;The President. Oh, I got you. Yes, sorry. No, I'm not going to talk about that, because it would help give the enemy notification and/or, perhaps, signal to them methods and uses and sources. And we're not going to do that, which is—it's really important for people to understand that the protection of sources and the protections of methods and how we use information to understand the nature of the enemy is secret. And the reason it's secret is because if it's not secret, the enemy knows about it, and if the enemy knows about it, adjusts.;And again, I want to repeat what I said about Usama bin Laden, the man who ordered the attack that killed 3,000 Americans. We were listening to him. He was using a type of cell phone or a type of phone, and we put it in the newspaper— somebody put it in the newspaper that this was the type of device he was using to communicate with his team, and he changed. I don't know how I can make the point more clear, that any time we give up—and this is before they attacked us, by the way—revealing sources, methods, and what we use the information for, simply says to the enemy, "Change.;Now, if you don't think there's an enemy out there, then I can understand why you ought to say, "Just tell us all you know." I happen to know there's an enemy there. And the enemy wants to attack us. That is why I hope you can feel my passion about the PATRIOT Act. It is inexcusable to say to the American people, "We're going to be tough on terror but take away the very tools necessary to help fight these people." And by the way, the tools exist still to fight medical fraud, in some cases, or other—or drug dealers. But with the expiration of the PATRIOT Act, it prevents us from using them to fight the terrorists. Now, that is just unbelievable. And I'm going to continue talking about this issue and reminding the American people about the importance of the PATRIOT Act and how necessary it is for us in Washington, DC, to do our job to protect you.;Let's see, who else? Jackson—Action Jackson [David Jackson, USA Today]. Got him a new job and everything.;President's Leadership;Q. Thank you, sir. One of the things we've seen this year is the reduction in your approval ratings. And I know how you feel about polls, but it appears to be taking something out of your political clout, as evidenced by the PATRIOT Act vote. What do you attribute your lower polls to, and are you worried that independents are losing confidence in your leadership?;The President. David, my job is to confront big challenges and lead. And I fully understand, everybody is not going to agree with my decisions. But the President's job is to do what he thinks is right, and that's what I'm going to continue to do.;Secondly, if people want to play politics with the PATRIOT Act, it's—let me just put—it's not in the best interests of the country, David. And yesterday—or this morning, I spoke to the Speaker, who called me. He said, "Mr. President, we had a pretty good couple of days. Got your budget passed. Got the Katrina relief package going forward. We're supporting our troops. We've got the free trade"—we talked about passing CAFTA in the past. I mean, we've done a lot. And it's good for the country, by the way.;And so I'm just going to keep doing my job. Maybe you can keep focusing on all these focus groups and polls and all that business. My job is to lead, to keep telling the American people what I believe, work to bring people together to achieve a common objective, stand on principle, and that's the way I'm going to lead. I did so in 2005, and I'm going to do so in 2006.;Thank you all for coming. Happy holidays to you. Appreciate it.</td></tr>

Bush: Proclamation 7987 - To Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America- United States Free Trade Agreement</td><td class="c6">February 28, 2006</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;1. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the "Agreement countries"). The Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "Act") (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462) (19 U.S.C. 4001 note).;2.

Section 201 of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28 of the Agreement.;4.

Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act, each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country, subject to the exceptions set out in section 201(a)(3)(B) of the Act.;6.

Section 203 of the Act provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of implementing preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement. I have decided that it is necessary to include these rules of origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other goods, in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS).;8. Section 203(o) of the Act authorizes the President to determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and those Agreement countries for which the Agreement has entered into force, and to add any such fabric, yarn, or fiber to the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement in a restricted or unrestricted quantity, to eliminate a restriction on the quantity of a fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the fabric, yarn, or fiber to the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement in a restricted quantity, and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the list in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.;9.

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA) to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements.;12. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George W.

The Commissioner shall take actions as directed by the CITA to carry out any such determination.;(8) The United States Trade Representative is authorized to exercise my authority under section 104 of the Act to obtain advice from the appropriate advisory committees and the United States International Trade Commission on the proposed implementation of an action by presidential proclamation, to submit a report on such proposed action to the appropriate congressional committees, and to consult with those congressional committees regarding the proposed action.;(9) The United States Trade Representative is authorized to modify U.S. note 20 to subchapter XXII of chapter 98 of the HTS in a notice published in the Federal Register to reflect modifications pursuant to paragraph (4) of this proclamation by the CITA to the list of fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Annex 3.25 of the Agreement.;(10)(a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in Annex II to Publication 3829.;(b) Except as provided in paragraph (10)(a) of this proclamation, this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after March 1, 2006.;(11) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Remarks on the Nomination of Robert J. Portman To Be Director of the Office of Management and Budget and Susan C. Schwab To Be United States Trade Representative and an Exchange With Reporters</td><td class="c6">April 18, 2006</td><td class="c7">The President. Good morning. Today I'm announcing my nomination of two outstanding individuals to serve in my Cabinet and on my economic team.;First, I will nominate Rob Portman to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Rob will replace Josh Bolten, who this week started in his new role as my Chief of Staff. The Office of Management and Budget is one of the most essential agencies of our Government. The OMB has a central responsibility of implementing the full range of my administration's agenda, from defense programs that will keep our people secure, to energy initiatives that will break our dependence on oil, to tax policies that keep our economy growing and creating jobs.;In these and other areas, the job of the OMB Director is to ensure that the Government spends the taxpayers' money wisely or not at all. He is the person in charge of meeting our goal to cutting the budget deficit in half by 2009. And he is responsible for managing Federal programs efficiently. The American people deserve results for every hard-earned dollar they send to Washington.;The job of OMB Director is really an important post, and Rob Portman is the right man to take it on. Rob's talent, expertise, and record of success are well-known within my administration and on Capitol Hill. For the past 11 months, Rob has served as United States Trade Representative. When he took the job, I told him to focus on opening new markets for American exports to ensure that our producers and farmers are treated fairly and to get Congress to pass the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. He's accomplished those goals.;I signed CAFTA into law last summer, and Rob Portman and his staff completed trade agreements with Bahrain, Oman, Peru, and Colombia. He also re-energized the Doha trade talks at the World Trade Organization. Before joining my Cabinet, Rob represented the Second District of Ohio in the United States Congress for more than a decade. He was a key part of the House leadership. He was an influential member of the Ways and Means Committee, and he served as vice chairman of the Budget Committee.;His legislative achievements range from reforming the Internal Revenue Service, providing tax relief for working families, to encouraging retirement savings. Rob's leadership in Congress was also marked by an ability to work across the aisle and bring people together to get things done. And he's going to bring that same skill to his new post.;As Director of OMB, Rob will have a leading role on my economic team. He will be part of daily senior staff meetings led by Josh Bolten. He will consult often and work closely with legislators on Capitol Hill. He will be a powerful voice for progrowth policies and spending restraint.;Rob is a man of deep integrity. He knows the priorities of my administration, he can get things done. And the Senate should confirm him promptly as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.;I'm also pleased to announce that I'm going to nominate Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab to succeed Rob Portman as the new U.S. Trade Representative.;Trade is one of the most powerful engines of growth and job creation. America accounts for about 5 percent of the world's population, and that means that 95 percent of our potential customers live overseas. So my administration has taken an aggressive agenda to break down barriers to American exports across the world.;When I took office, we had three free trade agreements. Now, we have free trade agreements with 11 countries, and 18 more are pending. Susan will work hard to conclude these agreements and ensure that American goods, services, and crops are treated fairly in overseas markets.;Last year, the countries with which we have free trade agreements represented about 7 percent of the economy abroad but about 42 percent of our exports. Lowering trade barriers to the sale of our goods and services helps provide a level playing field for American workers and farmers and ranchers. And that means more jobs and opportunity, because our workers and ranchers and farmers can compete with anybody, anytime, anywhere, so long as the rules are fair, and Susan Schwab understands that.;As Deputy U.S. Trade Representative for the past 5 months, Ambassador Schwab worked tirelessly to open up new markets, and at the same time, making sure our people were treated fairly. Her trade portfolio covered several continents, and she led USTR efforts in a number of vital policy areas, including intellectual property enforcement.;Susan also worked closely with Ambassador Portman to advance the Doha negotiations. Now she will use her experience to help complete the Doha round and create other new opportunities for American exporters.;Ambassador Schwab started her career as an agricultural trade negotiator in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and she served our Nation overseas as a trade policy officer in our Embassy in Tokyo. In the 1980s, she worked as a trade specialist and then legislative director for Senator Jack Danforth, who chaired a key Senate subcommittee on trade. In the administration of former President Bush, she led a staff of more than a thousand as Director General of the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. Susan has also served as an executive in the private sector at Motorola and as a professor and administrator at the University of Maryland.;Throughout her distinguished career, Susan has earned the respect of her colleagues, and she has my confidence as well. The Senate should promptly confirm her nomination to be United States Trade Representative.;I appreciate the service that Rob and Susan have given the American people, and I'm really grateful they've agreed to take on new responsibilities. I also thank Rob and Susan's families today. I'm really glad that Rob's wife, Jane, is with us, and it's my pleasure to have welcomed Susan's parents, Gerald and Joan, to the Oval Office and to the Rose Garden. Glad you all are here.;I look forward to the Senate confirming Rob and Susan and welcoming them to be new members of my Cabinet.;Congratulations, and thank you for your willingness to serve.;[ At this point, Director-designate Portman and Ambassador-designate Schwab made brief remarks. ];Iran;Q. Mr. President.;The President. Hold on for a second, please. I'll take a couple of questions. Nedra [Nedra Pickler, Associated Press], Patsy [Patricia Wilson, Reuters], and Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News], in that order.;Q. Thank you, Mr. President.;The President. A little louder, I'm getting older.;Q. Sir, when you talk about Iran and you talk about how you have diplomatic efforts, you also say all options are on the table. Does that include the possibility of a nuclear strike? Is that something that your administration will plan for?;The President. All options are on the table. We want to solve this issue diplomatically, and we're working hard to do so. The best way to do so is, therefore, to be a united effort with countries who recognize the danger of Iran having a nuclear weapon. And that's why we're working very closely with countries like France and Germany and Great Britain. I intend, of course, to bring the subject up of Iranian ambitions to have a nuclear weapon with Hu Jintao this Thursday. And we'll continue to work diplomatically to get this problem solved.;Patsy.;Israel-Palestinian Authority Relations;Q. Sir, are you encouraging Israel to show restraint in reaction to yesterday's Palestinian bombing? Or would a measured military response be appropriate?;The President. I have consistently reminded all parties that they must be mindful of whatever actions they take and mindful of the consequences. Our goal is to have two states living side by side in peace. I strongly deplore the loss of innocent life in the attack on the folks in Israel yesterday. It is unjustified, and it is unnecessary. And for those who love peace in the Palestinian Territories, they must stand up and reject this kind of violence.;Kelly.;White House Staff/Fuel;Q. Morning, Mr. President. Do you expect that there will be some changes that were not voluntary? Today you've highlighted openings in your administration, but will Mr. Bolten ask some people to leave? And would you accept his counsel for Cabinet changes, as well as White House staffers?;The President. I understand this is—you know, this is a matter of high speculation here in Washington. It's the game of musical chairs, I guess you'd say, that people love to follow. My instructions to Josh Bolten was that I expect him to design the White House structure so that it will function so that he can do his job, function in a way so he's more likely to be able to do his job. And, of course, he will bring different recommendations to me as to who should be here and who should not be here.;And I'm the person who believes in aligning authority and responsibility. I've given him enormous responsibility and authority and expect the White House to work well. And it did under Andy Card, by the way. I'm most proud of his tenure as the Chief of Staff. But with a new man will come some changes. And Josh has got all the rights to make those recommendations to me. And, of course, I listen to advice as to my Cabinet as well. I must tell you that I'm—I've got strong confidence in my Cabinet officials, all of them, and I appreciate the service they've rendered.;But I also understand what happens in Washington. You know, a little flicker of gossip starts moving hard, and people jump all over it. The thing the American people have got to know is we'll structure this White House so it continues to function to deal with major problems. And we're dealing with major problems. We're dealing with a war on terror. We're dealing with high gasoline prices.;And let me remind people that these high gasoline prices are caused by primarily three reasons: one, the increase in the price of crude oil. It's one of the reasons I stood up in front of the Congress and said, we've got to have strong and active research and development to get us to diversify away from crude oil. It's tight supply worldwide, and we've got increasing demand from countries like India and China, which means that any disruption of supply or perceived disruption of supply is going to cause the price of crude to go up. And that affects the price of gasoline.;Secondly, there's increasing demand. At this time of year, people are beginning to drive more, getting out on the highways, taking a little time off, and they're moving around. And that increasing demand is also part of the reason the price of gasoline is going up.;And thirdly, we're switching fuel mixes. The summer fuel mix is different from State to State and is different from what is being used in the winter. And therefore, the combination of these creates higher gasoline prices. And I'm concerned about higher gasoline prices. I'm concerned what it means to the working families and small businesses, and I'm also mindful that the Government has the responsibility to make sure that we watch very carefully and to investigate possible price gouging. And we'll do just that.;Q. Is there going to be rationing, do you think?;The President. No, I don't—that's your word.;Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld;Q. Mr. President, you've made it a practice of not commenting on potential personnel moves——;The President. Of course I did.;Q. ——of calling it speculation——;The President. You can understand why, because we've got people's reputations at stake. And on Friday, I stood up and said, I don't appreciate the speculation about Don Rumsfeld, he's doing a fine job, I strongly support him.;Q. But what do you say to critics who believe that you're ignoring the advice of retired generals, military commanders, who say that there needs to be a change?;The President. I say, I listen to all voices, but mine is the final decision. And Don Rumsfeld is doing a fine job. He's not only transforming the military, he's fighting a war on terror. He's helping us fight a war on terror. I have strong confidence in Don Rumsfeld. I hear the voices, and I read the front page, and I know the speculation. But I'm the decider, and I decide what is best. And what's best is for Don Rumsfeld to remain as the Secretary of Defense.;I want to thank you all very much.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Cinco de Mayo Celebration</td><td class="c6">May 4, 2006</td><td class="c7">Thank you. Please be seated. Bienvenidos. Welcome to the White House. I'm honored to have so many distinguished Hispanic and Mexican American leaders here for the Cinco de Mayo celebration. You may have noticed this celebration is not on the cinco de Mayo —[ laughter ]—it's on the quatro de Mayo. [ Laughter ] It's such an important holiday, we thought we would start early. [ Laughter ];I appreciate Hector, good to see you— head of the SBA is with us today. Gaddi Vasquez, thank you for coming. Thank you both for bringing—thank you for bringing your wife, Hector. I want to thank Anna Cabral, who is the Treasurer, and glad you brought Victor. Thanks for coming.;I appreciate the Ambassadors who have joined us. Ambassador de Mexico is with us today— Embajador, gracias—y tambien, mi amigo, the Ambassador from the United States to Mexico, Antonio Garza. Welcome you both. Glad you're here. I appreciate Eduardo Aguirre, Ambassador to Spain. Thank you for coming, Eduardo—Hans Hertell, the Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. Thank you all very much for coming. Thanks for serving the country, and thanks for serving your country, Ambassador, as well.;I appreciate the military personnel who are here today. We're proud of you. Thanks for wearing the uniform of the United States of America.;Before I introduce our entertainer, I do want to share some thoughts with you about the importance of Cinco de Mayo, for it commemorates a joyful moment in Mexican history. Americans must understand that it was a time when Mexican soldiers won the Battle of Puebla and defended their independence. So obviously, Cinco de Mayo is a day of special pride for citizens of Mexico, but it is, as well, for Americans. It is a reminder of a proud heritage we share with our neighbor to the south. That's how I view the day.;We pay tribute to that heritage, and we honor the warmth and importance of the friendship between our two nations. The United States and Mexico are united by ties of family and by commerce and by history and by culture and by values. Both nations believe in the rights and the dignity of all people. We share an important trade relationship. We have discovered that trade between our nations is good for our peoples. We believe in the ideals of freedom and independence that Cinco de Mayo represents.;Here in the United States, Mexican Americans have helped build our country and helped shape our culture. Mexican Americans have made our Nation more vibrant and more hopeful cada dia. Mexican Americans have enriched the American experience with contributions to business and the arts and music and sports. Latino entrepreneurs are creating jobs across the country, the number of Hispanic-owned businesses is growing at three times the national rate. More Hispanic Americans own their homes than ever before in our Nation's history.;Many Mexican Americans have also shown their devotion to this country by defending it. More than 600,000 of our veterans are of Mexican descent. I see some of our veterans back—I'm sure—we got a lot of veterans here, as a matter of fact. I want to thank you for setting such a good example for those who wear the uniform today.;Many Mexican Americans are wearing the uniform of the United States military, and they're defending our country with valor. They're making America more secure and, at the same time, laying the foundation of peace for generations to come.;I know our citizens have enormous pride in the Mexican heritage, and rightly so. We also know that America has thrived as a nation because we've always welcomed newcomers who, in turn, embrace our values and our way of life. Becoming an American is a great privilege, and it carries with it responsibilities. Those who come here to start new lives in our country have a responsibility to understand what America is about and the responsibility to learn the English language so they can better understand our national character and participate fully in American life. That's what we want. Making this effort is also key to unlocking the opportunities of America, allowing new folks to rise in society and realize the American Dream.;In this country, we're now having an important debate about immigration. And it is really important that we discuss this issue in a way that is worthy of this country's best traditions. Our Nation does not have to choose between being a compassionate society and a lawful society. A lawful society is one that enforces its laws and enforces its border, that's what a lawful society does. A compassionate society rejects a system that treats people as if they're something to be traded, honors human rights and human dignity, helps people out of the shadows of society, treats people in a decent and humane way.;So I support strengthening our borders, and I support a temporary-worker program that would match willing workers with American employers. See, I think we need to create a secure and legal channel for people to come to this country to work. It will reduce the number of people trying to sneak across our border. It will treat people humanely. It will get rid of the coyotes and the document forgers. It will affirm our belief that every person has got dignity and every person has got value, and at the same time, it will make it easier for us to be a nation of law and to protect our border.;Immigration reform needs to be comprehensive because all elements of this problem must be addressed together, or none of them will be solved at all. The American people must conduct this debate with dignity. They must remember that we're a nation of immigrants. They must understand—they must remember that throughout our history, people have come to America because this is a place where they can pursue their dreams no matter who they are or where they're from.;Mexican Americans have brought with them a culture based upon faith in God, a deep love for family, and a belief that hard work leads to a better life. Every immigrant who lives by these values makes the United States a better country, makes our future brighter as one nation under God.;Across America tomorrow, there will be many celebrations of Cinco de Mayo. The performances we're going to see today represent some of the very fine talent. It reminds us that we're a nation that is strong because of our diversity. There's going to be a lot of traditional music, a lot of pretty good Mexican food too, I bet you. [ Laughter ] Kind of reminds us of Texas, doesn't it, Ambassador?;May God continue to bless all of us who are fortunate enough to live in this land, and may God continue to bless our country and the many sons and daughters of Mexico who call our Nation home. Happy Cinco de Mayo. And now it is my pleasure to introduce one of Mexico's great talents, Graciela Beltran.</td></tr>

World Trade Week is an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of trade for people everywhere.;America is a great force for prosperity, and our country's economic and national security interests are advanced through strong economic ties with our friends and allies. Since 2001, my Administration has concluded or implemented free trade agreements with 15 countries. We are working toward agreements with 11 additional countries, and we will continue to pursue further opportunities.;Last August, I was pleased to sign legislation implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). CAFTA-DR will reduce tariffs on American goods and expand export opportunities for American businesses. When the rules are fair, American people and businesses can compete with anyone in the world. CAFTA-DR will also advance our commitment to democracy and prosperity for our neighbors.;Studies have shown that the elimination of global trade barriers could help lift hundreds of millions of the world's poor out of poverty and boost economic growth around the world. An important opportunity to deliver the full benefits of trade to people around the world is the Doha Round of trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization. An ambitious Doha agreement could bring benefits to all nations, especially the developing world, and my Administration is working for a successful conclusion to these negotiations.;During World Trade Week and throughout the year, the United States remains committed to increasing free and fair trade and to improving the standard of living for our citizens. By working with our friends and allies, we will continue to help build a world that lives in liberty, trades in freedom, and grows in prosperity.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2006, as World Trade Week.

Bush: Remarks at a Swearing-In Ceremony for Robert J. Portman as Director of the Office of Management and Budget</td><td class="c6">June 2, 2006</td><td class="c7">Please be seated. Good morning. Welcome to the White House. Today I'm pleased to witness the swearing-in of Rob Portman as the new Director of the Office of Management and Budget. We welcome Rob's wife, Jane, as well as his brother, Wym, and other family members here with us today. I want to thank you all for supporting Rob.;As the OMB Director, Rob will not be racking up the frequent flyer miles that he did as America's Trade Representative. I think that's going to be a relief for Jane and his children. [ Laughter ];I appreciate the Vice President being here. I want to thank Carlos Gutierrez for joining us as well, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce, John Walters, Office of National Drug Control Policy. Congressman Mike Turner, it's awfully kind for you to come back to witness the swearing-in of your friend. I appreciate the former Secretary, Don Evans, for being here as well.;The job of the OMB Director is one of the most important in our Federal Government. The OMB Director is a critical member of my Cabinet. He plays a vital role in every aspect of my administration's agenda, from securing the homeland to winning the war on terror to growing our economy and creating jobs.;For the past 3 years, these responsibilities have been carried out by a talented public servant, Josh Bolten. At my direction, Josh has pursued clear goals at OMB. He's worked to implement progrowth economic policies and ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely or not at all. He's improved the management of Federal programs so that when we do spend taxpayer money, they deliver real results for the American people. He's put us on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.;Now that Josh is serving as my Chief of Staff, I've turned to another outstanding public servant to take up these important responsibilities, and that's Rob Portman. Rob has served for more than a decade in the United States Congress, where he was vice chairman of the House Budget Committee, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, and a member of the House leadership. In Congress, Rob earned a reputation as an effective legislator who worked with members of both political parties.;For the past year, Rob has served his country as United States Trade Representative. He worked tirelessly to open new markets for American exports and to ensure that American workers, farmers, and small businesses are treated fairly overseas. He's reenergized the Doha round trade talks at the World Trade Organization. He completed trade agreements with Bahrain, Oman, Peru, and Colombia and launched new trade agreement negotiations with the Republic of Korea and Malaysia. His leadership was critical to the passage of the landmark Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement last summer.;Rob assumes his responsibilities as OMB Director at a really important time for our economy. This morning's economic report shows that America's national unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent because we added 75,000 jobs in the month of May. The American economy has now added jobs for 33 months in a row and has created more than 5.3 million new jobs. In the first quarter of 2006, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 5.3 percent— that's the fastest growth in 2 1/2 years. Productivity is high, and that is leading to higher wages and a higher standard of living for the American people. The American economy is powerful. It is productive, and it is prosperous, and we intend to keep it that way.;I've given Rob a clear agenda. We'll continue to pursue progrowth economic policies. The tax relief we delivered has helped set off the economic expansion that we're seeing today. And Rob will build on this success by working with Congress to maintain a progrowth, low-tax environment.;Tax relief is important to families, workers, and entrepreneurs, and it is also vital to our efforts to reduce the budget deficit. When I came to office, taxes were too high, our economy was headed into a recession, and tax revenues were on the decline. By cutting taxes, we've helped produce a strong economic recovery, and that economic growth is producing more tax revenues. In 2005, tax revenues grew by a record $274 billion, an increase of nearly 15 percent over the previous year. This year, the economy has continued to grow, and tax revenues are growing with it. These increased revenues are helping us to meet our goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.;To meet this goal, we must also control the Federal appetite for spending. Every year since I took office, we've slowed the growth of discretionary spending that's not related to the military or homeland security. My last two budgets have actually cut this kind of spending. And with Rob's leadership, we will continue to cut unnecessary spending and show respect for the taxpayers' money.;To cut unnecessary spending, I need the line-item veto. I've sent Congress a line-item veto proposal that has strong bipartisan support. And Rob will work with his former colleagues on Capitol Hill to get a bill to my desk so I can sign it into law.;Rob will also work with Congress to pass reforms that will help us reduce earmarks and wasteful spending in the Federal budget. Congress is now considering an emergency supplemental bill that can show the American people we're determined to be responsible with their money. I've set a clear limit on spending that I will accept in this legislation, and if this bill goes over that limit, I'll veto it.;In the long run, the biggest challenge to our Nation's budgetary health is entitlement spending on programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Entitlement programs are growing much faster than our ability to pay for them. To keep these programs solvent, we need to slow their growth to a level we can afford. It's not a cut. It's the difference between slowing your car down to the speed limit and putting your car in reverse. Every American family and business has to set priorities and live within a budget, and so should the United States Congress.;My administration is committed to fiscal discipline and economic growth, and these policies will have a strong champion in Rob Portman. As OMB Director, Rob now assumes one of the most important posts in Washington. I'm pleased that he's agreed to serve our country once again. I look forward to working with him to keep America's economy the envy of the world, to create jobs and opportunity for all our citizens, and deliver results for the American taxpayer.;Congratulations.</td></tr>

On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (Agreement) with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (Agreement countries). The Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "Act") (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462) (19 U.S.C. 4001 note).;2. Section 201 of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Article 3.3 and Annex 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) of the Agreement.;3. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Act, each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country.;4.

Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA, as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 106-200), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated CBTPA beneficiary countries on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country.;6. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 201 of the Act and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and the Act having taken effect pursuant to section 107(a), do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the Agreement to Guatemala, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the Agreement, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain goods, to reflect the removal of Guatemala from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, to reflect the removal of Guatemala from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA and the CBTPA, to implement statistical monitoring relating to tariff provisions that the President previously proclaimed to implement the Agreement, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex of Publication 3861 of the United States International Trade Commission, entitled "Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to Guatemala" (Publication 3861), which is incorporated by reference into this proclamation.;(2)(a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraph (1) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in the Annex to Publication 3861.;(b) Except as provided in paragraph (2)(a) of this proclamation, this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 2006.;(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirtieth.;GEORGE W.

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report (Tab A) are justifications for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions is vital to the national interests of the United States.;Although President Karzai has strongly attacked narcotrafficking as the greatest threat to Afghanistan, one third of the Afghan economy remains opium-based, which contributes to widespread public corruption. The government at all levels must be held accountable to deter and eradicate poppy cultivation, remove and prosecute corrupt officials, and investigate, prosecute, or extradite narcotraffickers and those financing their activities. We are concerned that failure to act decisively now could undermine security, compromise democratic legitimacy, and imperil international support for vital assistance.;My Administration is concerned with the decline in Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation since October 2005. Bolivia, the world's third largest producer of cocaine, has undertaken policies that have allowed the expansion of coca cultivation and slowed the pace of eradication until mid-year, when it picked up. The Government of Bolivia's (GOB) policy of "zero cocaine, but not zero coca" has focused primarily on interdiction, to the near exclusion of its necessary complements, eradication and alternative development. However, the GOB has been supportive of interdiction initiatives and has had positive results in seizing cocaine and decommissioning rustic labs. We would encourage the GOB to refocus its efforts on eliminating excess coca, the source of cocaine. This would include eradicating at least 5,000 hectares, including in the Chapare region, eliminating the "cato" exemption to Bolivian law, rescinding Ministerial Resolution 112, Administrative Resolution 083, and establishing tight controls on the sale of licit coca leaf for traditional use, and implementing strong precursor chemical control measures to prevent conversion of coca to cocaine. My Administration plans to review Bolivia's performance in these specific areas within 6 months.;The Government of Canada (GOC) continued to effectively curb the diversion of precursor chemicals that are required for methamphetamine production to feed U.S. illegal markets. The GOC also continued to seize laboratories that produce MDMA/Ecstasy consumed in both Canada and the United States. The principal drug concern was the continuing large-scale production of high-potency, indoor-grown marijuana for export to the United States. The United States enjoyed excellent cooperation with Canada across a broad range of law enforcement issues and shared goals.;The Government of Ecuador (GOE) has made considerable progress in combating narcotics trafficking destined for the United States. However, a dramatic increase in the quantity of cocaine transported toward the United States using Ecuadorian-flagged ships and indications of increased illegal armed group activity along Ecuador's northern border with Colombia remain areas of serious concern. Effective cooperation and streamlined maritime operational procedures between the U.S. Coast Guard and the Ecuadorian Navy are resulting in an increase in the amount of cocaine interdicted. Building on that cooperation, we will work with Ecuador to change the circumstances that make Ecuadorian-flagged vessels and Ecuadorian citizenship so attractive to drug traffickers.;As a result of the elections in Haiti, the new government now has a clear mandate from the Haitian people to bring crime, violent gangs, and drug trafficking under control. We urge the new government to strengthen and accelerate ongoing efforts to rebuild and reform Haiti's law enforcement and judicial institutions and to consult closely with the United States to define achievable and verifiable steps to accomplish these goals.;While the Government of Nigeria continues to take substantive steps to curb official corruption, it remains a major challenge in Nigeria. We strongly encourage the government to continue to adequately fund and support the anti-corruption bodies that have been established there in order to fully address Nigeria's ongoing fight against corruption. We urge Nigeria to continue improving the effectiveness of the National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency and, in particular, improve enforcement operations at major airports/seaports and against major drug kingpins, to include targeting their financial assets. We look forward to working with Nigerian officials to increase extraditions and assisting in drug enforcement operations.;Although there have not been any drug seizures or apprehensions of drug traffickers with a connection to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) since 2004, we remain concerned about DPRK state- directed criminal activity. The United States Government has made clear to the DPRK that an end to all involvement in criminal activity is a necessary prerequisite to entry into the international community.;Under provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act (CMEA), which modified section 489(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and section 490(a) of the FAA, a report will be made to the Congress on March 1, 2007, naming the five countries that legally exported the largest amount of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as the top five methamphetamine precursor importers with the highest rate of diversion for illicit drug production. This report will be sent concurrently with the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which will also contain additional reporting on methamphetamine precursor chemicals pursuant to the CMEA.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;George W.

I'm proud to be with a strong leader who is focused on reform and rule of law and prosperity.;The President informed me that the economy of the Dominican Republic grew by 9 percent last year. And I want to congratulate you, Mr. President.;We talked about how to continue economic growth and vitality. It's in the interests of the United States that the Dominican Republic have a strong economy. We talked about the need for us to help with the multilateral institutions, to work with— for them to work with this Government to help with cash flows and cash demands so that this economy can continue its growth and strength.;We talked about DR-CAFTA and how important this piece of legislation is to the people of the Dominican Republic and to the people of the United States. And I assured the President that we will implement DR-CAFTA as quickly as possible, as soon as possible. And to that end, I had my trade minister, Ambassador Susan Schwab, here to make sure that we both heard the message of the President, that this was a very important piece of legislation and that we have committed—our Government has committed to working with you, Mr. President, to get this done as quickly as possible.;Y por fin, we talked about the need for us to work closely on drug trafficking. The United States of America must continue to work to diminish the demand for drugs, and we are. As well, we want to work with our partners in the hemisphere, particularly the Dominican Republic, to interdict the drugs and to help these countries be able to avoid and fight off the scourge of drugs, because there is a direct correlation between drugs and crime. And the more we can cut down on drug use and drug trafficking and drug supplies, the easier it will be for respective countries to protect their people.;Mr. President, I appreciate very much your presence here. I thank you for your leadership in the hemisphere. I appreciate the advice you have given me on how we can work together to make sure our own neighborhood is secure and peaceful and hopeful. Welcome.;President Fernandez Reyna. I thank you very much, Mr. President. It's a pleasure to be here. And I want to thank President Bush for the warm welcome that he has given me, along with my delegation, here to the Oval Office of the White House.;As the President indicated, we have touched on a number of issues of mutual interest to our two countries. First of all, DR-CAFTA, its implementation, hopefully, will take place very soon. We are now in the final phase. This is a bill now before our own Congress in the Dominican Republic. We are dealing with some minor legal amendments, and our two teams have been working very hard to obtain a speedy implementation of DR-CAFTA. President Bush and we have agreed to the need to accelerate this process to benefit both our countries.;Second, as President Bush indicated, we have also touched on the issues of disbursements by multilateral institutions. These are extremely important in order to help the progress of countries like the Dominican Republic to establish confidence, to maintain the confidence in our countries, and also to help us sustain ability of our economies.;The Dominican Republic has agreements with these multilateral institutions, and we hope that they will be honored soon, with regard to these disbursements. The sooner that they are complied with, the better it will be for us.;And third, of course, we have touched on a number of issues such as the issue of drug trafficking, as President Bush mentioned, the issue of crime, the issue of the good relations that we have had for so many years between the United States and the Dominican Republic, the issue of good governance, the issue of respect for human rights, and a number of other things.;It has been a very good meeting. Thank you so much.;President Bush. Gracias por su tiempo.</td></tr>

Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the "1988 Act") (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States International Trade Commission (the "Commission") to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection. The Commission has recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)) to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the "Convention").;2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.;3. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (the "NAFTA") with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "NAFTA Implementation Act") (19 U.S.C. 3331), the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out articles 302, 305, 307, 308, and 703 and Annexes 302.2, 307.1, 308.1, 308.2, 300-B, 703.2, and 703.3 of the NAFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods of Mexico under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;4. Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with respect to the United States the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Schedule XX), that were entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)) and approved in section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)).;5. Pursuant to the authority provided in section 111 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521) and sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act, Proclamation 6763 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of Schedule XX. In order to ensure the continuation of such rates of duty for imported goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.;6. Presidential Proclamation 7351 of October 2, 2000, implemented section 211 of the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (title II of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 286) in order to provide certain preferential tariff treatment to eligible articles that are the product of any country that the President designates as a "CBTPA beneficiary country" and that the President determines to have satisfied the requirements of section 213(b)(4)(A)(ii) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(4)(A)(ii)). Section 213(b)(3) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(3)) provides that the tariff treatment accorded at any time under the CBTPA to any article referred to in section 213(b)(1)(B) through (F) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(1)(B) through (F)) that is a CBTPA originating good shall be identical to the tariff treatment that is accorded at such time under Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA to an article described in the same 8-digit subheading of the HTS that is a good of Mexico and is imported into the United States.;7. Pursuant to section 213(b) of the CBERA, Proclamation 7351 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to provide such identical tariff treatment to CBTPA originating goods. In order to ensure the continuation of the rates of duty for imported goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;8. Presidential Proclamation 7512 of December 7, 2001, implemented the Agreement Between the United States of America and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (JFTA), with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 101 of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Area Implementation Act (the "JFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 2112 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the concessions set forth in Annex 2.1 to the JFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;9. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USSFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 of the USSFTA and the schedule of reductions with respect to the Republic of Singapore set forth in Annex 2B of the USSFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;10. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods set forth in Annex 3.3 to the USCFTA), 3.7, 3.9, and 3.20(8), (9), (10), and (11) of the USCFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;11. Presidential Proclamation 7857 of December 20, 2004, implemented the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement (USAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USAFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, and 2.6 of the USAFTA and the schedule of reductions with respect to Australia set forth in Annex 2B of the USAFTA.;12. Because the substance of the changes to the Convention will be reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of the parties to the USAFTA, the rules of origin set out in Annexes 4A and 5A of that Agreement must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USAFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention. The USAFTA parties have agreed to make these changes.;13. Section 203 of the USAFTA Act provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USAFTA. Section 203(o) of the USAFTA Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USAFTA and any subordinate tariff categories necessary to carry out the USAFTA.;14. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to sections 201 and 203 of the USAFTA Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USAFTA will continue to be given to originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention and to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;15. Presidential Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USMFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 4.1, 4.3.9, 4.3.10, 4.3.11, 4.3.13, 4.3.14, and 4.3.15 of the USMFTA and the schedule of reductions with respect to Morocco set forth in Annex IV of the USMFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;16. Presidential Proclamations 7987 of February 28, 2006, 7991 of March 24, 2006, 7996 of March 31, 2006, and 8034 of June 30, 2006, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR Agreement) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act") (19 U.S.C. 4031), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 3.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.21, 3.26, 3.27, and 3.28, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of the United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods), 3.27, and 3.28. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;17. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USBFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.2.8, and 3.2.9, and the schedule of reductions with respect to Bahrain set forth in Annex 2-B of the USBFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;18. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "Trade Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 1102 and 1206 of the 1988 Act, section 214 of the CBERA, section 201 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, section 111 of the URAA, section 101 of the JFTA Act, section 201 of the USSFTA Act, section 201 of the USCFTA Act, sections 201 and 203 of the USAFTA Act, section 201 of the USMFTA Act, section 201 of the CAFTA-DR Act, section 201 of the USBFTA Act, and section 604 of the Trade Act do proclaim that;(1)

tariff categories, and to make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of Publication 3898 of the United States International Trade

On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the "Agreement countries"). The Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "Act") (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 462) (19 U.S.C. 4011 note).;2. Section 201 of the Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Article 3.3 and Annex 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) of the Agreement.;3. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Act, each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country.;4. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act, each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country, subject to the exceptions set out in section 201(a)(3)(B) of the Act.;5.

Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the "NAFTA Implementation Act"), incorporated in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.;8. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the NAFTA and to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).;9.

Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 201 of the Act, section 1634(c)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and the Act having taken effect pursuant to section 107(a), do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the Agreement to the Dominican Republic, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the Agreement, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain goods, to reflect the removal of the Dominican Republic from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, to reflect the removal of the Dominican Republic from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA and the CBTPA, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annexes I and II of Publication 3901 of the United States International Trade Commission, entitled Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to the Dominican Republic (Publication 3901), which is incorporated by reference into this proclamation.;(2) The CITA is authorized to exercise the function of the President under section 1634(c)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 of determining whether Nicaragua has failed to comply with a commitment under an agreement between the United States and Nicaragua with regard to the administration of the tariff preference level for Nicaragua provided in Annex 3.28 of the Agreement and, on making such a determination, to reduce the overall limit in the tariff preference level for Nicaragua provided in Annex 3.28 of the Agreement.;(3) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA, general note 12 to the HTS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.;(4)(a) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraph (1) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in Annex I or II of Publication 3901.;(b) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraph (3) of this proclamation shall enter into effect on the date that the United States Trade Representative announces in the Federal Register that Mexico has completed its applicable domestic procedures to give effect to corresponding modifications to be applied to goods of the United States and shall, at that time, be effective with respect to goods of Mexico entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date indicated in the Annex to this proclamation.;(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (4)(a) and (b) of this proclamation, this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after March 1, 2007.;(5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.;GEORGE W.

I appreciate your hospitality.;I'm pleased to report, the economy of the United States is strong, and one of the reasons why is because the entrepreneurial spirit of America is strong. And the entrepreneurial spirit of America is represented in this room.;I thank you for the role of the chamber. I appreciate so very much the work you do with our banks to help move capital. I appreciate so very much the fact that you recognize outstanding Latina businesswomen through your Anna Maria Arias Fund. I appreciate the fact that you say loud and clear, el Sueno Americano es para todos.;I strongly believe that the role of government is to make it clear that America is the land of opportunity. I think the best way to do that is to encourage business formation, encourage ownership, is to say, if you work hard and dream big, you can realize your dreams here in America. I also believe it's essential to make sure that when people take risk, that they're able to keep more of their own taxes. Congress needs to make the tax cuts we passed a permanent part of the Tax Code.;I know that in order for us to make sure el Sueno Americano es para todos, that we have an education system that sets high standards for all children, demands accountability in our schools, so that we can say with certainty, children from all backgrounds are able to read and write and add and subtract. That is why I believe it is essential that Congress reauthorize the No Child Left Behind Act.;I think it's very important for us to continue to expand Federal contracting opportunities for small businesses and to make sure that America is a place of promise and hope. It is important and essential that Congress pass comprehensive immigration reform that I can sign into law.;I want to talk about another important priority for our country, and that is helping our neighbors to the south of us build a better and productive life. Thursday, Laura and I are going to leave on a trip that will take us to Brazil and Uruguay and Colombia y Guatemala y por fin, Mexico. [ Laughter ] These are countries that are part of a region that has made great strides toward freedom and prosperity. They've raised up new democracies. They've enhanced and undertaken fiscal policies that bring stability.;Yet despite the advances, tens of millions in our hemisphere remain stuck in poverty and shut off from the promises of the new century. My message to those trabajadores y campesinos is: You have a friend in the United States of America, we care about your plight.;David, thank you very much for being the chairman of this important organization and for the invitation. I want to thank Michael Barrera, who is the president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber. I thank my friend y Tejano Massey Villarreal, who is with us today. Massey, it's good to see you again. You've got a barba crecida. [ Laughter ] Looking good, though, man. I thank Frank Lopez, who is the president and CEO of Chamber Foundation.;I want to thank members of my Cabinet who have come. I think it's a good sign that this administration recognizes the importance of having a neighborhood that is peaceful and flourishing—that we have so many members of the Cabinet who have joined us today. I want to thank Carlos Gutierrez, who's living the—[ applause ]— Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao—Madam Secretary, Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings—Madam Secretary. Thank you all for coming.;Tom Shannon, representing the State Department, Ambassador Randy Tobias, who runs USAID, who, by the way, prior to this assignment, led one of the most important initiatives in my administration that has helped to fight the pandemic of HIV/AIDS. I appreciate your service there, and I now appreciate your service at USAID, Randy. I want to thank John Veroneau, who is with us today, who is the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative.;We've got Members of the United States Congress with us today, powerful Members of the Senate and the House. I am so grateful they are here, starting with Senator Dick Lugar of the great State of Indiana. Appreciate you coming. Norm Coleman from Minnesota—Senator, thank you for being here. A buddy of mine, Jerry Weller, Congressman Weller from Illinois, proud you're here, thanks for coming.;Los Embajadores que estan aqui —the Ambassadors. Thank you all for being here. I see some of the Ambassadors for the countries to which I'll be going. I'm sure all of them are here, and I appreciate you coming. Thanks for your time.;This is an important speech for me today. It's a speech that sets out a direction for this country in regards to our neighborhood. A former President gave such a speech 46 years ago this month. President John Kennedy spoke to ambassadors from across the Americas, this time in the East Room of the White House. He began by citing the early movements of independence in the Latin American Republics. He invoked the dream of a hemisphere growing in liberty and prosperity. That's what he talked about 46 years ago. He proposed a bold new Alliance for Progress to help the countries of this hemisphere meet the basic needs of their people: safe homes and decent jobs and good schools, access to health care.;In the years since President Kennedy spoke, we have witnessed great achievements for freedom in this neighborhood. As recently as a generation ago, this region was plagued by military dictatorship and consumed by civil strife. Today, 34 members of the OAS have democratic constitutions, and only one member country lives under a leader not of its people's choosing.;From New York to Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires and Montreal, we speak different languages, but our democracies all derive their legitimacy from the same source: the consent of the governed. The expansion of freedom has brought our societies much closer. Today, the most important ties between North and South America are not government to government, they are people to people. And those ties are growing.;These ties are growing because of our churches and faith-based institutions, which understand that the call to love our neighbors as ourselves does not stop at our borders. These ties are growing because of our businesses, which trade and invest billions in each other's countries. These ties are growing because of the outreach of our universities, which brings thousands of exchange students and teachers to their campuses. These ties are growing because of the estimated $45 billion that workers in the United States send back to their families in Latin America and the Caribbean each year, one of the largest private economic initiatives in the world.;In all these ways, our two continents are becoming more than neighbors united by the accident of geography, we're becoming a community linked by common values and shared interests in the close bonds of family and friendship. These growing ties have helped advance peace and prosperity on both continents. Yet amid the progress, we also see terrible want. Nearly one out of four people in Latin America lives on less than $2 a day. Many children never finish grade school. Many mothers never see a doctor. In an age of growing prosperity and abundance, this is a scandal—and it's a challenge. The fact is that tens of millions of our brothers and sisters to the south have seen little improvement in their daily lives, and this has led some to question the value of democracy.;The working poor of Latin America need change, and the United States of America is committed to that change. It is in our national interests, it is in the interest of the United States of America to help the people in democracies in our neighborhood succeed. When our neighbors are prosperous and peaceful, it means better opportunities and more security for our own people. When there are jobs in our neighborhood, people are able to find work at home and not have to migrate to our country. When millions are free from poverty, societies are stronger and more hopeful.;So we're helping to increase opportunity by relieving debt and opening up trade, encouraging reform and delivering aid that empowers the poor and the marginalized. And the record of this administration in promoting social justice is a strong record and an important record. Social justice begins with building government institutions that are fair and effective and free of corruption.;In too many places in the Americas, a government official is seen as someone who serves himself at the expense of the public good or serves only the rich and the well-connected. No free society can function this way. Social justice begins with social trust. So we're working with our partners to change old patterns and ensure that government serves all its citizens.;One of the most important changes we're making is the way we deliver aid. We launched a new program called the Millennium Challenge Account, which provides increased aid to nations that govern justly, invest in the education and health of their people, and promote economic freedom. So far, we've signed Millennium Challenge compacts with three Latin American nations. We've also signed an agreement with a fourth country that is working to meet the standards to qualify for a compact on its own. In the coming years, these agreements will provide a total of $885 million in new aid, so long as these countries continue to meet the standards of the Millennium Challenge program. We'll send more as we reach more agreements with other nations.;By the way, this aid comes on top of the standard bilateral assistance that we provide. When I came into office, the United States was sending about $860 million a year in foreign aid to Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year, we nearly doubled that amount, to a total of $1.6 billion. Altogether, thanks to the good work of Members of the United States Congress, we have sent a total of $8.5 billion to the region, with a special focus on helping the poor.;Let me share with you one example of how our aid is working for people in the region. Oh, it's a small example, but it had profound impact. A few years ago, we funded a project to help a town in Paraguay, set up a web site that makes all local government transactions public, from budget spending to employee salaries. The purpose was to help the people of Villarrica improve their local governance through greater transparency. It was a small gesture at first. But when they brought transparency into their government, they discovered that some government employees had used fake receipts to embezzle thousands of dollars from the city government. The mayor informed the public, and the employees who had stolen the money were tried and convicted, and they paid it back. For the people of Paraguay, this was an historic achievement. The local government had called its own officials to account at a public and transparent trial.;The United States can help bring trust to their governments by instilling transparency in our neighborhood. It didn't take much of a gesture, but it had a profound impact.;We're working for similar results in other nations. In El Salvador, we opened one of our international law enforcement academies. The new academy is helping governments in the region build effective criminal justice systems by training law enforcement officers to combat the drug lords and the terrorists and the criminal gangs and the human traffickers. Our efforts to strengthen these civic institutions are also supported by more than government, but by private programs run by U.S. law schools and professional associations and in volunteer organizations.;In the coming months, this administration will convene a White House conference on the Western Hemisphere that will bring together representatives from the private sector and nongovernmental organizations and faith-based groups and volunteer associations. The purpose is to share experiences and discuss effective ways to deliver aid and build the institutions necessary for strong civil society. Is it in our interest we do so? Absolutely, it's in our interests. A transparent neighborhood will yield to a peaceful neighborhood, and that's in the interests of all citizens of our country.;Social justice means meeting basic needs. The most precious resource of any country is its people, and in the Americas, we are blessed with an abundance of talented and hard-working citizens, decent, honorable people who work hard to make a living for their families. But without basic necessities like education and health care and housing, it is impossible for people to realize their full potential, their God-given potential.;Helping people reach their potential begins with good education. That's why the Secretary of Education is here. Many people across the Americas either have no access to education for their children or they cannot afford it. If children don't learn how to read, write, and add and subtract, they're going to be shut off for the jobs of the 21st century. They'll be condemned to a life on the margins, and that's not acceptable.;The United States is working for an Americas where every child has access to a decent school. It is a big goal, but it is a necessary goal, as far as we're concerned. When people in our neighborhood reach their full potential, it benefits the people of the United States. Over the past 3 years, we've provided more than $150 million—in 3 years' time, we spent $150 million for education programs throughout the region, with a special focus on rural and indigenous areas.;Today I announce a new partnership for Latin American youth that's going to build on these efforts. This partnership will devote an additional $75 million over the next years—3 years to help thousands more young people improve their English and have the opportunity to study here in the United States. I think it's good policy when people from our neighborhood come to our country to study.;I hope this warms the heart of our fellow citizens when I share this story. In the mountains of Guatemala, we established a project that helped raise the number of children who complete first grade from 51 percent to 71 percent. In Peru, we helped create the Opening Doors Program to help girls get through grade school. That program is succeeding, and it is self-sustaining. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, our centers of excellence for teacher train-ing—in other words, we've set up these centers, and we've trained 15,000 teachers, nearly 15,000 people have benefited. Does that matter? Of course it matters. When you train a teacher, you're really helping provide literacy for a child.;These teachers have helped improve the literacy skills for nearly 425,000 poor and disadvantaged students. It's important for our fellow citizens and the citizens in our neighborhood to understand that the United States of America is committed to helping people rise out of poverty, to be able to realize their full potential, and that starts with good education. By 2009, we expect to have trained a total of 20,000 teachers through these centers, and reach 650,000 students.;One person who has benefited is a young girl in the Dominican Republic named Lorenny. By the time she was 10, she had been in first grade three times, and she had never passed. When her mother enrolled her in school again, Lorenny said, "Teacher, teach me to read, because I have learning problems." With patience and hard work, this good woman taught Lorenny to read and write. The teacher says that she had watched Lorenny blossom, and that she never would have been able to reach this girl without the know-how acquired through our teacher training program. Societies can change one heart at a time. Here is an example of the good work of the American people taking place in our neighborhood.;Another person who felt the impact of U.S. education assistance is a 25-year-old Mexican named Victor Lopez Ruiz. Victor's family lives in Chiapas, where opportunity is in short supply, and the people tend to speak only the languages of the local communities. Victor's family sold their only real asset, their cattle, to pay for him to learn Spanish and finish high school.;In 2004, Victor won a USAID scholarship, which he used to learn English and study business in international trade at Scott Community College in Bettendorf, Iowa. It must have been quite an experience for a man from Chiapas to head into the heartland. [ Laughter ] But he did so with help from the taxpayers of the United States, for this reason: He goes back to Chiapas, he's working for his bachelor's degree in accounting, and then he's going to start a bakery that will support his family. Where the path for this man once looked grim, education has opened a new door. And as Victor said, "It changed my life.;There are countless of people like Victor and Lorenny across our hemisphere, young people filled with talent and ambition, only needing the chance of an education to unlock their full potential.;Helping people reach their potential includes providing access to decent health care. In many of the same areas where families have no schools, they have no access to medical care. Since I took office, we've spent nearly $1 billion on health care programs in the region, all aimed at sending a message to the people of Latin America: We care for you. Los corazones de las personas aqui in America son grandes. It's in our interests that we get good health care to citizens in our neighborhood.;Today I'm going to announce a new initiative called the Health Care Professional Training Center in Panama that will serve all of Central America. I remember when Secretary Leavitt briefed me on this vital program. The center is going to teach students how to be good nurses and technicians and health care workers. We'll also train people so they can go back to their home countries and teach others these same skill sets.;In all these efforts, it's important for you to understand the role our United States military plays. In June, I'm going to send one of our Navy's medical ships, the Comfort, to the region. The Comfort will make port calls in Belize and Guatemala and Panama, Nicaragua and El Salvador and Peru and Ecuador and Colombia, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. It's going to be busy. Altogether, the Comfort 's doctors and nurses and health care professionals expect to treat 85,000 patients and conduct up to 1,500 surgeries. These are people who need help. These are people who might not otherwise get the basic health care they need to realize a better tomorrow.;The Comfort was also going to partner with the Department of Health and Human Services on a new initiative to provide oral care to the region's poor. Dentists and hygienists will fill cavities and treat infections and provide treatment for the young children.;At the same time, military medical teams will be operating inland to help bring treatment and care to other communities. These teams do everything from vaccinating people against disease to building new medical clinics. The United States military is a symbol of strength for this Nation, but it's also a symbol of the great compassion of the American people and our desire to help those in our neighborhood who need help.;With the deployment of the Comfort and the work of the military teams, we're making it absolutely clear to people that we care. One good example is an area of Nicaragua. Santa Teresa is a rural area where 250 U.S. airmen, soldiers, and marines are now working with 30 members of the Nicaraguan Army to build a medical clinic. Many families in the area live in homes built of scrap wood with dirt floors and doorless entryways. For most of them, a doctor is too far away or too expensive. One man in Santa Teresa says, "The impact of this clinic is going to be tremendous.;I want you to hear the words of a fellow from Nicaragua. He said, "We're so glad you're here. People around here are noticing that the United States is doing something for them." And my message to the man is, we're proud to do so, and we do so because we believe in peace and the dignity of every human being on the face of the Earth.;Helping people reach their potential requires a commitment to improving housing. A strong housing industry can be an engine of economic growth and social stability and poverty reduction. Most Latin American capitals' high prices and high interest rates make good housing hard to afford. So the United States is launching a new effort to help build a market for affordable housing. Through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, we've provided more than $100 million that is being used to help underwrite mortgages to working families in Mexico and Brazil and Chile and the countries of Central America. Now we're going to provide another $385 million to expand these programs and help put the dream of homeownership within the reach of thousands of more people in our neighborhood.;On these three vital social issues—education and health care and housing—we're making a difference across the Americas. You see, by investing in programs and empower people, we will help the working families of our hemisphere build a more hopeful future for themselves.;Finally, social justice requires economies that make it possible for workers to provide for their families and to rise in society. For too long and in too many places, opportunity in Latin America has been determined by the accident of birth rather than by the application of talents and initiative. In his many writings, Pope John Paul II spoke eloquently about creating systems that respect the dignity of work and the right to private initiative. Latin America needs capitalism for the campesino, a true capitalism that allows people who start from nothing to rise as far as their skills and their hard work can take them. So the United States is helping these nations build growing economies that are open to the world, economies that will provide opportunity to their people.;One of the most important ways is by helping to relieve the burden of debt. In the past, many nations in this region piled up debt that they simply cannot repay. Every year, their governments have to spend huge amounts of money just to make interest payments on the debt. So under my administration, we worked with the Group of Eight industrialized nations to reduce the debt of Latin America and Caribbean nations by $4.8 billion. The members of the Inter-American Development Bank are close to an agreement on another debt relief initiative, and we look forward to helping them complete it. This agreement will cancel 3.4 billion owned by some of the poorest countries in our hemisphere: Bolivia and Guyana and Haiti and Honduras and Nicaragua. That works out to about $110 for every man, woman, and child in these countries, monies that their government should use to invest in the education and health of their citizens.;People of this region have the talent and drive they need to succeed. These are hard-working folks. I used to remind people in Texas, family values didn't stop at the Rio Grande River. There's a lot of mothers and dads in our neighborhood who care deeply about whether or not their children can grow up in a hopeful society. What they need is—in order to be able to realize that hope—is better access to capital. The entrepreneurial spirit is strong, strong in this room, and it's strong throughout the region. But what we need is capital.;And so over the past 5 years, the United States has devoted more than $250 million to help the entrepreneurial spirit flourish in our region. This funding includes micro-credit loans for people starting small businesses. And these loans have been very successful, and I appreciate the Congress appropriating money for these microloans.;I'm also directing Secretary Rice and Secretary Paulson to develop a new initiative that will help U.S. and local banks improve their ability to extend good loans to small businesses. It's in our interest that businesses flourish in our own neighborhood. Flourishing businesses provide jobs for people at home. They provide customers for U.S. products.;As we help local entrepreneurs get the capital they need, we're also going to open up new opportunities through trade and investment. If you're a rural farmer scratching out a subsistence living, wouldn't you want to be able to sell your goods to new markets overseas? I think so. You're trying to make a living, and the market is closed— it seems to make sense that you should want to be able to sell into a larger universe.;If you're a worker looking for a job, wouldn't you want more employers competing for your labor? The more employers there are in your neighborhood, the more likely it is you're going to find a better job. That's not really sophisticated math or economics, it just happens to be the truth, la verdad.;When I took office, the United States had trade agreements with only two nations in our hemisphere. We've now negotiated agreements with 10 more. We're working for a strong agreement of the Doha round of global trade talks that will level the playing field for farmers and workers and small businesses in our country and throughout the hemisphere.;Entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the markets we've helped open. Here's an interesting story for you. Mariano Canu, he was an indigenous farmer in Guatemala whose land provided barely enough corn and beans to feed his family. He was scratching to get ahead. No one in his family had ever been to college. Most of the people in his village never got past the sixth grade. Mariano began tilling the fields at age 7. He had spent his life in grinding poverty, and it looked as though his children would suffer the same fate.;Trade helped him a lot, and here's how. To take advantage of new market opportunities, he organized an association of small farmers called Labradores Mayas. These farmers began growing vegetables that they could sell overseas, high-valued crops like lettuce and carrots and celery. They took out a loan. Capital matters. It's important to have capital available if we want our neighbors to be able to realize a better tomorrow. And they built an irrigation system with that loan. And soon they were selling their crops to large companies like Wal-Mart Central America. With the money Mariano has earned, he was able to send his son to college. Today, Labradores is thriving business that supports more than 1,000 jobs in production and transportation and the marketing of internationally sold vegetables.;One of the stops on my trip is going to be to see Mariano. I can't wait to congratulate him on not losing hope and faith. I also look forward to seeing a thriving enterprise that began with one dream, and it's in the interests of the United States to promote those dreams. People like Mariano are showing what the people of this region can accomplish when given a chance. By helping our neighbors build strong and vibrant economies, we increase the standard of living for all of us.;You know, not far from the White House is a statue of the great liberator, Simon Bolivar. He's often compared to George Washington—"Jorge" W. [ Laughter ] Like Washington, he was a general who fought for the right of his people to govern themselves. Like Washington, he succeeded in defeating a much stronger colonial power. And like Washington, he belongs to all of us who love liberty. One Latin American diplomat put it this way: "Neither Washington nor Bolivar was destined to have children of their own, so that we Americans might call ourselves their children.;We are the sons and daughters of this struggle, and it is our mission to complete the revolution they began on our two continents. The millions across our hemisphere who, every day, suffer the degradations of poverty and hunger have a right to be impatient. And I'm going to make them this pledge: The goal of this great country, the goal of a country full of generous people, is an Americas where the dignity of every person is respected, where all find room at the table, and where opportunity reaches into every village and every home. By extending the blessings of liberty to the least among us, we will fulfill the destiny of this new world and set a shining example for others.;Que Dios les bendiga.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Welcoming Ceremony in Guatemala City, Guatemala</td><td class="c6">March 12, 2007</td><td class="c7">President Oscar Berger Perdomo of Guatemala. Dear friends, welcome all. On behalf of my Government and on behalf of the people of Guatemala, I am pleased to welcome President George W. Bush, his wife, and his distinguished delegation in our country.;We celebrate that President Bush decided to include Guatemala in his tour throughout Latin America. We welcome you with affection in this multiethnic and plurilingual country, where—[ inaudible ]— cultures live together, with strong features of modernity, and where, after a lengthy and painful conflict that divided us during 40 years, we are, with determination, following the path of reconciliation, in search for building a plural, democratic, tolerant, and participatory society.;Our historic relationship with the United States of America, at times troubled, date far back. We are pleased to confirm that in recent decades this relationship matured and is today characterized by a further interaction that are respectful and broad in scope.;We share values, including, of course, representative democracy and social justice. We also share interests that grew last year with the entry into force of the free trade agreement between the Central American countries and the Dominican Republic on the one hand, and the United States of America on the other hand.;And we would be remiss if we do not recall that at present it is estimated that approximately 10 percent of our population live in the United States of America, upon the integration of the labor markets of both nations.;As is the case in every mature relationship, once in a while differences of opinion arise, for example, with regard to the issue of migrants, in particularly those who have been deported without clear justification. But as is also the case in every mature relationship, what brings us together exceeds by far those differences. We value that relationship, and we shall make effort in order to enhance and extend it, as we shall make effort to address the differences that we find between us with a constructive spirit.;We shall take advantage of our conversations today, that will take place within a framework of cordiality and openness, to address topics of mutual interest—fighting poverty, respect for human rights, and a frontal fight against organized crime, as well as Central America's economic integration. We shall also review the strengths and weaknesses of our own evolution since the signature of our peace accord.;I finish by reiterating our recognition to President Bush for his persistence in having been able to put forth the free trade agreement, and also for his initiative to promote an integrated migratory reform, that we would trust will culminate with your approval, Mr. President. These two initiatives will certainly contribute to bring our two nations even closer together.;Once again, President Bush, First Lady, Madam Laura Bush, and members of your delegation: Welcome to Guatemala.;President Bush. Senor Presidente, gracias por su bienvenidos a este pais, pais bella. I thank you and the First Lady for treating Laura and me with such grand hospitality. This is my first official visit to Guatemala, and we thank the people of this country for their magnificent hospitality.;I'm honored to stand in the historic courtyard where the 1996 peace accords were signed. The accords mark the end of 36 years of internal conflict and the beginning of a more hopeful future for Guatemala.;Guatemala is a proud country with a rich culture. This morning, Laura and I toured the highlands where the ancient Mayans built a great civilization many centuries ago. This beautiful land is now the home of Central America's largest democracy. You have built a diverse and vibrant nation, and the people of the United States admire your determination and your resilience.;Our two countries share many values. We both believe good governments must be accountable to the people they serve and subject to the rule of law. We both believe free enterprise and hard work help lead to prosperity, and we both believe our nations have a responsibility to spread opportunity and advance the cause of social justice.;The United States and Guatemala are partners in this important work. We're working together to improve access to education and health care to give Guatemalans a safe and legal path to jobs in the United States and to lift millions of people out of poverty by expanding trade. The ties between our two countries have never been stronger or more important.;Mr. President, Laura and I appreciate the invitation to visit your country. We appreciate the time we spent with you and your very accomplished wife. You're a man of vision and courage. You understand that real leadership requires making tough choices that serve your nation well in the long term.;I appreciate your unwavering commitment to your people, Mr. President, and I look forward to working with you to build a better future for both our countries.;Muchas gracias, mi amigo.</td></tr>

Bush: The President's News Conference With President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil at Camp David, Maryland</td><td class="c6">March 31, 2007</td><td class="c7">President Bush. Mr. President, welcome to Camp David. Laura and I are delighted you're here. This is a special spot for Laura and me, and it was my honor to welcome you to this part of America. You come as a friend, we welcome you as a friend, and our discussions were very friendly.;We talked about a lot of areas of mutual concern. We talked about what I would call mutual opportunities. We talked about, of course, trade. Brazil and America trade a lot. Perhaps the most compelling part of the opportunity to work together is for the Doha round. It's in the U.S. interests that we complete the Doha round successfully. It is in—I think it's in Brazil's interests, at least that's the way the President has told me. I don't want to put words in his mouth. But it is in our interest to work together to make sure that we have a deal that treats Brazil fairly, the United States fairly, as well as other nations fairly.;I strongly believe that the best way to help alleviate world poverty is through trade. And so we had yet another constructive dialog. We had a good dialog there in Sao Paulo, and here in Camp David we have as well.;Interestingly enough, we announced the creation of a U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum. It's a opportunity for people in our respective countries to get to know each other better and to strengthen economic ties as well as social ties.;We talked about biofuels. I can remember very well, Mr. President, going to the Petrobras plant. It was an amazing facility, and it was exciting for me to see the realities of your biofuels industry firsthand. I'm a big believer in alternative fuels. There's a whole new industry here in the United States beginning to spring up. And I told the President that not only are we committed domestically to promoting a alternative fuel industry, we're committed to working with Brazil. And that's why we support the President's initiative on the International Biofuels Forum, as well as the initiative that we talked about in Sao Paulo, and signed a memorandum of understanding, and that is to help nations in our own hemisphere realize the benefits of ethanol and biodiesel.;I appreciate the President's very strong commitment to democracy. I also appreciate his very strong commitment to help nations, particularly on the continent of Africa. And one of the really exciting initiatives that we will work together on is an initiative to eradicate malaria in Sao Tome and Principe, two opportunities for Brazil and the United States to work together to improve somebody's life.;There is no excuse for malaria to continuing to kill as many people as it does. Our great nations can work together to stop that death. There is a reasonable plan in place. It's a plan that I'm confident can achieve great success, and it makes a lot of sense for Brazil and the United States to work toward that plan.;As I said in Sao Paulo, Mr. President, I appreciate very much your leadership on Haiti. I appreciate the fact that you've led the U.N. stabilization force. We want to, of course, make sure that your efforts to bring security are followed up by opportunity for the people of Haiti. We don't want your force just to be there to simply stabilize, we want your force to leave—be a part of a constructive future, which is precisely your vision. And we want to work with you very closely to achieve that end.;We spent a lot of time talking about other parts of the world, and that's what you would expect when the United States and Brazil sit at the same table. Brazil is an influential nation, and it's an important nation. And I really do appreciate so very much your sharing your strategic thoughts about not only our own neighborhood but other parts of the world.;And so, Mr. President, it's with great pleasure that I welcome you here. I'm looking forward to giving you a tour of Camp David. We've been spending too much time doing business, now we need to do a little pleasure. And after this press conference, you and I will take a little tour, and then I'll feed you a meal, if you're hungry. [ Laughter ];Welcome.;President Lula da Silva. I hope that it's not too much work. [ Laughter ] Your Excellency, Mr. George W. Bush, the President of the United States, Madam First Lady Laura Bush, Madam Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Ambassador Celso Amorim, and other ministers from Brazil, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Brazilian delegation and the U.S. delegation, newspaper representatives, press representatives: First of all, I would like to thank President Bush for the invitation. My visit to Camp David made it possible for us to cope with issues of global, regional, and bilateral interest.;I believe that on—the 21st century will be marked by changes that we will have to do—to undertake and also for the improvement of the things that we did right in the 20th century. We don't have anymore the cold war amongst us. We don't experience anymore the bipolarity that affected our lives during half a century. And so now we should try to do in the 21st century, make it the century of inclusion of those that are disfranchised in the 20th century—disenfranchised. And I am talking about the less-developed countries in Latin America, of South America, of Africa, and of Asia.;And we also have a subject matter that we have to cope in the 21st century that we did not cope well in the 20th century, and that could pervade our relations for the next years, that is the issue on climate change that affects the planet Earth. Twenty years ago, when we were warned about the problems that we were causing to the world, we used to call—put the blame on those that were making this warning. We criticized them. We said that they were responsible. And we criticized, sometimes, minority groups that went to the streets with their banners and flags, advocating for environmental preservation.;Now has come the time for all the countries in the world to take very seriously climate change and environmental issues. Why so? Because humanity faces one of the major risks in its history. Global warming is a reality that threatens us by land, by the air, and by the water, a dilemma that ironically embraces all of us, no matter where in the planet Earth. The issue is frightening and very concrete and a problem of today. But its solution is still feasible, and part of the solution is in our reach.;We have talked already about this twice. We have talked about biofuels and about our determination in deepening the cooperation in this sector. The memorandum of understanding that was signed in Sao Paulo is the basis of an ambitious partnership that will make it possible for us to confront the major challenges of this century that is now beginning: First of all, the resolution of the energy crisis that affects almost all countries in the world, secondly, the environment protection threatened by the global warming of the planet, and finally, poverty relief and social exclusion with the creation of new jobs and expanding the workers' income and for the poorest workers in the world.;We intend to send our scientists and experts from Brazil to research centers in the U.S. and vice versa. We will create a fund with the support of international agencies, so that we can finance the cooperation with the most needy and interest—countries. We're also committed to the strengthening of the International Biofuel Forum. I invited the United States to participate in an international conference on the issue that Brazil will host in the year 2008.;The concern with the environment is growing in Brazil and in the world and, above all, especially after the latest reports from the U.N. panel on climate change. The stimuli for sustainable production of biofuels is a decisive part of this endeavor to resolve this issue. The biofuels offer, equally, an unique opportunity for the energy democratization of the world to diversify sources of production. We also have obtained good results in different, various areas.;It's important to say to President Bush, here in Camp David, in his residence, that, for me, the biofuel issue is almost like an obsession. I don't know why, but we already have talked about—or heard about biofuels since 1925. Already was mentioned biodiesel in 1943 in Brazil. Nevertheless, since we didn't have the dimension, the scope of the evils that oil could cause, or any other kind of energy matrix to the world—because also, oil was very cheap in those days—this was not taken forward by any country, neither by the automobile industry of any country. And now we are facing a period, a moment, where this new energy matrix can make the world more independent.;It can make the world creating more wealth, because the experience that we have in Brazil is that for each worker that works in a biodiesel plant, it is necessary 1,000 workers in the countryside, which means that we can create millions of jobs for the less-developed countries in the world. That was not foreseen in any paper that was signed by us in the 20th century.;In Brazil, in the last 4 years, we managed to reduce the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest in 52 percent. More than 2 million hectares have been saved. Please pay attention—more than—and carbon gas emissions have been reduced in more than 400 tons, emissions to the atmosphere. And we know that the rainforests are amongst the great victims of climate change. In the negotiations on the Convention on Climate Change, we proposed financial incentives to reduce carbon gas emissions per ton, resulting in further reductions of deforestation. We expect that our proposal would have the support of the international community and obviously—especially, and mainly from the U.S.;We first can establish a partnership either for promoting biofuels, as also in fighting the investigation of the global warming and of deforestation itself, with full respect to the sovereignty of each country.;Brazil has the largest and most important biodiversity on the planet. We have the consciousness of the value that this natural asset represents for our country and for the world. Brazil, with 383 million hectares of arable land, has the capacity to reconcile food production, biofuel production, and the defense of our forests.;Our well-known commitment to fight hunger does not allow us that any activity would cause damage to the food production. I should say—and President Bush knows very well, and I also know—and I believe that all rulers are aware that the world hunger does not result from a lack of food. Rather, it has more to do with the distribution of income and the lack of political will.;Talking with President Bush about the concern of my Government to fight hunger and poverty, I mentioned our concern with the Doha round of the WTO. It is central in our struggle against poverty. And I leave Camp David with the certainty that I've never seen. In all the previous conversations that I had with President Bush or with my Minister of Foreign Affairs—with Condoleezza, Madam Condoleezza Rice— I never have left a meeting between us with so much optimism as I am this way, that I believe that we're getting closer than we have ever been before to reach an agreement during the Doha round of the WTO.;We are trying to conclude with success these trade negotiations. We have urgency in reach and ambitious and balanced agreements. The continuation of agriculture subsidies makes food more expensive and does not stimulate its production in the less-developed countries. Without eliminating subsidies, the opportunity of development represented by biofuels will be lost and, with that, the possibility of the improvement of living conditions of hundreds of millions of lives of men and women.;So that's why it's necessary to eliminate the trade barriers to ethanol, so that we can really reach a true energy commodity. I dream that, at the most, 15 to 20 years from now that the world will surrender to the biofuels. So those that believe in that, they start to invest today and now, because if they leave it for the future, they're going to lag behind and they're going to lose the train and, possibly, they will be lagging behind in the history of modernization.;Dear friends, naturally, I have spoken with President Bush about the Brazilian concern on the limited progress of the U.N. reform. This is where we have more divergence. But in politics, if there's no divergence, if it's not interesting to work with politics, to being politics, but I really wanted, truly, to say to President Bush what was Brazil's view. And President Bush told me what his vision was.;And we reached a conclusion, and certainly, it's not an agreement yet, that the U.N. reform still will have to undertake other reforms that we have to undertake within the U.N. itself so that we can guarantee the U.N. Security Council reform. Since I only have 61 years of age and I have another 4 years of my term, I am convinced that it won't take a long time for us to see this Council changed and the U.N. reformed. I know that it is a highly complex issue, but we cannot postpone it anymore. I am certain that the dialog between our countries will contribute to forward the issue in a much more faster and appropriate way.;We also talked about other issues on the international agenda, as the situation in the Middle East, especially in Lebanon. And maybe many of you don't know—and I told President Bush that—that in Brazil, we have a community of more than 10 million inhabitants of Lebanese and Syrian ancestry. And so that's why we have been trying to attend all the fora that deal with this issue. And within our possibilities, we try to cooperate to rebuild Lebanon. We also have tried to help the construction of a viable Palestinian state while, at the same time, respect Israel's right to exist.;Ladies and gentlemen, we approached important issues in our regional agenda, and I told to President Bush that we have to do more for Haiti. And, in this case, it's interesting to remember that we have reached already agreements not only to work together with Haiti and in Haiti and work together with the Dominican Republic, and work together in countries like Sao Tome and Principe in Africa and in Guinea-Bissau in Africa. And if these experiments are successful, these joint partnerships, this joint work, I believe that we'll have much more room for us to build other projects between the U.S. and Brazil, so that we can help third party countries.;We also agreed that the cooperation with biofuels in Haiti could be decisive to that country. It's not suffice to be the armed forces from Brazil, Chile, Argentina in Haiti, leading the stabilization mission of the U.N. We need to guarantee democracy in Haiti, governance. It's necessary to guarantee their security. But if we don't have development and jobs, all of that will disappear very quickly.;I also told President Bush that Brazil invests firmly in South American integration. I should say, President Bush, this is another thing that I pursued since the first year of my term. If we want to guarantee democracy in South America, if we want to guarantee South American development, if we want to guarantee the strengthening of the institutions in South America, we have to have the consciousness that fiscal integration is a basic addition for the development of the region. And maybe, who knows, the United States can be a partner of Brazil and of other countries in South America in the fiscal integration that we so much are in need. And we understand that this is what will guarantee development for the region and will guarantee democracy, and so will open the opportunities that we did not have years ago for us to develop ourselves.;We are obtaining extraordinary advances vis-a-vis integration, expanding trade, and making all the infrastructure work that we can develop. The bottom line is that we're getting closer ties to our people that were very much far away from each other in the past. And so now we're getting closer, and so that's why I invited President Bush from the U.S. to become a partner in this integration process and building the fiscal integration of our continent.;I also mentioned to President Bush an important role that the United States can play with South American countries that are living in special situations, especially those that need trade preferences. It is extremely important for the U.S. to support these countries that need these trade preferences. We need to support them because this will guarantee the regional stability that is the interest of—to Brazil and all the countries in South America, and certainly, this is the interest of the U.S. too.;Together, we can provide aid to those countries that are still needy, especially in Africa. I have already mentioned the agreement that we signed with Guinea-Bissau and for Sao Tome and Principe.;The challenge, President Bush, in the world of today in trade, in security, in the environment, and fighting poverty are immense. To resolve these issues, there is only one way—is through dialog, with a frank and mutually respectful dialog. That's the only way. With this objective, I have been saying to President Bush that I am willing to gather with him as many times it's necessary, and with all the heads of government around the world as many times would be necessary, so that we can, in the 21st century, arouse a little bit of hope in part of the poorest population in the planet. We have in our hands and our reach the power to do so. We will not do it if we don't wish to do so.;So that's why, before we answer questions from the press with President Bush, I would like to convey to President Bush that, of all the meetings that I participated, meetings with the American Government, this was the meeting that was the most productive one. If someone asked me, "What are you taking back to Brazil," I would say, "Nothing. I'm not taking back anything to Brazil." But certainly, the agreements that we have signed today, the agreements that we can still sign from here onwards, can guarantee in a definite way that the relations between U.S. and Brazil, not only it's necessary, but it is strategic so that we can consolidate a new development model, a new trade policy, and, above all, a new way to cope with the very serious, severe issues that affect the planet.;So for all that, thank you very much.;Department of Justice;Q. Mr. President, the Attorney General's chief of staff testified that Gonzales knew more about the U.S. attorney firings than he let on. Now, how can the American people have confidence in an Attorney General who is not completely forthright? How long does he have to repair the damage? And can the damage be repaired?;President Bush. Attorney General Al Gonzales is an honorable and honest man, and he has my full confidence. He is providing documents for Congress to find the truth. He will testify in front of Congress, and he will tell the truth.;The U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the United States President. I named them to 4-year terms, they served their 4-year terms. And I appreciate their service. I'm sorry that this—these hearings and all this stuff have besmirched their reputation. That's certainly not the intent of anybody in this administration. But I will remind you, there is no credible evidence that there has been any wrongdoing.;Trade;Q. The good will between you gentlemen is very evident. President Lula, it is also evident the effort to advance with the Doha round. If the Doha round has not reached its success, Brazil, does it have a B plan?;President Bush, what is the impediment—or what would be the impediment for the United States to have a bilateral agreement on trade with Brazil?;President Lula da Silva. Well, I have said to all the heads of state in government that I have been in contact and on—to President Bush, to Tony Blair, and to Chancellor Angela Merkel, to Prodi, Prime Minister Prodi, and to President Chirac—with all I have been talking to, I have said that the Doha round is not important only for Brazil, it's not important only for the United States, it's important so that we can guarantee hope around the world, and especially the certainty that we will have more peace in the world.;Brazil is a competitive country in agriculture. Brazil, today, exports—50 percent of its exports are semi-industrialized goods. And so we do have the conditions—competitiveness conditions. President Bush knows, and I know, and I believe that all the leaders know that when we talk about agreements at the WTO, we are making an endeavor at the Doha round—we are working especially so that the less-developed countries could have an opportunity, a chance. Of course, we can improve our relations when Brazil makes decisions about industrialized products or in the service industry. Of course, we could improve when the United States takes a position about what kind of subsidy will be reduced, or the European Union could say if they're going to accept or not agricultural goods— reduce the subsidy so that the markets of the less-developed countries could have market access to Europe.;If we don't reach an agreement, Brazil will continue to follow the path that it's followed: working, producing more, and selling and also buying. But certainly, those that will suffer more will be those don't— that don't even have the opportunity to participate in the meetings that other countries have the power to do so.;I have made these appeals, and I believe that that's why I said, to leaving here, Camp David, I'm leaving here very satisfied because this was an extraordinary and productive meeting, because I heard from— the intention of the American Government on this issue. Our is—we have full willingness, and I believe that if we work together, the U.S. and Brazil, to try to convince our European partners—I believe that we can reach an agreement.;And I believe that, in this case, there's no B plan. Either we have the A plan, or there's no agreement. And if there's no agreement, certainly, we will not have winners or losers, everybody will lose. Everybody will lose, the rich, because they will be liable for what will happen in a poorest world.;President Bush. All our trade discussions have centered on completing Doha. It's the only discussions I've had with the President. I've been asked about plan B's before, on different subjects. And that kind of means you're willing to retreat. I'm a plan-A man, just like the President is. Let's get the job done.;And for the United States, we're willing to reduce our agricultural subsidies in a substantial way. We understand. On the other hand, we expect our goods and services—whether they be agricultural goods or manufactured goods and services—to be given access to markets. The interesting thing is, is that Brazil is a strong exporter, and it's in Brazil's interest that their goods and services be—have access to markets as well.;This is a difficult negotiations because there's a variety of interests. And step one is—to be successful in this complex negotiations, is there a genuine desire to succeed? In other words, are people just showing up for the sake of showing up, or are people actually coming to the table with a genuine desire to succeed? I assured the President again that the United States has a genuine desire to succeed in these talks. I do, because I believe that, one, I think the world has a tendency, at times, to become isolationist and protectionist. In other words, there's that movement, that isolationist movement can become prevalent. And if that were to happen, it would make the world a lot more unstable, and it would make the world more poor.;I'm going to repeat what I told you earlier: Ours is a very compassionate nation. We deeply care about the human condition around the world. And I firmly believe that the best way to alleviate world poverty is through trade. That's what I believe. It's not the only way, but it is the best start— let me put it to you that way—coupled with health initiatives that we're working on, food initiatives that the President described. But if you're genuinely interested in eliminating poverty—and I am—commerce, trade, opportunity, and hope will all flourish with a completion of the Doha round.;So we are seriously involved. Now, what we won't do is accept a unilateral deal. And the President has never asked us to do that, that's not his intention. His intention is, we want to work together to make sure all are treated fairly. I certainly hope that's the case with the rest of our potential trading partners and our negotiating partners, that they don't expect the United States to carry the entire load in making sure the agreement moves forward.;And so we strategized together. Our— the ministers will talk a lot. Ambassador Schwab stayed behind in Sao Paulo to converse with her counterparts. There is a lot of work going on. And I believe there's a good chance we can complete the round. And so therefore, your plan B will be irrelevant—[ laughter ]—I hope.;Environment/British Military Personnel Held in Iran;Q. Jennifer Griffin of FOX News. Mr. President, the Iranian hostage crisis has just entered its ninth day—passed its ninth day. Would the British be within their rights to consider a military option if the crisis drags on? And would the U.S. have considered it an act of war if it had been U.S. sailors and marines who had been taken? And would you consider trading the five Iranians who were captured in Irbil back in January if it would help resolve the crisis?;And, Mr. President, did you see eye to eye with the President on global warming? Would you say that you two agree that global warming is a problem? Thank you.;President Bush. Let me start with global warming. One reason you promote alternative fuels is to be better stewards of the environment. Many of the greenhouse gases come from tailpipes of automobiles. And therefore, when you get away from gasoline and start using ethanol or biofuels, you make a significant step toward improving the environment—just to make sure I'm on the record here.;The Iranian issue is a serious issue. It's serious because—or the British hostages issue is a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out of Iraqi water. And it's inexcusable behavior. And I strongly support the Blair Government's attempts to resolve this peacefully, and I support the Prime Minister when he made it clear there were no quid pro quos. The Iranians must give back the hostages. They're innocent, they were doing nothing wrong, and they were summarily plucked out of water. And it is—as I say, it's inexcusable behavior.;President Lula da Silva. Well, I believe that we are in agreement in relationship to the policies that we have to undertake so that we should be more careful and take better care of the environment. And on the climate change issues discussions, we have common interests. What happens is that—to know the timing and what to do. Now, in the case of Brazil, we already have 25 percent of ethanol—or better saying, 23 percent of ethanol blended, or as a blender, in gasoline for a long time. And now we have a flex-fuel engine, a car moved by flex-fuel engine that can use 100 percent of gas or 100 percent of ethanol or 50 percent of alcohol, 50 percent of ethanol as blender.;So this is the road that—where we can start to depollute. And then it's not only the ethanol issue or the biofuel issue, there is also the electrical hydropowerplants. We also have to have the responsibility on us to build thermal plants based on coke, moved by coke—moved by coal—I'm sorry. And so it's essential that the company should invest more in reducing gas emissions.;So the fact of the matter is the following: That the climate change issue today is a severe disease. There's no social sector that it doesn't reach. It will reach all the planet as a whole. There's no way for us to escape. So we have not managed yet to reach Mars, and Moon is not a proper place for us to live. So either we take care of planet Earth very carefully, as we take care of our sons, or all of us will regret that in the future. And although, those already my age—I'm with 61 years of age, but I have grandsons, and I want to have grand-grandsons, and so I want them to have the pride that their grandfather helped to build a better world, better than I received from my father.;So I believe that all of us will reach an agreement, that it's necessary and very much so the responsibility and liability, in the discussions on climate issues than we have had up until today. The evil is facing us, and we see the evil, and we feel the evil, but there's no way that we can turn our back to that.;Iran;Q. The American Government, last week, have manifested a lot of concern with the investments of some foreign companies in the oil industry in Iran. And in this week, the American Ambassador in Brazil made it very clear that this concern also extends to Petrobras investments that Petrobras considers strategic. So I'd like to ask President Lula if, in his assessment, Petrobras should continue to make businesses with Iran or should get away from Iran, like the United States would like us all to do?;So—and I would like to ask President Bush, why does the United States want Petrobras to be out of Iran if the country has fulfilled all its sanctions that was approved—passed by the U.N.?;President Lula da Silva. Well, I am convinced that Petrobras will continue to invest in oil prospection in Iran. Iran has been an important trade partner for Brazil. They buy from us more than $1 billion, and they don't almost sell anything to us. So I'm an advocate that trade, fair trade is the trade that you buy and sell. You sell and buy, you can't just sell.;And then there's also political issues in each country. Each country faces their own domestic issues. But up until now, Iran has not been a victim of any sanction that was proposed by the U.N. I know that there's political divergence on this between Iran and other countries, but with Brazil, we have no political divergence with them, so we will continue to work together with Iran on what is of the interest of Brazil. I don't see any major issue to do it in a different way.;President Bush. Every nation makes the decisions that they think is best in their interest. Brazil is a sovereign nation, he just articulated a sovereign decision. And as you mentioned, the trade that you were discussing was not in violation of any U.N.—in any U.N. mandate.;Our position is that we would hope that nations would be very careful in dealing with Iran, particularly since Iran is trying to develop a nuclear weapon, and a major threat to world peace is if the Iranians had a nuclear weapon. And that is why there are sanctions imposed at the United Nations, as a result of collaboration between the United States, EU, China, and Russia, to make it clear to the Iranian regime that there is a better way forward other than isolation.;We have no problems with the Iranian people. As a matter of fact, the United States highly respects the people of Iran. We respect the history of Iran, we respect the rich traditions of Iran. We, however, are deeply concerned about an Iranian Government that is in violation of international accords in their attempt to develop a nuclear weapon. And therefore, whatever comments you hear reflect that concern. And we will continue to work with the international community to say that it is in the world's interest that Iran not develop a weapon. It is in the interest of peace that they not develop a weapon.;And I'm hopeful that the people of Iran will be tired of the isolation. I would hope that there would be some rationality amongst their leaders in choosing a better way forward for the people. They're depriving their people of a lot of opportunity.;Now, having said that, the United States does believe that it's in our interest that we have people-to-people exchanges. As I say, we have no problem with the Iranian people. As a matter of fact, we just sent a wrestling team to Iran, all attempting to make it clear to the Iranian people that we're interested in having a constructive relationship. And it is the decisions of their Government that are preventing that from happening.;Thank you. Good job.</td></tr>

Bush resolved to continue deepening the strategic dialogue between Brazil and the United States, as reflected in the determination to increase bilateral cooperation based on the shared values of democracy, human rights, cultural diversity, trade liberalization, multilateralism, environmental protection, defense of international peace and security, and promotion of development with social justice.;The Presidents welcomed the strengthening of the partnership between the two countries in the area of renewable energy with the Memorandum of Understanding to Advance Cooperation on Biofuels, signed in Sao Paulo on March 9, 2007. The Presidents noted with satisfaction the results of the meeting on implementation of the Memorandum, held in Washington on March 29. They expressed their governments' intention to arrange for Brazilian scientists and researchers to visit state-of-the-art biofuels research laboratories in the United States, as well as visits to Brazil by senior officials of the United States Departments of Energy, State, and Agriculture in Spring 2007. The United States and Brazil recognized the support of institutions including the IDB, the United Nations Foundation, and the Organization of American States. Brazil and the United States plan to begin efforts to work together, initially, with Haiti, the Dominican Republic, St. Kitts and Nevis, and El Salvador, and to pursue consultations with other countries interested in participating in the cooperation program.;The Presidents noted with satisfaction the growth of bilateral trade and investments between the United States and Brazil. They reaffirmed their intention to use the ongoing "Commercial Dialogue" to seek ways to promote innovation and increase trade opportunities, particularly for small- and medium-sized enterprises, as well as to protect intellectual property rights. The Heads of State noted the formation of the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum to engage directly with leaders in the business community to discuss economic and trade-related topics. They applauded plans by United States Council on Competitiveness and Brazilian Competitiveness Movement to stage an "Innovation Summit" in Brasilia in July 2007 to support greater competitiveness and innovation. The Presidents agreed to direct their governments to explore initiatives in the area of tourism, including examining the possibility of increasing flights between Brazil and the United States, with particular attention to Northeast Brazil.;The Presidents applauded the March 20, 2007 signing in Brasilia of an Agreement for the Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes. The Presidents expressed hope that the signing of this Agreement will be the first step toward cooperation between the Brazilian Federal Revenue Secretariat and the Internal Revenue Service. They pledged to redouble ongoing work toward the conclusion of an agreement on double taxation.;The Presidents noted with satisfaction the progress achieved since their November 2005 meeting in Brasilia, including the first-ever convening of the bilateral Joint Commission on Science and Technology on July 21, 2006, and the launch of a Commercial Dialogue between the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade and the U.S. Department of Commerce.;The Presidents welcomed the strengthened partnership in education through the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding in this area. They applauded the immediate start-up of its implementation with the launch of a program targeting increased professional and technological education in Brazil and bilateral exchange in an effort to include increasing numbers of young people and adults in the labor market.;The Presidents expressed their support for cooperation with African countries. They applauded the trilateral cooperation to strengthen the Legislative Branch of Guinea-Bissau, as established in the March 30 Memorandum of Understanding. The Presidents also discussed the possible broadening of such cooperative efforts to include other interested African countries. The two Presidents announced a specific commitment to cooperate on a plan to eradicate malaria in Sao Tome and Principe. They also agreed to explore cooperation in combating malaria, tuberculosis, and neglected diseases, especially in Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa such as Angola and Mozambique, and to confront the threat of avian flu, building on their cooperation on HIV/AIDS in Mozambique and Angola.;The Presidents recognized that the success of international action in Haiti depends on simultaneous activities to achieve security, political reconciliation, and socioeconomic development. They intend to act within the United Nations framework to increase multilateral cooperation in Haiti and welcomed efforts to identify areas of mutual cooperation in support of stability and economic development in Cite Soleil. They applauded the success of efforts by Brazil and the United States, in cooperation with other countries in the region, to secure United Nations Security Council renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) last February.;The Presidents sought to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the area of public safety, particularly in combating organized crime, drug trafficking, and money laundering, and in preventing terrorism and terrorism financing, with emphasis on information sharing between intelligence units and on the establishment of mechanisms for recovering assets resulting from transnational crimes.;The Heads of State reaffirmed global economic growth and development as the main objectives of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO). They underscored the importance of continuing to constructively engage negotiators, which facilitated the resumption of the negotiations. The Presidents pledged to work together toward a successful conclusion, taking advantage of the window of opportunity opened in 2007. They emphasized that the agreement should be ambitious and balanced, with a view to both an appreciable increase in market access and in global trade flows, and a significant reduction in global poverty rates.;The Presidents reaffirmed the importance of reform of the United Nations to make the organization better able to deal with today's complex international agenda. They further reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate closely on the issue of Security Council reform.</td></tr>

As the expansion of freedom continues in our region, the democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere are working together to build a safer and more prosperous society and to ensure that all the people of the Americas have the opportunity to achieve their dreams.;My Administration is working to advance the cause of social justice in the Pan American region, and we are committed to supporting our neighbors' efforts to meet the needs of their citizens. In 2004, we created the Millennium Challenge Corporation to provide increased aid to nations that govern justly, invest in the education and health of their people, and promote economic freedom. We are working with the citizens of the Pan American community to expand economic opportunity through debt relief and to encourage reforms through such mechanisms as the North America Free Trade Agreement, the Chile Free Trade Agreement, and the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement. These agreements facilitate the flow of trade and help establish market economies. We have also recently notified the Congress of our intention to enter into a free trade agreement with Panama and signed free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia. These agreements will generate export opportunities for the United States and benefit the people of Panama, Peru, and Colombia by providing economic opportunity and helping to strengthen democratic institutions. By working with our democratic neighbors to build strong and vibrant economies, we are helping the citizens of the Western Hemisphere realize the promise of a free and just society.;The ties between the democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere are deep and lasting, and together we can continue our great strides toward freedom and prosperity for people everywhere.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2007, as Pan American Day and April 8 through April 14, 2007, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-first.;GEORGE W. BUSH</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks at a Reception for Black Music Month</td><td class="c6">June 22, 2007</td><td class="c7">Thank you all. Please be seated. Thank you. Rachel, thank you. Thanks for coming, thanks for the introduction, and thanks for representing the United States. Proud to have you here.;I want to welcome you all right here to the people's house. I'm pleased you could join us for this annual celebration of Black Music Month. This is an event I've always looked forward to. It's a chance to listen to some good music—[ laughter ]— and to be with some good friends. It's an opportunity for us to thank artists whose work inspire our country. And so thanks for coming. I hope you enjoy the day as much as I do.;I appreciate the fact that Alphonso is with us, Alphonso Jackson and Marcia. He's the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Dr. Dorothy Height is with us. I'm proud you're here, Dr. Height. Thanks for joining us. My friend Bob Johnson has joined us. He knows a little something about black entertainment. [ Laughter ] Thanks for coming. Roslyn Brock, vice chairman of the NAACP—I'm proud you're here, Roslyn. Thank you for coming. Thanks for joining us. Dyana Williams, president of the International Association of African American Music Foundation—she knows something about music. [ Laughter ] I appreciate Kevin Liles, executive vice president of the Warner Music Company. Thank you for coming—and Jonathan Platt, senior vice president of EMI Music Publishing and Virgin Records. Appreciate you all being here. Thanks for coming.;Most of all, thank you all. Thanks for taking time out of your day to come. One of the best things about living here is that some of the best musicians come to play. [ Laughter ] It's amazing what kind of talent you can draw here at the White House. [ Laughter ];And over the years, American Presidents have seen some fantastic African American musicians here on the White House stage. President Chester Arthur—you might remember Chester—[ laughter ]—he welcomed the first black choir to perform at the White House, the Jubilee Singers from Fisk University. President Benjamin Harrison hosted one of the first black soloists to play at the White House, Sissieretta Jones, who was the daughter of a slave. President William Howard Taft invited Joseph Douglass—grandson of Frederick Douglass—to perform here. Franklin Roosevelt hosted the great Marian Anderson, when she performed "Ave Maria" for the King and Queen of England. President Ronald Reagan hosted Mikhail Gorbachev and invited the legendary Pearl Bailey to entertain. And he—when he introduced her, he just simply said—simply, "our Pearl"—"welcome, our Pearl." [ Laughter ] I hope the translator got that right. [ Laughter ];And Laura and I had some incredible entertainers and Americans sing for us and our friends. We've had Eartha Kitt, Patti Austin, B.B. King, Irwin Mayfield, Aaron Neville, just to give you a taste of what happens here at the White House. Each of the performers has inspired people across the world with their talents, and each performer has brought great pride to the United States. It's really a great country that can produce a diverse group of musicians that can serve as ambassadors about what's right about America.;And we're proud to welcome some new musicians here to the White House today. We're just keeping in a long trend of Presidents who have welcomed some of our great musicians here to the White House. So as we honor Black Music Month, it makes sense to bring some talent here to entertain us.;Karina Pasian grew up in New York City. She's the child of immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Her parents are both teachers in the New York Public School System, and early on, it became clear that Karina had an incredible gift for music. At age 3—that's the definition of "early on"—[ laughter ]—she was singing and studying piano. By age 12, she was performing at the Coliseum in Rome before a television audience of more than a half-million people, alongside Alicia Keys and Stevie Wonder and Andrea Bocelli. Today, she's 15 years old. She's already recorded her first album.;And despite her young age, she tackles very mature issues with her music. She sings about hunger and disease in Africa and the genocide in Darfur. And we appreciate that clarity, appreciate her bringing these issues to focus to help more people understand that the world's got to do something about it now, before it's too late. I will tell you, the—America is in the lead when it comes to HIV/AIDS on the continent of Africa, we're on the lead when it comes to feeding the hungry, we're on the lead when it comes to eradicating malaria. And that's where we need to be, and that's where we will stay. And I appreciate very much Karina bringing this issue to focus. We're proud that you're here, and we're proud that you brought your big heart to this stage.;We're also going to welcome Kem Owens, who learned to love music growing up in Detroit listening to R&amp;B greats. He listened to them on his mom and dad's radio. He taught himself to play piano at the home of his Baptist minister-grandfather. But as a teenager, this good man lost his way. He became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and, eventually, he became homeless. Today he finds a home, a warm home to welcome him. He was sleeping on the ground near a building on the Detroit River, and he said this: God found him and inspired him to set his life straight. With the help of the Almighty, he overcame his addictions and he rediscovered his passion for music. In 2001, he used a credit card to finance the production of an independent CD he called "Kemistry." Get it—Kem Owens? [ Laughter ] Kemistry? [ Laughter ];The disc sold 10,000 copies in 5 months. It caught the attention of music executives in New York who signed Kem to a major label deal. He has gone on to become one of America's most popular R&amp;B singers. But he knows the audience he's truly playing for. He says, quote, "I want my life to be one that God will be pleased with. I'm by no means a saint." I know what you're saying, Kem. [ Laughter ] But he went on to say: "My eye is on the prize. He's not done with me yet." We're proud to welcome such a man to the White House today.;And finally, Tourie and Damien Escobar discovered their love for the violin in the third grade, and soon found themselves studying classical music at New York's finest conservatories. But they grew up in a tough neighborhood, and soon Tourie and Damien had dropped their music, dropped out of school, and fallen in with a bad crowd. Yet their mother and aunt never gave up hope. And with their encouragement and prayers, these two brothers returned to the music they loved.;They formed a group called Nuttin' But Stringz, performing a new music fusion that bridges classical, R&amp;B, and rap. I'm looking forward to it. [ Laughter ] They started by playing on subways and went on to win amateur music contests at the Apollo Theater. And last month, they released their first album. Here's what Tourie says: "The passion for music and the violin saved my life." And today that passion has brought these talented musicians right here to the White House.;All these artists represent the best of our country. They represent hope and hard work. We're looking forward to hearing them perform. They're going to be in a long list of performers who have come here to be able to entertain the country, to lend their musical talents to this, the people's house.;I appreciate them coming to help us celebrate Black Music Month. I appreciate you all joining to help celebrate Black Music Month. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless our country.</td></tr>

Bush: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2008</td><td class="c6">September 14, 2007</td><td class="c7">Presidential Determination No. 2007-33;Memorandum for the Secretary of State;Subject: Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2008;Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228)(FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.;A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographical, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Burma and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are justifications for the determinations on Burma and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B). I have also determined, in accordance with the provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions is vital to the national interests of the United States.;Although President Karzai has strongly attacked narcotrafficking as the greatest threat to Afghanistan, one third of the Afghan economy remains opium-based, which contributes to widespread public corruption, damage to licit economic growth, and the strengthening of the insurgency. The government at all levels must be held accountable to deter and eradicate poppy cultivation, remove and prosecute corrupt officials, and investigate and prosecute or extradite narcotraffickers and those financing their activities. We are concerned that failure to act decisively now could undermine security, compromise democratic legitimacy, and imperil international support for vital assistance.;In Afghanistan, one model for success can be drawn by comparing the marked differences in cultivation between the northern and southern provinces. Several northern provinces contributed to a decline in poppy cultivation resulting from a mixture of political will and incentives and disincentives, such as public information, alternative development, and eradication. Furthermore, several northern provinces with very low amounts of poppy are well on their way to becoming poppy free.;Despite the significant progress made in Afghanistan since 2001, the country continues to face tremendous challenges. Our struggle to win hearts and minds, while confronting the insurgency, continues to directly hinge on our ability to help the Afghan government produce visible results. We need to encourage a firm belief among the Afghan people that their national government is capable of delivering an alternative to the preceding decades of conflict. Our reconstruction assistance is an essential instrument to achieve that goal.;Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation has been uneven. The Bolivian government has cooperated closely on interdiction, and operations and seizures have reached record levels. The government is on track to reach 5,600 hectares of eradication this year, surpassing its goal of 5,000 hectares.;However, these measures have been outstripped by replanting and expansion of cultivation in Bolivia, the world's third-largest producer of coca. The Government of Bolivia's policy of "zero cocaine, but not zero coca" has focused primarily on interdiction, to the exclusion of its other essential complements, especially coca crop eradication. We strongly encourage the Government of Bolivia to make its number one priority the reduction and eventual elimination of excess coca crops, a major source of illegal cocaine for the hemisphere, Europe, the United States, and increasingly, for Bolivian citizens. In the area of drug control policy development, we urge the Government of Bolivia to revamp its national drug control strategy to eliminate permissiveness in licit cultivation, to abolish the so-called "cato" exemption, and to tighten controls on the sale of licit coca. As a party to the three major United Nations drug conventions, we urge Bolivia to move quickly to adopt and implement a modern anti-money/counterterrorism financing law, and take concrete steps to strengthen and better enforce precursor chemical controls and its asset forfeiture regime.;The United States enjoys close cooperation with Canada across a broad range of law enforcement issues. We remain concerned that the production of high-potency, indoor-grown marijuana for export to the United States continues to thrive in Canada in part because growers do not consistently face strict legal punishment. The marijuana industry in Canada is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with organized crime groups relying on marijuana sales as the primary source of income and using profits to finance other illegal activities. The production of synthetic drugs such as MDMA/ Ecstasy and methamphetamine, some of which are exported to the United States, appears to be on the rise in Canada. The Government of Canada has made a serious effort to curb the diversion of precursor chemicals that are required for methamphetamine production to feed domestic and U.S. illegal markets and has worked productively with the United States in joint law enforcement operations that disrupted drug and currency smuggling operations along both sides of the border.;The Government of Ecuador has made considerable progress in combating narcotics trafficking destined for the United States. However, a dramatic increase in the quantity of cocaine transported toward the United States using Ecuadorian-flagged ships remains an area of serious concern. Effective cooperation and streamlined maritime operational procedures between the U.S. Coast Guard and Ecuadorian Navy are resulting in an increase in the amount of cocaine interdicted. Building on that cooperation, we will work with Ecuador to change the circumstances that make Ecuadorian-flagged vessels and Ecuadorian citizenship so attractive to drug traffickers.;Guinea-Bissau is becoming a warehouse refuge and transit hub for cocaine traffickers from Latin America transporting cocaine to Western Europe. Narcotics traffic is becoming yet another hurdle for Guinea-Bissau as it emerges from civil conflict. International donors and organizations are working to encourage and assist Guinea-Bissau in its efforts to confront organized cocaine trafficking networks that would use the country for warehousing and transshipment. These efforts are certainly appropriate and should be supported and advanced to deter illegal drug activities in Guinea-Bissau.;India has an exemplary record on controlling its licit opium production and distribution process, despite formidable challenges to its efforts. The Government of India can be correctly proud of its diligent law enforcement agencies and the introduction of high-tech methods, including "Smart Cards" for each licensed opium farmer. Recently, Indian enforcement officials identified and destroyed substantial illicit opium poppy cultivation in areas thought to be free of illicit cultivation in the past. Indian officials will want to investigate the circumstances of this surprisingly large illicit cultivation to identify those behind this disquieting phenomenon and arrest, prosecute, and convict them.;Nigeria has made progress on many narcotics control and anti-money laundering benchmarks. There is reason to be hopeful. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has seized millions in the proceeds of crime, anti-money laundering efforts have been successful, and Nigeria is cooperating with the international community to improve its efforts against money laundering even more. Still necessary are procedural reforms to streamline extradition procedures. For many narcotics criminals no sanction is more effective than the fear they could face a court and jail time in the countries to which they have trafficked narcotics. Nigeria should also re-double its efforts to use its frequent apprehension of street criminals and couriers to identify and prosecute major drug traffickers.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Remarks at a Reception Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month</td><td class="c6">October 10, 2007</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you all. Please be seated. Sientese. Gracias. Bienvenidos a la Casa Blanca, tambien el jardin de las rosas. It's a beautiful day. I'm glad you're here. Thanks for coming as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. Every year at this time, we recognize the rich cultural traditions of the Hispanic American community and the great contributions of Hispanic Americans to our country and our character. That's why we're here.;I appreciate so very much Ambassador Sue Schwab, who is the U.S. Trade Representative, for joining us. We're proud you're here, Madam Ambassador. I'm going to say something positive about trade, so I'm glad you came. I appreciate my friend—my dear friend former Attorney General of the United States Al Gonzales. I appreciate Anna Cabral, U.S. Treasurer, and Victor. Thank you all for coming. I'm proud that other members of my administration have joined us. Sarah, it's good to see you, thank you for being here.;I thank my friend Emilio Estefan, who has provided the entertainment. I'm going to say something about the entertainment a little later, but Israel, we're glad you're here.;I appreciate the members of the diplomatic corps. I appreciate the Ambassadors coming. We're proud you're here. Thanks for taking time.;I have just met a remarkable woman that I want to introduce to you. Yamile Llanes Labrada and her daughter Shirlen Garcia have joined me in the Oval Office. Yamile is the wife of a political prisoner in Cuba, Dr. Jose Luis Garcia Paneque. The doctor was a plastic surgeon. He did nothing more than advocate for freedom, and he's now in prison. And not only is he in prison, he's ill. And so one of the messages I have for the Cuban leader is, free this man and free other political prisoners. He's not a threat to you. Let him be reunited with a woman who loves him dearly and his four children. So, Yamile, thanks for coming. We're proud you're here. Sure glad you're here. Y que Dios les bendiga a su familia y tambien su esposo.;Citizens of Hispanic descent are the fastest growing population in America. Hispanic Americans strengthen our Nation with their commitments to familia y fe. Hispanic Americans enrich our country with their talents and creativity and hard work. Hispanic Americans are living the dream that has drawn millions to our shores, and we must ensure that the American Dream remains available for all. It's an important part of our past, and it's a central part of our future that people from all walks of life feel welcomed and given the opportunity to realize the blessings of America.;Realizing the promise of this good country requires a good education. You know, I worked hard with Republicans and Democrats to pass what's called the No Child Left Behind Act. That's an important piece of legislation because it raises standards and it holds schools to account. And the law is working. It's a good piece of legislation. It's working because I can report to you that last month, we saw the results from what's called the Nation's Report Card. The Report Card showed record performance in fourth and eighth grade math and fourth grade reading. And the report showed that Hispanic students scored alltime highs in a number of areas. And so we need to build on that progress. It's good that we've got a good report card, we want excellent report cards for every child.;I met yesterday with civil rights leaders. See, I believe a good education is a civil right. And we talked about how we can work together to make sure the No Child Left Behind Act is not only reauthorized but is made stronger. The Congress needs to make sure we don't lower standards. Congress needs to make sure we raise standards and hold people to account, so that every child, every child can learn in the United States of America.;Realizing the promise of America requires a growing economy. Last week, we got more good news on this front. The economy added 110,000 new jobs in September, giving us 49 straight months of job growth, and that's a new record. We are now enjoying the longest period of uninterrupted job creation in the history of the United States. The growing economy is the result of good policies, like low taxes, but it's also mainly the result of hard work of workers and entrepreneurs, including hundreds of thousands of Latino businessowners.;And so to keep the economy growing, we've got to make sure we don't raise your taxes. And to keep the economy growing, we've got to open new markets for goods and services. One of the most important markets is in our own hemisphere. Many Hispanic-owned businesses in our country depend on trade with Latin America. Trade with the region strengthens ties of friendship and commerce. Free trade helps our neighbors prosper.;And so to expand trade with Latin America, we negotiated—and Congress approved—a free trade agreement with five Central American countries as well as the Dominican Republic. And this agreement is working. It's helped American workers. It's new markets for products made here, right here in the United States. And it's helped our neighbors. We want everybody to do well in our neighborhood. We want prosperity to abound.;And that's why we've negotiated new free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia and Panama. For the sake of our businesses and sake of our workers and for the sake of prosperity in the neighborhood, the United States Congress needs to approve these three very important trade agreements.;Realizing the promise of the country requires strong communities where people care for each other in times of need. Yamile found help in the United States from people who care about the condition of her husband. A total stranger that didn't know Yamile before she came to the United States said, how can I help you, what can I do? That happens all across our country when Hispanic Americans run soup kitchens and drug treatment clinics and hear the call—God's call—to love our neighbors as we'd like to be loved ourself.;We see this spirit in Hispanic Americans who volunteer as Little League coaches or serve as Big Brothers and Big Sisters or give their time and energy to improve the lives of people that live across the street from them. By caring for others, Hispanic Americans make ours a better and more compassionate nation, and America appreciates the example they set.;Finally, realizing the promise of America requires a secure country. We honor the many Hispanic Americans who wear the uniform here at home, the police and firefighters and emergency rescue personnel who risk their lives each day to protect our homeland and our communities. And we honor the 200,000 Hispanic Americans who serve in our Armed Forces, who are working to spread liberty so we can be secure here in America, who are doing the hard work today so our children and grandchildren can grow up in peace. I appreciate the fact that they have volunteered in a time of danger, and I'm proud to welcome members of the United States military with us today. Thank you all for coming.;So during Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate the diversity that makes our country stronger and the heritage and the spirit that Hispanic Americans bring to this great democracy. To help us celebrate the heritage and spirit, we have an incredible talent, Cachao. He was born in Havana only in 1918. That was before my time. During the late 1930s, he helped popularize the mambo, and over the past half century, he has won a lot of Grammy Awards—most recently in 2005, believe it or not. So if you do the math, you can figure out this man hasn't stopped working. [ Laughter ] He's still clicking, and he's still making good music. And so we're proud to welcome Israel Lopez, better known as Cachao, to here—to the White House. Thank you for coming, sir.;[ At this point, Israel Lopez performed. ];The President. I know you'll join me in thanking Cachao for coming. Guess when the first he was here, 1948 he played for President Harry Truman. Welcome back. We're sure glad you're here.;Thank you all for coming. I want you to say hello to Yamile again una mas vez. We certainly pray for the speedy release of your husband, and we're glad you're here at the White House. No better place to come and recognize the great beauty of freedom. And we want to thank you all for joining us as we celebrate the great diversity and freedom of the United States.;Que Dios les bendiga. Thank you.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks in Miami, Florida</td><td class="c6">October 12, 2007</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you for the warm welcome. It's great to be in Miami. I've been looking for my little brother. [ Laughter ] He must have finally found work. I thank—[ laughter ]. Just kidding, Jeb.;I thank the Center for Hemispheric Policy and the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce for sponsoring this event. And I appreciate you all coming. I appreciate the support that you give for enterprise here in south Florida.;I know you know that—as business leaders and foreign policy thinkers, that one of the pivotal issues facing our country is expanding trade and investment. And that's what I want to talk to you about today. And it's a timely message because Congress has some important decisions coming up. I've made up my mind about the importance of trade and investment, and now Congress is going to have to make up its mind about trade and investment, especially when it comes to free trade agreements with Peru, Panama, and Colombia.;These agreements will level the playing fields for businesses, workers, and farmers here in the United States. These agreements will help our friends in neighborhoods, and help them lift them out of poverty. These agreements will counter the false populism promoted by some nations in the hemisphere. These agreements will strengthen the forces of freedom and democracy throughout the Americas. I urge the congressional leaders to pass these three Latin American agreements as soon as possible.;And I appreciate you giving me a chance to come here and explain why they're important.;I want to thank my friend Senator Mel Martinez for introducing me. I appreciate his willingness to serve in the United States Senate. I know this is a nonpartisan meeting, but let me just tell you, he's doing a fine job.;I want to thank three members from the congressional delegation who are here, the Diaz-Balart boys—Lincoln and Mario—as well as Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. I'm honored you all are here. Thanks for coming.;I appreciate so very much Manny Diaz for joining us today. Mr. Mayor, I'm honored you are here. I thank you for your time. I want to thank the other State— [ applause ]—thank the State and local officials who have joined us. I really appreciate former Secretary Donna Shalala, who happens to be the president of the University of Miami, for sponsoring this event. I thank Hank Klein, the chairman of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, as well for hosting this. And I thank my friend Chuck Cobb, who's the chairman of the Florida Free Trade Area of the Americas, Inc., which is a group of citizens concerned about free trade.;We meet at an historic time for this country's economy. Last week, we learned that September was America's 49th consecutive month of job creation—that's the longest uninterrupted period of job growth on record. And just yesterday, we learned that the American economy set new records for exports in a single month. More exports support better and high-paying jobs, and that's important for our citizens to understand. People who work for companies which export have a higher paying job than someone who doesn't. And so I believe strongly, to make sure that the historic records we've set in the last couple of days continue, that we've got to expand trade.;In Miami, you know what I'm talking about. You see, you see the value of trade every day. This city is known as the "Gateway to the Americas." Your openness to Latin America has helped make this city a vibrant center of culture and commerce and enterprise. People who know something about Miami understand the importance of trade to this city's future. Last year, $72 billion in trade passed through the Miami area, and nearly half of it went to our neighbors in the south. That trade helped the greater Miami economy grow at 6.7 percent in 2005, that's more than twice the national average. And the unemployment rate here has dropped to 4.1 percent, that is below the national average.;I think the case for trade is unmistakable in Miami, and we need to make that case all over the country. I've come to a place that has benefited from trade so others around the country can understand it can happen in their areas as well. Expanding trade and investment has been a commit-ment—longstanding commitment of the United States. I'm not the first President to ever stand up and say, we need to expand trade. As a matter of fact, Presidents from Eisenhower to Kennedy to Reagan and Clinton have worked to seize the opportunities of free and fair trade. Opening up foreign markets for America's goods and services has been a high priority of my administration. In January 2001, America had free trade agreements in force with just three countries. Now we have agreements in force with 14 countries, including 7 in Latin America.;Unfortunately, if we can just talk about trade around America, I don't know what it's like here in Miami, but when you're discussing trade around America, you hear troubling signs. There is a protectionist sentiment that are—is beginning to gain strength in America and in Congress. Recent trade agreements have passed by slim margins. Deals that were really good for the American economy barely passed the Congress. Advocates of economic isolationism in Congress have claimed the agreements I've just talked about would be "bad for American workers." One Congressman offered this prediction: If the agreements passed, "U.S. college grads will increasingly see a future in flipping hamburgers." That's the kind of rhetoric we're dealing with when it comes to whether or not this Nation ought to be confident and open up markets for goods and services around the world.;The results of the agreements are beginning to come in, and they're proving the critics wrong. In the 4 years since we implemented a free trade agreement with Chile, American exports to that country have more than doubled. In the 4 years since we implemented a free trade agreement with Singapore, American exports to that country have increased by about 50 percent. And in just 1 year since we began implementing a free trade agreement with Central America and the Dominican Republic, American exports to that region have grown by 13 percent.;And meanwhile, the U.S. economy has continued to grow and job expansion has been strong and hourly wages are on the rise and the job market for college graduates is bright. When trade expands, American workers gain because our workers are making products for people around the world who want to buy products that say "Made in the U.S.A.;Congress now has an opportunity to build on the success by passing new free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, and Panama. Today, all three of these countries enjoy duty-free access to U.S. markets for virtually all their products. They're shipping their goods our way, and most of those products enter America duty free. Yet when we ship our products their way, most of our products face significant tariffs. Our free trade agreements would knock down many of these barriers and level the playing field for our businesses and farmers and workers. Together, these agreements would expand access to 75 million new customers with a combined GDP of $245 billion. This May, my administration and Democratic leaders in Congress came together to forge a bipartisan consensus to consider these trade deals. And now it is the time to move forward with these progrowth, prodemocracy agreements.;And the stakes are high. As Congress debates, people across the hemisphere are watching to see if America will uphold its commitment to free and fair trade. In a recent letter to congressional Democrats, former Secretary Shalala—and I thank you for your leadership on this issue—and dozens of her Democratic colleagues wrote this: "Latin America is up for grabs. We fully recognize that asking the United States Congress to vote on these trade agreements is politically charged. Nonetheless, rejecting these agreements would set back regional U.S. interests for a generation. We must not walk away now.;Others who signed the letter include former Senators Bob Graham, Sam Nunn, and Bennett Johnston, as well as many others from the Clinton administration. Those who signed the letter are absolutely correct. Members of both parties in Congress should view these trade agreements for what they are, an historic opportunity to strengthen our economy at home and advance democracy and prosperity throughout our hemisphere. And Congress should approve these agreements soon, so that people across the Americas can see the benefits.;The first new Latin American trade agreement that my administration completed is with Peru. This agreement has great promise because Peru has one of the fastest growing economies in South America. Last year alone, Peru's economy expanded by 8 percent. And with greater prosperity in both our countries, trade between the United States and Peru has doubled over the past 3 years.;The free trade agreement with Peru would ignite even greater opportunities for both our nations. It would be especially beneficial to businesses and workers and farmers here at home. The free trade agreement would immediately eliminate most of Peru's industrial tariffs as well as many of the barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. It would also provide new market access and fair treatment to U.S. companies that provide services and invest in Peru. Here's what that would mean. If you're a Miami company exporting electronics to Peru, you would go from paying thousands of dollars in tariffs on the products you shipped to no tariff at all. In other words, your product would become more competitive. It would make it more likely you'd be able to sell into a new market. It would instantly make the products affordable. It would give our businessperson more money to invest here at home. The workers would be more likely able to keep their jobs.;A free trade agreement with Peru would strengthen our partnership with an important democracy in South America. Last year, Peru held two rounds of free and fair elections. And through their representatives, the Peruvian people have made it clear they want to increase their ties to the United States. The Peruvian Legislature passed the free trade agreement by an overwhelming margin. And now the United States Congress should show America's commitment in return by passing the Peru agreement quickly and with a strong bipartisan majority.;The second of the new Latin American trade agreements that my administration completed is with Colombia. Colombia is home to 44 million potential customers, more than the population of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and North Carolina put together. After years of hardship, Colombia's economy is strong and growing, with 6.8 percent expansion last year alone. Colombia is now our fifth largest trading partner in Latin America. And Colombia is the largest market for U.S. agricultural exports in South America.;The free trade agreement would open up Colombia's growing economy to our producers. It would immediately eliminate tariffs on more than 80 percent of American industrial and consumer goods exports. It would provide significant new duty-free access for American crops. The effects would be far-reaching. In Colombia, families would enjoy higher standards of living thanks to more affordable American products and more reliable access to our markets. Here at home, about 8,000 U.S. companies that export to Colombia would find new buyers for their goods and services. And for the first time in history, they would be able to compete in Colombia on a level playing field.;The strategic implications of this agreement are as important as the economic benefits. Colombia is one of America's strongest allies in the Western Hemisphere. It has been under assault by a formidable network of terrorists and drug traffickers, which has put its democracy at risk. In recent years, Colombia's democratically elected President has taken courageous steps to stop drug traffickers and rein in paramilitary groups and enforce the law.;The United States has supported President Uribe's efforts through an initiative called Plan Colombia, which was launched by President Bill Clinton and strongly supported by my administration. The results are striking. Since 2000, kidnapings and terrorist attacks and murders have all dropped substantially. Convictions have increased. Colombia has extradited hundreds of drug traffickers and terrorists to the United States. And the Colombian people are taking back their country from the narcoterrorists.;Some in Congress have expressed concern over violence in Colombia, particularly attacks on trade unionists. President Uribe takes these concerns seriously, and he has responded decisively. He's established an independent prosecutors unit to investigate and punish homicides against labor unionists. He's allowed the International Labor Organization to station a permanent representative in Bogota. He's worked to offer young Colombians better alternatives to a life of violence and drugs, including the new jobs and economic opportunities that would come from a trade agreement with the United States.;Colombia's record is not perfect, but the country is clearly headed in the right direction and is asking for our help. Both Houses of the Colombian Legislature have expressed overwhelming support for the trade agreement with the United States. And now they're waiting to see if we will uphold our end of the deal. If Congress were to reject this committed ally, we would damage America's credibility in the region and make other countries less willing to cooperate in the future. As Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada put it, "If the United States turns its back on its friends in Colombia, this will set back our cause far more than any Latin American dictator could hope to achieve." By its bold actions, Colombia has proved itself worthy of America's support, and I urge the United States Congress to pass this vital legislation as soon as possible.;The third of the new Latin American trade agreements that my administration completed is with Panama. Panama has the fastest growing economy in Central America, with a growth rate of more than 8 percent last year. Our nations have strong ties dating back to the construction of the Panama Canal. Trade has always been a key part of our relationship. Last year alone, our nations exchanged nearly $3 billion worth of goods.;The free trade agreement with Panama will build on this vibrant trade relationship. It will immediately eliminate tariffs on 88 percent of our industrial and consumer goods exports to Panama. It will open a new market for American farmers and ranchers, including fruit growers here in Florida. It will increase access to Panama's service sector, including its key financial services market. It will open opportunities for American businesses to participate in the Panama Canal expansion project. This is a good agreement, and we will continue to work closely with Congress and the Government of Panama to address the issues necessary to get it approved.;Collectively, these three trade agreements have the potential to boost our economy and strengthen our allies and spread prosperity throughout our region. We want people to be prosperous in our neighborhood. It's in the interests of the United States that prosperity spread throughout the—Latin America and South America. And yet many of our citizens feel uneasy about competition, and they worry that trade will cost jobs. You know, I understand why. I understand that if you're forced to change a job halfway through a career, it can be painful for your family. I know that. And that is why I'm a big believer in trade adjustment assistance that helps Americans make the transition from one job to the next.;In other words, I believe there is a role for the Federal Government, and that is, when a person loses a job because of trade, there's help for that person and family, help to get that person a new education— the community college system, for example, to be able to train that person for jobs which actually exist. Additional college enhances a worker's productivity. And when your productivity is enhanced, so your wages go up. And so rather than focus on— only on the risks or the negative, I think it's important for this country to focus on the much larger benefits of trade. We'll help those whose—lost a job because of trade. But it's important for our country to understand, trade yields prosperity, and prosperity means people will more likely be able to find work.;In the debate ahead, Members of Congress should keep in mind the American businesses and workers and farmers who will gain, who will benefit from a level playing field for their goods and services. They should keep in mind that American consumers will enjoy more choices and better prices that come with trade. They should keep in mind the millions in our hemisphere who will be lifted out of poverty. And above all, Members of Congress should have confidence in the ability of the United States to compete in the world. And they should show that confidence by approving these trade agreements with bipartisan votes.;In addition to these agreements, my administration will continue working to promote trade in other ways. At the national level, we will work closely with Congress to pass a landmark free trade agreement with South Korea. This agreement alone is projected to add more than $10 billion to our economy, and like our agreements in Latin America, it would strengthen our relationship with a democratic ally in a critical part of the world. At the regional level, we're seeking broad trade agreements in the Americas and Asia Pacific. And at the global level, we're pushing hard for a successful conclusion to the Doha round of trade talks, which has the potential to lower trade barriers across the world.;All of this will bring us closer to a world that lives in liberty, a world that grows in prosperity, a world that trades in freedom. In our hemisphere, that means an Americas where democratic nations work together to advance peace and justice and security, where the opportunity to succeed is as real in Lima as it is in Los Angeles, in Bogota as it is in Boston, where the opportunity for people to realize dreams is just as real in Panama City, Panama, as it is in Panama City, Florida. [ Laughter ];And the vision I have for our hemisphere includes a free and democratic Cuba. [ Applause ] Thank you. Sit down. Thank you.;Audience member. Viva Bush! [ Laughter ];The President. I'm not through yet. [ Laughter ];In Havana, the long rule of a cruel dictator is nearing an end. As Cuba enters a period of transition, nations throughout the hemisphere and the world must insist on free speech, free assembly, they must insist that the prisoners in Cuba be free, and ultimately, we must insist on free and competitive elections. [ Applause ] Sientese. [ Laughter ];I appreciate all you're doing to help make the vision of a free and prosperous Americas possible. That's why I've come to thank you. As business leaders who invest in new products and trade with your neighbors, you add to the vitality and dynamism of this region, and that helps our country. As scholars, people who study how to advance freedom and peace and prosperity, you've helped people understand the benefits of free trade, and I appreciate what you're doing.;I ask you to do one thing more, and that is to make sure your voices are heard to Members of the United States Congress. You don't need to worry about these three, don't waste your time. [ Laughter ] But there are people who need to hear from you. I would ask you to tell them that the free trade agreements with Peru, Colombia, and Panama are essential to our economy. I would ask you to remind them they are essential to our security, and I'd ask you to tell them that they're important for our moral interests.;Thank you for giving me a chance to come by. I appreciate you. Que Dios los bendiga.</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks With President Alan Garcia Perez of Peru on Signing the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act</td><td class="c6">December 14, 2007</td><td class="c7">President Bush. Thank you. Thank you. Please be seated. Good afternoon. Buenas tardes. President Garcia, thank you for being here.;Peru and the United States are strong partners, and today we're making that partnership even stronger. In a few moments, I'll have the honor of signing a bill that approves the vital free trade agreement between Peru and the United States. The bill will help increase opportunities for workers, ranchers, farmers, and businessmen in both our countries.;I want to thank the many Members of Congress, both in the House and the Senate, who came together to get this bill passed. I particularly want to thank the Members of Congress who are here today: the ranking member of the Ways and Means, Jim McCrery from Louisiana, Wally Herger from California, and Kevin Brady from the great State of Texas. [ Laughter ];I appreciate members of my Cabinet who have joined us today: the Secretary of State, Condi Rice, Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, Ambassador Sue Schwab, USTR, former Ambassador—I guess you still call him Ambassador, but he used to work for us—Rob Portman is here as well. [ Laughter ] And the reason the members of the Cabinet are here is because this administration is firmly committed to free and fair trade. We believe it's in the interest of the United States.;I want to thank John Walters as well, who is with us today. He's a member of the Cabinet, there he is. I want to thank Chuck Conner, Acting Secretary of the Agriculture, Steve Preston, U.S. Business Administration.;I welcome our Peruvian guests. I thank the Ambassadors from countries in our neighborhood, I'm glad you're here—Ambassadors from El Salvador, Honduras, Chile, Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Dominican Republic. I thank the Ambassadors and other representatives from countries who have pending free trade agreements before the United States Congress: the Ambassador from Colombia, Panama, and as well the Republic of Korea.;I thank those from the—who care about trade, who've joined us today. I appreciate your hard work on getting these agreements signed and ratified. And you know what I know: That when we extend trade, when we expand trade, America advances our deepest values as well as our economic interests. Opening markets has helped expand democracy. Openings markets helps expand and strengthen the rule of law. And opening markets helps lift millions out of poverty.;Open markets contribute to America's prosperity. Exports now account for a larger percentage of our GDP than at any other time in our history, which means that trade is a key driver for economic growth. Exports support higher paying jobs for our workers. This week, we learned that over the 12 months ending in October, U.S. exports increased by 13 percent.;The bill I signed today advances free and fair trade with one of the fastest growing economies in the Western Hemisphere. Last year, Peru's economy expanded by more than 7 1/2 percent, and I congratulate the President—wish he'd lend us a couple of percent. [ Laughter ] It's impossible to do. But trade will help growth. It will help the U.S. grow, and it will help Peru grow. Over the past 3 years, trade between our two nations has more than doubled to nearly $9 billion. With this free trade agreement, we will expand our trade even more and create new opportunities for citizens in both countries.;The agreement creates new opportunities here in the United States. Once implemented, it will immediately eliminate duties on about 80 percent of U.S. consumer and industrial goods sold in Peru. It will eliminate all remaining duties within 10 years. Once implemented, the agreement will also immediately eliminate the duties on more than two-thirds of U.S. agricultural exports to Peru and eliminate most of the remaining duties over the following 5 to 15 years.;This agreement will also create new opportunities for the people of Peru. This is good for the people of Peru. After all, the agreement locks in access for Peruvian businesses, small-business owners, and agricultural folks to the largest market in the world. With more U.S. products available in their country, Peruvians will benefit from more choices and more lower prices—or better prices. The more a consumer has to choose from, the better off that consumer will be. Opening up markets to U.S. goods and services will help the Peruvian consumer by removing barriers to U.S. services and investment.;The agreement will help create a secure, predictable legal framework that will help attract U.S. investors. The Peruvian people understand that expanding trade with the United States will improve their lives, that's what they understand. And so their representatives in the legislature approved this agreement by an overwhelming margin. And by his presence today, President Garcia is showing our common commitment to a hemisphere that grows in liberty and opportunity for all.;I want to thank the Congress for passing this bill. They passed it with broad, bipartisan support. Earlier this year, my administration and Congress came together on a bipartisan approach to free trade agreements. Under this approach, we included enforceable labor and environmental provisions in our pending free trade agreements. This is the approach we applied to our agreement with Peru, and this agreement shows the American people that Congress and the administration can work together— and are working together—in following a bipartisan way forward on trade.;I urge Members of Congress to continue on this path as they consider agreements with two other important partners in the region, Colombia and Panama. Across our hemisphere, people are watching what the Congress will do. They're watching to see what this Congress will do when it comes to how we treat our friends. They're watching carefully the actions of the Congress in regards to the free trade agreements with Colombia and Panama. The champions of false populism will use any failure to approve these trade agreements as evidence that America will never treat other democracies in the region as full partners.;Those who espouse the language of false populism will use failure of these trade agreements as a way of showing America doesn't—isn't committed to our friends in the hemisphere. It is vital that Congress send a strong message that the United States of America is committed to advancing freedom and prosperity in our neighborhood and approve these agreements with strong, bipartisan majorities.;Congress also needs to move forward with a bill to implement a free trade agreement with one of our most important partners in the Far East, South Korea. This agreement will create jobs and opportunity on both sides of the Pacific. It will strengthen a democratic ally. I urge Congress to act quickly and send this good bill to my desk.;As we work with Congress to approve trade legislation, we're also working to break down barriers to trade and investment at the global level. The best way to do so is through the Doha round of trade talks. A successful Doha round would open up markets for America's goods and crops and services. Doha also represents an historic opportunity to help lift millions of people out of poverty and despair. It's in our national interest to do so. It's in our moral interest to do so. My administration will continue to work to bring the Doha round of trade negotiations to a successful conclusion.;By advancing free and fair trade, we strengthen ties with our friends, we help democracies build a better life for their citizens, and we show that so long as the rules are fair, American workers can compete with anyone, anytime, anywhere.;Mr. President, I welcome you here to this important gathering. I ask you to give some words to the people of your country and our country. And after you finish speaking, it will be my honor to sign the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act.;Welcome, Mr. President.;President Garcia. Thank you. It's a great day for Peru, for the friendship between Peru and the United States. It's a great day for democracy and social justice and freedom. On the contrary, it's a bad day for the authoritarianism and those who— against the democracy and free trade.;Your Excellency and dear friends, now that the implementation bill for the trade promotion agreement between the U.S. and Peru has been signed, I would like to thank the American people and the U.S. Congress. And especially, I wish to express my sincere recognition to Your Excellency, the great supporter of the treaty and a true— a real, true ally and friend of the Peruvian people.;Today, the challenges to our societies are the consolidation of freedom, democracy, social justice, and peace, as well as the promotion of scientific and cultural development. The information and communication revolution allows countries to reach these goals and strengthen the links between our peoples by tearing down boulders and consolidating the foundations of human culture based in tolerance and respect to each other. Free trade agreements and world fora are important tools for these endeavors. More investment and more trade, as well as social policies, will contribute to eradicate poverty, protect the environment, and reduce and control migrations throughout the world.;Your Excellency, this is a crucial opportunity to consolidate hemispheric relations. The ties between the U.S. and Latin America has been blocked by misunderstandings, but they are also full of great prospects for reaching democracy and consensus.;Franklin Delano Roosevelt Good Neighbor Policy and John F. Kennedy Alliance for Progress come to my mind in this moment. Those initiatives were designed to contribute to a firm relationship between our peoples based on justice and development. Unfortunately, those were lost opportunities.;Today, I think, begins a new era. The free trade area of the Americas and the free trade agreements in the hemisphere open a third opportunity we must not squander. The treaty with Peru has been studied and discussed at length. First with your administration, then it has been enhanced in the dialog with the U.S. Congress, which lead to an extension for the environment and on labor chapters, which will favor the poor, the population in the Andes, and their small enterprises.;Other Latin America countries should also benefit from the great American market and the investment opportunities. In that regard, Colombia is a country with great challenges ahead. The hurdles that are claimed to delay the agreement with Colombia will be swiftly solved if the treaty is approved, creating more jobs and investment and development. I take upon myself the Latin American responsibility to request Your Excellency and the U.S. Congress to pass this agreement as soon as possible.;This treaty will contribute to our fight against narcotraffic and global terrorism. This would be critical to reaffirm democracy, freedom, investment, and prosperity for the Colombian people that I love very much. The same could be said about Panama.;Let me finish, Your Excellency, reaffirming that we both are committed to peace and against nuclear proliferation that may threaten the future of our children. We both fight for freedom and democracy.;Your Excellency, you should be sure, as well as the Members of the Congress and the American people, that in Peru this treaty would not exclude the poorest of the Peruvian workers. On the contrary, using the words of the great Abraham Lincoln, it will be a free trade agreement of the people, by the people, and for the people.;Thank you very much.;[ At this point, President Bush signed the bill. ];President Bush. Thank you all for coming.</td></tr>

Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the "1988 Act") (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States International Trade Commission (the "Commission") to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection. In 2006, the Commission recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to section 1205 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the "Convention"). In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, I modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) to conform the HTS to the Convention.;2. The Commission has recommended further modifications to the HTS pursuant to sections 1205(a) and (d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(a) and (d)) to alleviate unnecessary administrative burdens, and to ensure that the prior modifications proclaimed in Proclamation 8097 maintain substantial rate neutrality.;3. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.;4. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement with respect to the United States, and Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement with respect to the United States. In Presidential Proclamation 8097, I proclaimed modifications to the HTS that I determined were necessary or appropriate to continue to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamations 7746 and 7747.;5. In Presidential Proclamation 8214 of December 27, 2007, I further modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamations 7746 and 7747. Technical rectifications to the HTS are required to provide the intended tariff treatment.;6. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Congress approved the CAFTA-DR in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act") (19 U.S.C. 4011).;7. Sections 321-328 of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4081-4088) authorize the President to take certain actions in response to a request by an interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.

Bush: Proclamation 8236 - Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2008</td><td class="c6">April 10, 2008</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;On Pan American Day and during Pan American Week, we underscore the importance of a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous Western Hemisphere where our common values continue to strengthen friendships, advance freedom, and encourage fair trade.;The love of liberty is deeply rooted in our hemisphere. In the earliest days of our Republic, the people of the United States inspired patriots throughout the Americas to take their own stand for independence. Today, the decent and honorable people of both American continents are united in the desire for freedom and democracy. The United States stands with those who respect human rights and those who seek to bring change and hope to their countries. We look forward to the day when all of the Americas are wholly free and democratic.;My Administration remains committed to helping our friends as they advance the cause of justice and economic opportunity throughout the Western Hemisphere. Through Millennium Challenge Compacts, we support development in countries that govern justly, invest in their people, and promote economic freedom. In addition, the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, signed in 2005, has opened markets and created opportunities for American businesses, strengthened economic ties with our neighbors to the south, and brought hope to people so that they can better care for themselves and for their families. In December of 2007, I signed the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act to bring economic gains for both of our countries, empower workers, and foster accountability and the rule of law. We seek to build on these successes by working with the Congress to approve the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement and the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement. These and other free trade agreements enhance prosperity in the United States and signal our firm support for those who share our values of freedom and democracy.;As we recognize Pan American Day and Pan American Week, we will continue to work together to advance our common interests and build a future in which opportunity reaches into every community.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2008, as Pan American Day and April 13 through April 19, 2008, as Pan American Week. I urge the Governors of the 50 States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-second.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Proclamation 8272 - To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences, Take Certain Actions Under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and for Other Purposes</td><td class="c6">June 30, 2008</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;1. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)), beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to eligible articles.;2. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may designate articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP.;3. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed an amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).;4. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)), the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.;5. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(5)), any waiver granted under section 503(d) shall remain in effect until the President determines that such waiver is no longer warranted due to changed;6. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP if the President determines that such country has become a "high income" country as defined by the official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which such determination is made.;7. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2007 certain beneficiary developing countries have exported certain eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations, and I therefore terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.;8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.;9. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the advice of the United States International Trade Commission on whether any industries in the United States are likely to be adversely affected by such waivers, and I have determined, based on that advice and on the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), and after giving great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries.;10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(5) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that certain previously granted waivers of the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act are no longer warranted due to changed circumstances.;11. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Trinidad and Tobago has become a "high income" country, and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2010.;12. Section 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(1)) authorizes the President to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP. In Proclamation 7912 of June 29, 2005, I designated Serbia and Montenegro as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. On June 3, 2006, upon Montenegro's declaration of independence from Serbia and Montenegro, the country separated into two independent republics: the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro. Pursuant to section 502 of the 1974 Act, and taking into account the factors set forth in section 502(c) of that Act, I have determined that, in light of the separation of Serbia and Montenegro into two countries, the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro should each be designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.;13. Section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106-200, 114 Stat. 254) (AGOA), authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country if the President determines that the country meets the eligibility requirements set forth in section 104 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3703) and the eligibility criteria set forth in section 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462).;14. Section 104 of the AGOA authorizes the President to designate a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA as an eligible sub-Saharan African country if the President determines that the country meets certain eligibility requirements.;15. Section 112(c) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)), as added by section 6002(a) of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (division D of title VI of Public Law 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922), provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported from lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.;16. Pursuant to section 104 of the AGOA and section 506A(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the Union of the Comoros (Comoros) meets the eligibility requirements set forth or referenced therein, and I have decided to designate Comoros as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.;17. I have further determined that Comoros satisfies the criterion for treatment as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under section 112(c)(5)(D)(i) of the AGOA.;18. On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Congress approved the Agreement in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act") (19 U.S.C. 4011).;19. Pursuant to section 403(a) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(a)), the President is to report biennially to the Congress on the matters described in that section and, as the President deems appropriate, in section 403(b)(2) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(b)(2)).;20. Pursuant to section 403(a)(4) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(a)(4)), the President is to establish a mechanism to solicit public comments on the matters described in section 403(a)(3)(D) of the CAFTA-DR Act (19 U.S.C. 4111(a)(3)(D)).;21. In Presidential Proclamation 8213 of December 20, 2007, I modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) pursuant to section 1634 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280, 120 Stat. 780) to carry out the understandings described in that section. Technical rectifications to the HTS are required to provide the intended tariff treatment.;22. In Presidential Proclamation 8240 of April 17, 2008, pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I modified the HTS to withdraw duty-free treatment for certain articles from Jamaica. A technical rectification to the HTS is required to provide the intended tariff treatment.;23. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, section 104 of the AGOA, section 301 of title 3, United States Code (3 U.S.C. 301), and section 403 of the CAFTA-DR Act, do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) to the HTS is modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.;(2) In order to provide that one or more countries should not be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section B of Annex I to this proclamation.;(3) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for such HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section C of Annex I to this proclamation.;(4) The competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex II to this proclamation.;(5) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act shall apply to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries set forth in Annex III to this proclamation.;(6) The waivers of the application of section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act to the articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex IV to this proclamation are revoked.;(7) The designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2010.;(8) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting "Trinidad and Tobago" from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2010.;(9) The Republic of Serbia is designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.;(10) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 4(a) is modified by deleting "Serbia and Montenegro" and adding in alphabetical order "Serbia" to the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the thirtieth day after the date of this proclamation.;(11) The Republic of Montenegro is designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.;(12) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 4(a) is modified by adding in alphabetical order "Montenegro" to the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the thirtieth day after the date of this proclamation.;(13) Comoros is designated as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of the AGOA.;(14) In order to reflect this designation in the HTS, general note 16(a) to the HTS is modified by inserting in alphabetical sequence in the list of beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries "Union of the Comoros" effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after July 1, 2008.;(15) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, Comoros is a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African

Bush: Remarks on Voluntarism</td><td class="c6">September 8, 2008</td><td class="c7">Thank you all. Please be seated. Welcome to the south ground of the White House. It is a joy to be here with members of the armies of compassion. I'm really glad you're here. I appreciate your inspiration to our fellow citizens. I believe you are a constant reminder of the true source of our Nation's strength, which is the good hearts and souls of the American people.;We have seen the good hearts of our people over the last week as caring volunteers have helped their fellow citizens through Hurricane Gustav and Tropical Storm Hanna. The Red Cross, which provides a vital role in helping the relief efforts and recovery efforts, has been spending millions of dollars to provide shelter and food for the evacuees and to help with the clean-up efforts. Yet, charitable contributions have not kept pace with their expenses, and I hope our fellow citizens will support the Red Cross, particularly as Hurricanes Ike and other storms develop over the gulf coast. You can help by going to the Red Cross's web site, redcross.org, and make a vital contribution to help our fellow citizens.;I appreciate the fact that those here represent the hundreds of thousands of our citizens who answered the call to love a neighbor like we'd like to be loved ourselves. I appreciate the fact that you and others lift up souls, one person at a time. You strengthen the foundation of our democracy, which is the engagement of our people. I want to thank you for what you do. God bless you and welcome.;I thank Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, Department of the Interior, and Patricia, who have joined us. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez, Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters, Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy--welcome Madame Congresswoman--thanks for coming. I appreciate Stephen Goldsmith, the Chairman of the Corporation for National and Community Service, Jack Hawkins, Director of Volunteers for Prosperity, Ron Tschetter, who is the Director of the Peace Corps--[applause]--I knew that was coming--[laughter]--Jean Case, the Chairman of the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation, and members of that council.;I appreciate my buddy Michael W. Smith, who is going to play a couple of songs for us here, and his wife, Debbie. I want to thank student and school administrators and board members from the LEAGUE that are here today. These are students from schools all across the country. We are glad you are here.;With us is the 2007 Spirit of Hope Award recipient. This is the military's way of honoring people who have given back to their communities. Giovanni Balingit--Giovanni, welcome, thank you, sir, congratulations to you. I want to thank all those who are here in the United States military. Thank you for wearing the uniform of the United States.;And most of all, thanks for coming. I really appreciate your taking time out to come by and let me say hello to you.;In my first Inaugural Address, I challenged all Americans to be citizens--not spectators--responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.;Eight months later, Americans were tested by the worst attack on our Nation. In the midst of chaos and sorrow, Americans responded with the--with characteristic courage and grace. It was a remarkable moment in our country. It really was, when you think about it. Rescue workers wrote their Social Security numbers on their arms and then rushed into buildings. Citizens became members of ambulance teams. And people from all across the country poured into New York City to help.;The terrorists who attacked our country on September the 11th didn't understand our country at all. Evil may crush concrete and twisted steel, but it can never break the spirit of the American people.;In the weeks and months after the attacks, inspiring acts continued to unfold all across the country. I'm sure you heard the stories, just like I did. Men and women of our Armed Forces accepted dangerous new duties, and a lot of folks stepped forward to volunteer to protect our fellow citizens. But the desire to serve reached far beyond the military. Millions of Americans were--really wanted to help our country recover.;And so, to tap into that spirit, I called on every American to spend at least 4,000 hours--or 2 years in the course of a lifetime--to serve our Nation through acts of compassion. Some said that's acting--asking a lot for the country, and they were right--and they were right. Two years during a lifetime is a lot to give. But the truth of the matter is, citizens who do give realize that they become enriched just like those folks that they're helping.;To empower Americans looking to help, we launched what's called the USA Freedom Corps. The goal of the USA Freedom Corps was to connect Americans with opportunities to serve our country, to foster a culture of citizenship and responsibility and service. Over the last 6 years, the USA Freedom Corps has met these goals.;One way we helped was to launch a web site called volunteer.gov, which is the largest clearinghouse of volunteer opportunities in America. In other words, we used high-tech innovations to be able to channel people's desire to serve in a constructive way.;And so, the Government--this Government web site directs people to private charities or local churches or Habitat for Humanity drives or Meals on Wheels--just opportunities to serve their neighbor. We can't put love in somebody's heart, but we certainly can help somebody channel their love. And that was the purpose of the web site.;And you can search by hometown. They tell me that if you get on Crawford, Texas, you'll find that the local Humane Society leaks--seeks volunteer pet groomers, which makes Barney really nervous. [Laughter];This is just one of 4 million volunteer opportunities on the USA Freedom Corps web site. Isn't that interesting? There are 4 million opportunities for somebody who wants to serve to say, "Here's how I can help." And so, I urge our fellow citizens to go to the web site and find out if there's not something that'll interest you, something that'll give you a chance to serve something greater than yourself.;The USA Freedom Corps fosters a culture of service by encouraging the private sector to step forward. We've got what we call the Pro Bono Challenge, which is--encourages corporate professionals to donate their services to charities and nonprofits. That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it, to encourage corporate America to not only serve their shareholders, but serve the communities in which they exist.;One really interesting, innovative idea came out of IBM this year. IBM employees will donate millions of hours of service to charities in the U.S., as well as technology projects in developing nations. They tell me that this work would cost $250 million if IBM's devoted employees were charging and not providing for free. I want to thank the CEO of IBM, Sam Palmisano, who is with us today. Sam, thank you very much for coming. And I encourage corporate America to figure out ways that they can serve to make America a better place.;Another key component of USA Freedom Corps is our effort to keep track of Americans' service to others. I mean, it's one thing to talk about it, it's another thing to measure, to kind of see how we're doing. In 2002, this administration became the first to conduct a regular survey of volunteerism through the U.S. Census Bureau. Because we've brought--begun to measure, we know that nearly 61 million Americans now give their time to help their neighbors. Isn't that interesting? Sixty-one million of our fellow citizens volunteer.;We've also launched new national programs and enhanced others to help our citizens answer the call to service. For example, we helped Americans answer the call by creating the Citizen Corps. [Applause] Sounds like quite a few members have shown up. [Laughter] And we are glad you're here.;For those of you who don't know what the Citizen Corps is, it's a way for people to volunteer to help respond to disasters. This was set up right after September the 11th. Americans have formed community emergency response teams--[applause]--there you go--fire corps, medical reserve corps, neighborhood watch groups. Today, there are nearly 1 million Citizen Corps volunteers nationwide.;And one of those volunteers is County Judge Ed Emmett from Harris County, Texas. So, let me tell you about what the Citizen Corps of Harris County did. So, Katrina hits, there's about 200,000 gulf coast residents headed into the Houston area. The Citizen Corps showed up. Volunteers came to process evacuees, to help treat the ill and injured, and to help settle storm victims in permanent housing.;Here's what Ed said--I've known him for a long time, by the way--the Judge said: "That's just what members of the Citizen Corps do, they take care of their neighbors." And Judge, I want to thank you, and all of the members of the Citizen Corps nationwide for taking care of your neighbors.;We've helped Americans answer the call by creating a program called Volunteers for Prosperity. This initiative matched skilled American professionals with service opportunities, a lot of them in the developing world. This year, we mobilized more than 43,000 doctors, teachers, engineers, and other skilled volunteers. That's a pretty good start for an important program, it seems like to me. These men and women save babies from malaria on the continent of Africa. They bring modern information technology to Afghanistan. They live out one of America's strongest beliefs, that to whom much is given, much is required.;One of those people who is a member of this important team is Zach Harvey. He serves on the prosthetics staff at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. When he isn't--[applause]--let me finish with old Zach yet. [Laughter] When he isn't busy helping our wounded warriors, he's putting his skills to use in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic as a Volunteer for Prosperity. He works with pediatric cancer patients who've had a limb amputated as part of their treatment. He and his team of volunteers fit the children with new limbs, and they pass on their skills to other caregivers.;He says the only payment he receives is the pride that comes with children's--seeing children walk again. And Zach, we are proud to have you here, and thank you for your service. Zach doesn't want anybody to look at him--[laughter]--but you can't help it when you're that kind of kind man. Appreciate it.;By the way, both the Citizen Corps and Volunteers for Prosperity have been very effective programs. And I really believe Congress needs to make these good programs permanent.;We've also helped answer the call to service by strengthening AmeriCorps. This is a program that matches dedicated volunteers with hundreds of private charitable institutions. AmeriCorps members sign up for 1-year commitments with the idea of strengthening their communities by teaching adults how to read or improving health care or helping the homeless put a roof over their heads. This is a good program that was started by my predecessor, President Clinton.;After 9/11, we tried to make this program more effective, in other words, to help the dollars allocated go further. Today, more than 74,000 people serve their fellow citizens through AmeriCorps. I have met AmeriCorps volunteers all over our country, and they're very inspiring Americans.;One such volunteer was--is Emily Greene. After college, she enlisted in the program to serve with the Schools of Hope Literacy Project in Madison, Wisconsin. Through the Schools of Hope, Emily has recruited hundreds of volunteers to teach children how to read. What kind of--what a wonderful gift. When somebody says, "How can I help serve America?," how about teaching a child to read as a lasting contribution to the future of our country.;Madison's public elementary schools are improving, the achievement gap is narrowing. And Emily, it must make you feel great to leave a lasting contribution. And we are glad you're here on behalf of AmeriCorps. Thanks for coming.;We've also helped others serve by expanding the Peace Corps. [Applause] So, see, you don't know what I know: That every time I go to an embassy overseas and I mention anything about the Peace Corps, and there happens to be a Peace Corps contingent--they give that same kind of yell. [Laughter] Peace Corps volunteers are incredibly motivated people, and it's a fabulous program.;The number of Peace Corps volunteers has increased. We've reopened 13--reopened programs in 13 countries. This is a vital program. There are about 8,000 Peace Corps members. They are fighting AIDS in Africa, training poor workers to start their own businesses in Latin America, they're teaching English to children in Asia. What they're doing is they're showing the rest of the world the compassionate heart of the American citizens. I mean, we are a compassionate nation, and the Peace Corps does a fabulous job of advancing that compassion.;Praya Baruch is with us today. After college, Praya spent 2 years in Ghana working with people who are HIV-positive, training religious leaders to provide community-based care, and educating young people about HIV preparation. She is now on the staff of the Peace Corps. She represents the 8,000 people who are on the frontlines of helping people deal with some of the more--most difficult problems in the world. Praya, we are honored you're here, and I want to thank the Peace Corps.;There are other ways to help Americans answer the call to service. We have got what we call the Faith-Based and Community Initiative through which we've empowered Americans to volunteer through their churches and congregations.;You know, I believe that if a program is successful, government ought to support it. And I believe if it takes faith to help some--solve some of the most intractable problems, government ought not to fear the influence of faith in our society, we ought to welcome the influence of faith in our society.;Laura--who is not here, but sends her best wishes--has rallied thousands of volunteers to help at-risk children through Helping America's Youth Initiative. We've encouraged volunteerism by holding up examples of our volunteers. You know, to date, 1.1 million Americans have received the President's Volunteer Service Award. That may not seem like a big deal to some people, but when you get one and you show it to people you're working with, they say, "How do I get one of those?" [Laughter] "What do I need to do?" Well, what you need to do is serve your community by volunteering and help make somebody's life better.;Volunteerism is strong in the country. But the truth of the matter is, the farther we've gotten away from 9/11, that memory has begun to fade. And some are saying, "Well, maybe I don't need to volunteer now. Maybe the crisis has passed." The aftermath of 9/11 isn't nearly as intense as it was. And my call to people is, there's always a need. You should be volunteering not because of 9/11, but you should be volunteering because our country needs you on a regular basis.;We can use your help. There are citizens who say, "I need love." Government can pass law, but it cannot put love into somebody's heart. Oftentimes that helps when somebody puts their arm around you and say, "How can I help you, brother or sister? What can I do to make your life better?;And so, today I call upon our fellow citizens to devote 4,000 hours over your lifetime in service to your country. You'll become a better person for it, and our society will be more healthy as a result of it. You know, there's an old adage that says, you can bring hope to the lives of others, but the life you enrich the most will probably be your own.;I've witnessed the amazing phenomena of volunteerism throughout my travels in this country. At nearly every stop, I make it a point to meet a local volunteer selected by the USA Freedom Corps at the steps of Air Force One. After they get over the initial shock of seeing me come off the plane--[laughter]--I love to ask them what they're doing, what are you doing to make your community a better place?;One such volunteer is a young woman I met in Pittsburgh named Kristen Holloway. She started a program called Operation Troop Appreciation. It started off as kind of a small program, just an idea, a desire to make a statement. Her group collects everything from DVDs and phone calls--cards to musical instruments and sports gear. So far, they have sent care packages to more than 40,000 men and women serving in the frontlines in this war against the extremists. In every package--[applause].;Kristen, we're glad you're here. Thank you for--by the way, you're representing a lot of people here in this audience and around the country who have had--I have had the honor of meeting as volunteers at the foot of Air Force One.;I want to thank you all for showing up when I show up. Generally, the weather is nice, sometimes it's not so nice. But nevertheless, you're there with your smiling face, and you inspire me. You really do lift up my spirits, to meet people who are so dedicated that they are willing to take time out of their lives to help somebody in need. And I hope by getting you on the front page of your newspapers, that you inspire others to show up and serve America by volunteering.;But I want to tell you what the--what a soldier wrote to Kristen's group. A soldier wrote back after getting one of the packages and said, "My heart soars with pride to represent a country filled with such wonderful people as you." That was the thank you note that Kristen's group got.;Well, my heart soars with pride as well to be in the presence of those who are lifting up souls and helping mend hearts. I want to thank you for what you're doing. I am incredibly optimistic about the future of our country. And the reason I am is because I've seen firsthand the love and the compassion and the decency of our fellow citizens.;May God bless you. May God bless the armies of compassion.;And now please welcome my buddy Michael W. Smith.</td></tr>

Bush: Memorandum on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2009</td><td class="c6">September 15, 2008</td><td class="c7">Presidential Determination No. 2008-28;Memorandum for the Secretary of State;Subject: Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2009;Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries: Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela.;A country's presence on the Majors List is not necessarily an adverse reflection of its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B). I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions and continued support for bilateral programs in Bolivia are vital to the national interests of the United States.;Under the leadership of President Karzai, the Government of Afghanistan has made some progress in combating narcotics. However, drug trafficking remains a serious threat to the future of Afghanistan, contributing to widespread public corruption, damaging legitimate economic growth, and fueling violence and insurgency.;A successful counternarcotics strategy in Afghanistan hinges on maintaining security, building public capacity, attaining local support, and actively pursuing our joint counternarcotics strategy.;Poppy cultivation continues to be marked by the divide between the increasingly poppy-free northern provinces and the insurgency-dominated regions in the south. Through political will, and by using a mixture of incentives and disincentives, governors in key northern provinces like Badakshan and Nangarhar have significantly reduced poppy cultivation.;Inspired by the Nangarhar model, the newly appointed governor of the southern province of Helmand has taken bold steps to implement the first truly serious counternarcotics campaign in the province. It is clear that progress in Helmand Province will not come easily. Drug control efforts in this area of pronounced poppy cultivation are thwarted by heavily entrenched Taliban centers of power. In 2007 Helmand Province cultivated more than half of Afghanistan's illegal poppy crop.;Difficult security conditions greatly impede counternarcotics operations, particularly in the south and southwest provinces, areas in which the insurgency and organized crime groups predominate and where over 85 percent of Afghan poppy is cultivated.;Drug-related corruption in Afghanistan--one of the most intransigent problems in the country--must be confronted, particularly at provincial and district government levels. Corruption and illegal drugs in Afghanistan threaten to undermine all aspects of the country's efforts to build a sustainable economic infrastructure and functioning democracy.;The United States enjoys close cooperation with Canada across a broad range of law enforcement issues. Both of our nations face a serious challenge from the 2-way flow of drugs across our long border. While Canada is primarily a drug consuming country, it is also a significant producer of highly potent marijuana and has become the primary source country for MDMA (ecstasy) available in the United States. Additionally, Canada serves as a transit or diversion point for precursor chemicals and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals used to produce illicit synthetic drugs, most notably MDMA. While methamphetamine use has decreased in the United States, due in large part to past efforts to reduce precursor chemical diversion by Canadian authorities, production of finished methamphetamine is increasing in Canada and could lead to greater supplies in the United States. Canada is pursuing a new National Anti-Drug Strategy that focuses on proven approaches to reduce drug use and deter drug trafficking. The United States and Canada continue to work productively in joint law enforcement operations that disrupt drug and currency smuggling operations along the border.;The growing expansion of drug trafficking in Central America poses serious challenges to the region's limited capability to combat both the narcotics trade and organized crime. We are particularly concerned about the increasing presence of drug trafficking organizations in Central America that are fleeing more robust counternarcotics regimes elsewhere, especially in Mexico and Colombia. Often unimpeded, traffickers use long Central American coastlines for illegal maritime drug shipments. Even though there have been noteworthy seizures, a high proportion of drugs transiting Central America are not detected or seized.;The March 2008 gun battle between drug organizations in Guatemala demonstrates that criminal organizations such as the Sinaloa cartel are trying to reinforce their trafficking strongholds in Central America. In 2008, Guatemala passed new anti-organized crime and extradition laws. While such actions are encouraging, Guatemala must work aggressively to implement these measures, just as neighboring countries must redouble their practical efforts to implement adopted reforms aimed at thwarting criminal activity.;The United States is encouraged by the commitment of the Regional Integration System to a regional response, such as sharing counternarcotics intelligence. Support for cohesive regional institution-building and practical law enforcement enhancements in Central America are critical components to a successful regional counternarcotics strategy. We look forward to working with Guatemala and other Central American nations to support counternarcotics programs and the rule of law under the new Merida Initiative.;The Government of Ecuador is committed to protecting its borders and territory against drug trafficking and other transnational crimes. The increased presence of Ecuadorian security forces in its counternarcotics efforts provided a more effective deterrent to drug production and trafficking. The identification of new trafficking trends and increased staffing and inspection at all air, land, and sea ports are also helping to hinder drug trafficking. With a system for tracking vessels already in place, Ecuador is expanding this capability and more effectively utilizing it as a tool for working with partner nations. The country's ability to identify the nationality of ships is of special concern as considerable cocaine destined for the United States has been detected on Ecuadorian-flagged vessels.;The countries of West Africa have emerged as key transit hubs for Andean cocaine trafficked through Venezuela and Brazil and destined for European markets. This trafficking is undermining many of the already fragile institutions of countries in the region. Narcotics traffickers have focused their illegal activities in Guinea-Bissau, but have recently extended their operations south to Guinea. The presence of Latin American drug traffickers and the large quantities of cocaine trafficked openly suggest that drug criminals may exercise the prerogatives of sovereign nation-states in these two countries. West Africa has long been a hub for illicit criminal networks. West African states lack resources to sufficiently counter efforts by drug trafficking organizations whose activity threatens the stability of these countries and the well-being of their people.;International donors and organizations are working to assist governments in their counternarcotic efforts. We support these efforts to preserve and protect stability and positive growth in this region.;Nigeria, a major transit country for illicit drugs destined for the United States, continues to make some progress on counternarcotics and has cooperated effectively with the United States on drug-related money laundering cases. Since it began operations in 2005, the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit has investigated numerous suspicious transaction reports that have resulted in high-profile convictions recorded by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). However, recent developments in Nigeria raise questions about whether the EFCC will remain an effective anticorruption agency. The United States Government has had extradition requests pending in Nigeria for years and is concerned that Nigeria's extradition practices and procedures remain obstacles to the effectiveness of this essential counternarcotics law enforcement tool. We are encouraged that Nigeria's use of U.S.-donated body scanners at its four major international airports has resulted in the arrest of numerous drug traffickers. Moreover, we fully support the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency's recent cooperation in regional search and seizure operations.;The Government of India maintains a strong track record of regulating, monitoring, and curbing its licit opium production and distribution process. India has introduced robust, high-tech methods to control cultivation by licensed opium farmers. In this sense, India must continue to refine its control measures to guard against the continuing problem of diversion of licit opium crops, grown for the production of pharmaceutical products, to illegal markets. The United States continues to be concerned about illicit opium poppy production in certain areas of the country, such as West Bengal and the state of Uttaranchal along the India-China Border, previously thought to be free of such cultivation. Nevertheless, during the past year the country has destroyed substantial areas of illicit poppy cultivation. The Indian Government must also continue to investigate cases of large, illicit poppy production and accordingly bring perpetrators to trial. The United States, along with other foreign governments and international organizations, has a good working relationship with India to interdict the flow of narcotics being smuggled across India's borders.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;George W.

Bush: Remarks to Leaders of the Western Hemisphere in New York City</td><td class="c6">September 24, 2008</td><td class="c7">Listen, thank you all very much for being here. I'm joined by leaders throughout our hemisphere to discuss trade and prosperity. I know they're going to want to hear about the rescue plan that we have submitted to the Congress. They can see our legislative process is full of give-and-take, that there's ample debate. But I am confident that when it's all said and done, there will be a robust plan, and there needs to be.;Each of the 11 countries here has a free trade agreement with the United States or one pending before Congress. Free and fair trade is in our mutual interests.;What's interesting about free and fair trade amongst the nations is that the people benefit. For example, the Central American- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement is in its early stages, but trade between participating countries with the United States is up 23 percent. That translates to jobs and prosperity. In the 5 years since the free trade agreement between the United States and Chile took effect, trade between our two nations has increased by more than 180 percent. And that's positive. In other words, these agreements are mutually beneficial. And most importantly, they help small-business owners and workers and farmers and ranchers.;In the nearly 15 years since NAFTA entered into force, trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico has increased by a combined total of more than 200 percent.;Today our countries are launching the Pathways to Prosperity in the Americas Initiative to continue this progress. This initiative will provide a forum where leaders can work to ensure that the benefits of trade are broadly shared. It will deepen the connections among regional markets. It will expand our cooperation on development issues. This is a very promising initiative, and I expect positive results when our representatives meet on these issues later this year.;It's important for the American people to understand that exports benefit workers. Half of our growth last year was the result of trade. And therefore, it's in our interest to continue to open up markets, particularly in our own neighborhood. There are three free trade agreements pending in the Congress today: South Korea, Panama, and Colombia. Obviously, two of those are with nations in our own hemisphere. The Colombia free trade agreement will be good for Colombia, it will be good for America. The President and I have worked diligently to make sure this is a fair agreement, and Congress needs to pass it.;The Panamanian agreement--it's good for Panama, it's good for America. And Congress ought to pass that agreement too. It's important that these agreements be passed as soon as possible.;I want to thank the leaders for joining us. I'm looking forward to our discussion. I appreciate your hard work in working to make sure your people and your countries have great opportunities. One such opportunity is access to jobs provided by markets.;Thank you for your vision, and thank you for your leadership. Thank you.</td></tr>

Section 213A(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703a(b)) (the "CBERA"), as amended by section 15402(a)(2) of the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (part 1 of subtitle D of title XV of Public Law 110-246, 122 Stat. 2289) (the "HOPE II Act"), provides that preferential tariff treatment may be provided for certain apparel and other articles originating in Haiti that are imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic into the customs territory of the United States.;2. Pursuant to section 213A(f)(3) of CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703a(f)(3)), as redesignated by section 15403(2) of the HOPE II Act (122 Stat. 2302), apparel and other articles described in section 213A(b) of CBERA that are shipped from the Dominican Republic to the United States directly or through the territory of an intermediate country shall not qualify for the preferential tariff treatment provided for under section 213A(b) until the President certifies to the Congress that Haiti and the Dominican Republic have developed procedures to prevent unlawful transshipment of the articles and the use of counterfeit documents related to the importation of the articles into the United States.;3. I have determined, and hereby certify, that Haiti and the Dominican Republic have developed the procedures described in section 213A(f)(3) of CBERA.;4. Section 15406 of the HOPE II Act (122 Stat. 2308) authorizes the President to exercise the authority provided under section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483) (the "1974 Act"), to proclaim such modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) as may be necessary to carry out the HOPE II Act.;5. I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to perform the following functions: the functions set forth in section 213A(d)(4) of CBERA, as amended (122 Stat. 2307, 19 U.S.C. 2703a(d)(4)), the reporting function set forth in section 213A(e)(1)(B)(ii) of CBERA, as amended (122 Stat. 2302, 19 U.S.C. 2703a(e)(1)(B)(ii)), the consultation function set forth in section 213A(e)(1)(C)(i) of CBERA, as amended (122 Stat. 2302-3, 19 U.S.C. 2703a(e)(1)(C)(i)), and the functions set forth in section 213A(e)(5) of CBERA, as amended (122 Stat. 2307, 19 U.S.C. 2703a(e)(5)).;6.

A technical rectification to the HTS is required to provide the intended tariff treatment.;8.

Madam President, I could not think of anybody better to give me dancing lessons than you. [Laughter] We love you. I love your spirit, I love your leadership, I love the example you set for leaders all across the globe. And it's an honor to be here with you.;And it's an honor to be here with you all. I welcome you to the White House Summit on International Development. It's a summit to herald the outstanding work being done to lift up souls in need. I appreciate the fact that folks in this room represent thousands that are replacing disease with health, dependency with self-reliance, and despair with hope.;The people gathered here come from different countries--I see we represent different professions--but we're united by our commitment to charting a new era in development. Today I'm going to talk with you about this new philosophy, about the way it's transforming countries and saving lives, and about why it's essential to continue in the years ahead.;Before I do so, I want to recognize not only the President, but her son, Robert. I suspect your mother tells you what to do like my mother tells me what to do. [Laughter] As a matter of fact, your mother tells me what to do. [Laughter] Welcome.;Congressman Donald Payne, we're sure proud you're here, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for coming. Much of the success of the programs we've implemented are due to, one, the generosity of the American people, but also the fine group of people that are implementers: Henrietta Fore, the Administrator of USAID, Rob Mosbacher, president and CEO of OPIC, Ambassador John Danilovich, Millennium Challenge Corporation CEO, Ambassador Mark Dybul, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, U.S. Malaria Coordinator. Thank you all for being leaders.;The second choice to introduce me was Bob Geldof, musician. Of course, he'd have got up and said, "I saw him try to sing while in Africa." [Laughter] I've come to really appreciate Bob Geldof. He is a genuine person who has used his fame to help others in need, and it is a--it's been a joy to work with you. And you know, you and I might look differently, but I think we share the same compassion and the same hopes. And thank you for joining us today.;I want to thank the panelists who have participated in this conference. I do want to welcome members of the diplomatic corps, thank you all for coming by today.;You know, we meet today in the middle of a serious global financial crisis. Over the past few weeks, we have seen how the world's economies are more interconnected than ever before. The crisis is having a major impact on working people all over the world, including many in developing nations.;During times of economic crisis, some may be tempted to turn inward, focusing on our problems here at home, while ignoring our interests around the world. This would be a serious mistake. America is committed--and America must stay committed--to international development for reasons that remain true regardless of the ebb and flow of the markets. We believe that development is in America's security interests. We face an enemy that can't stand freedom. And the only way they can recruit to their hateful ideology is by exploiting despair, and the best way to respond is to spread hope.;We believe that we ought to remain committed to development because it's in our long-term economic interests. When America helps developing nations rise out of poverty, we create new markets for our goods and services, and better jobs for American workers. And we're committed to development because it's in our moral interests. I strongly believe in the timeless truth, to whom much is given, much is required. We are a blessed nation, and I believe we have a duty to help those less fortunate around the world. We believe that power to save lives comes with the obligation to use it. And I believe our Nation is better when we help people fight hunger and disease and illiteracy.;For all of these reasons, this administration has made international development one of our biggest priorities. As the President mentioned, we've worked with partner nations--as well as the World Bank, and the IMF, and the African Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank--to relieve tens of billions of dollars in debt from some of the world's poorest nations. By relieving crushing debt burdens, it gives people hope. We've also worked with wealthier nations to provide aid in the form of grants instead of loans. For the past 8 years, the United States has provided more foreign assistance than at any time in the past half century.;We're using this aid to foster sustainable economic growth and promote good governance and advance a model of true partnership that gives poor nations a real stake in their own development. We're encouraging volunteer organizations, local charities, and the faith community to take on an even greater role, because we strongly believe that they offer compassion that no government can offer. Most of all, we're insisting on accountability in return for our assistance, so we can ensure that our generosity leads to measurable results. You know, for too long, foreign aid was designed to make us feel good. Now, we're ensuring that our resources do good.;This new approach to development is embodied by a revolutionary initiative called the Millennium Challenge Account. See, this program says that the United States will help, but we expect countries that we help to fight corruption and to govern justly. There's nothing more pitiful than to have people's hopes robbed by corrupt government officials. We say to those we want to help, support open markets to trade and investment, and above all, invest in your people's health and education. You see, by tying our aid to these policies, we are encouraging developing nations to make tough economic and political and social reforms. We encourage leaders to respect their citizens, uphold human dignity, and work to earn the trust of their people. This approach is based on a clear conviction: People in the developing world have the capacity to improve their own lives, and they will rise to meet high standards.;I refuse to accept the development model that says, oh, these people are doomed forever, let's just throw money at the problem. We believe that if you set high standards, good people will rise to meet those standards, regardless of where they live in the world. So the Millennium Challenge Account is a robust program that has invested $6.7 billion in 35 countries around the world. From Albania to Moldova to Indonesia to Mongolia to Paraguay to Peru, these partnerships are helping developing nations take charge of their future, and more importantly, unleash the talents of their people.;For example, this February, President Kikwete of Tanzania and I signed a 5-year, nearly $700 million compact to improve the country's transportation, energy, and water supply. It's pretty basic needs, isn't it?--transportation, energy, and water supply. The partnership will build roads that connect rural Tanzanians to markets and schools and health clinics. It's hard to have a modern society if you can't get your product from rural to urban centers in your country. It's hard to get doctors to help people in the rural part of the country if you don't have roads to connect health care clinics to those in need. It's going to extend electricity to homes and businesses in some of the most remote areas of the country. It will increase access to clean drinking water, which will help reduce preventable diseases, especially in young children. Through these projects, the Millennium Challenge compact is helping Tanzania build a foundation for success in the 21st century, showing the promise of a new era in development.;In the new era of development, America and our partners are helping to meet basic human needs like food and clean water. There's nothing more basic than food and clean water. Since 2002, the United States has provided more than $16 billion in food assistance, helping to ensure that tens of millions of people around the world do not go hungry. In response to the current global food crisis, we've committed $5.5 billion to address global hunger over the next 2 years. And that's important. These are stopgap measures. The American people care when they hear people are going hungry around the world. And I want to thank the American people for their generosity.;But as we work to resolve the crisis in the long run, we have got to find better solutions for global hunger in the long term. In the short run, we're helping, in the long term, we're developing a strategy and working with partners to help them grow their own food. There's no other way to put it. The best long-term policy for the United States is to help nations develop their own agricultural industry, so we don't have to deal with global food crisis year in and year out.;And so we supply poor and rural farmers with fertilizer and water-management systems. We distribute better seeds that will boost yields and invest in research that will make crops like rice and wheat more resistant to drought and pests. You know, one of the really important challenges that this administration has taken on, and future administrations must take on, is to say to other markets around the world, it is okay to import markets to crops grown with biotechnology. A lot of countries are resistant upon introducing these new technologically advanced crops, because they fear they're not going to be able to sell their crops elsewhere. And yet these crops will help people realize a vibrant agricultural industry.;I believe that as the United States moves forward, we ought to purchase up to a quarter of our food from local farmers. In other words, of all the food aid we get we ought to take a quarter of that, Donald, and purchase the food directly from local farmers. If it's in our interest to help build a local agricultural industry, then instead of just giving food, we ought to purchase food from the farmers themselves, to help build a vibrant agricultural sector in parts of the world where food is desperately needed. I support the World Bank's strategy to increase investment in agriculture.;What I'm telling you is there's a better way than just a kind of patchwork approach. It's an approach that basically says we can use our technological advancement and our expertise to help build vibrant agricultural industries in nations where there ought to be crops today.;The United States works with partner nations to deal with the lack of clean water. Last year, we dedicated nearly a billion dollars to improve sanitation and water supplies in developing nations. We're also wise enough to enlist the private sector to help as well.;I want to share with you an interesting program--for two reasons, one, it's interesting, and two, my wife thought of it--[laughter]--or has actually been involved with it, she didn't think of it. But she thought of it for this speech. She has been involved with a public-private partnership called the PlayPumps Alliance. It brings together international foundations and corporations and the U.S. Government. Now, catch this: PlayPumps are children's merry-go-rounds attached to a water pump and a storage tank. When the wheel turns, clean drinking water is produced. And as my good wife says, "PlayPumps are fueled by a limitless energy source--[laughter]--children at play.;The United States is working with our partners to install 4,000 pumps in schools and communities across sub-Sahara Africa, which will provide clean drinking water to as many as 10 million people. It's not that hard to help people get clean drinking water. It takes focus, imagination, and effort. And I call upon all nations around the world to join us.;In the new era of development, America and our partners recognize that education is the gateway to prosperity and essential to any society's long-term success. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? If people are educated, they can read the instructions on a medicine bottle. They can keep receipts for a small business. They can learn about the rights and privileges they have under their country's constitutions. Yet too many people can't read. America and our partners are determined to extend the promise of good education to more people in the developing world.;In the Middle East, USAID has partnered with local officials to start kindergartens in Jordan, taught hundreds of thousands of children about information technology in Morocco, built 70 schools for girls in Egypt.;Through our Africa Education Initiative, as the President mentioned, the United States has trained more than 700,000 teachers. I think you said a million teachers? Yes, I'll go for a million then. [Laughter] Somewhere between 700 and a million. [Laughter] Distributed more than 10 million textbooks--somewhere between 10 million and 15 million--and provided hundreds of thousands of scholarships to help girls go to school.;Last year, I announced a new initiative that will devote $425 million to improve education in Ethiopia and Ghana and Honduras and Liberia and Mali and Yemen. Why? Why do we do that? Because the truth of the matter is, we want children to fulfill their God-given potential, that's why we do that. And so we're helping to train the doctors and the lawyers and the engineers and entrepreneurs and the women presidents who will be vital to the future of the developing world.;In the new era of development, America and our partners are helping to lift the burden of deadly disease. In Africa, the treatable and preventable disease of malaria kills one child every 30 seconds. So in 2005, I launched a 5-year, $1.2 billion initiative that cut the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations by half.;Through the initiative, we joined with African governments--notice, "we joined with African governments"--to design malaria control strategies that will work with their nations. We expect results for the money we spend. And yet we're confident when we work with governments that they can develop the strategy necessary to achieve the objectives. And so we supply the money, and our partner nations work to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets, conduct indoor spraying campaigns, and provide cutting-edge drugs.;The interesting thing about this initiative is, it's easy to measure whether or not we're being successful. In the new development agenda, results matter a lot. And therefore, when the United States works with countries, we expect there to be a well-defined strategy and the ability to measure whether or not our money is working. I don't think that's too much to ask, nor do the people who are trying to help think that's too much to ask.;So far, our efforts have reached 25 million people. In places like Zambia and Ethiopia and Rwanda and Zanzibar, the numbers of people sick or dying from malaria have dropped dramatically. We have not only made progress around the edges, we've made dramatic progress in saving lives. I find that the work to defeat malaria is exciting work, and it is inspiring work. And frankly, it's not all that hard to design a strategy to get bed nets to people. And I want to thank my fellow citizens for caring deeply about this initiative. And I want to thank our partners for working hard to make sure that a mom won't have to worry about her child dying because of a mosquito bite.;The President talked about our fight against HIV/AIDS. And it's a noble battle, and it's a necessary battle. In 2003, as she had mentioned, we launched PEPFAR. The program is the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history. Ambassador Dybul and I believe that the program is effective because it is defined by a few key principles. You know, if you're going to have a new era of development, it's important to have clear definitions. It's one thing just to throw money at the problem, it's another thing to insist upon strategies that actually work. So the emergency plan demands specific measurable targets for progress. His job is to not only put the implementers in place and to find those souls who are on the frontlines of saving lives and empower them, his job is to report back to the President and say, "Here is the progress we're making, Mr. President." That way it gives me a chance to say, "Well, if you're not making enough progress, Mark, do something differently, please.;It employs a prevention strategy that works: ABC, which means "Abstinence, Be faithful, and use Condoms." This isn't guesswork, this is a program that is working. It puts local partners in the lead, because they know the needs of their people best. It enlists new partners from the international community, the private sector, and the faith community.;I can't tell you how many people that I've met in the United States who say, "I'm part of PEPFAR because my church has adopted the program." You know, there's nothing better than having people who hear the universal call to love a brother like you'd like to be loved yourselves on the frontline of helping to save lives.;And the United States Government is smart enough to enlist the compassion and love and hard work of people in the faith community in the United States to help our brothers and sisters in need. So far, the results are striking. When we launched the initiative in 2003, only 50,000 people in sub-Sahara Africa were receiving antiretroviral treatment.;Today, we support treatment for nearly 1.7 million people in the region, and tens of thousands of more around the world, from Asia to the Caribbean to Eastern Europe. PEPFAR has supported care for nearly 7 million people, including millions of orphans and vulnerable children. PEPFAR has allowed nearly 200,000 children in Africa to be born HIV-free. PEPFAR is working. And I want to thank the United States Congress for coming together to reauthorize and dramatically expand this program.;I'm sure that many of you had the same experiences that Laura and I have had in meeting people whose lives have been touched by the initiatives we're talking about today. I'll never forget meeting Harriet Namutebi. She is--we met her in Africa on our trip 5 years ago. She lost her brother, her husband, and one of her children to AIDS. She was diagnosed, she locked herself in her room, she refused to eat, and she wanted to die.;But at a clinic supported by PEPFAR, Harriet was given a new lease on life. Counselors at the clinic showed Harriet how to live positively with HIV. A loving soul took this person who was in despair and said, "Here's a chance for you.;Thanks to the antiretroviral treatments Harriet received, she is now in good health. She cares for four children. She is an enthusiastic member of the clinic's drama group, which educates others about HIV. She is living proof of what people in Africa call the Lazarus effect: Communities once given up for dead are now being brought back to life. And it is a joy to be a part of PEPFAR.;In the new era of development, we are working with partners to unleash the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known, and that is free trade. For developing nations, the value of trade is nearly 40 times the value of foreign aid. Let me repeat that: For developing nations, the value of trade is 40 times the value of foreign aid. Isn't that an interesting statistic? What should that tell you? It says, if you're interested in helping the developing world, promote trade. That's what it ought to tell you.;According to the World Bank, the complete elimination of barriers to trading goods would boost annual income in developing countries by more than $140 billion. I think that would go a long way, don't you, Madam President?;You know, trade opens growth, ignites growth, but it also produces other benefits. It helps increase transparency, it helps increase the rule of law. During my administration, we have worked hard to reduce barriers to trade and investment. When I took office, we had free trade agreements in effect with three nations. Today, we have them with 14 nations, most of them are developing countries. We've also--[applause].;My predecessor, President Clinton, did a smart thing with the African Growth and Opportunity Act. My administration had the honor of extending that act. In 2005, I worked with Congress to pass a free trade agreement with the Dominican Republic and nations in Central America, it's called CAFTA. And although it's still in its early stages, trade between participating countries with the U.S. is up 30 percent since its enactment. Do you know what that means? That means more jobs for workers in those countries. It means more food for families. It means more investment that developing countries need to grow and prosper. That's what that means.;Trade is essential to prosperity in both good economic times and bad. During periods of crisis, like the one we're in now, protectionism may seem like the best way to safeguard wealth. But when major economies try to wall themselves off, they deny themselves the growth that comes from exports and deepen poverty by depriving poor nations of vital markets for their goods. You see, in the midst of this crisis, I believe the world ought to send a clear signal that we remain committed to open markets by reducing barriers to trade across the globe. The recent impasse in the Doha round of trade talks is disappointing, but that doesn't have to be the final world--word. And so before I leave office, I'm going to press hard to make sure we have a successful Doha round.;In this new era of development, countries that make the courageous choice to embrace democracy must realize the economic benefits that go with it. When young democracies do not deliver improvements in their people's daily lives, the people start to lose faith in free societies. That's a fact.;For example, let's talk about our own neighborhood. I believe it's in our interest that we have a good, sound neighborhood. It's in our interest our neighborhood prosper and get along. And we've seen hopeful advances for democracy and free enterprise in North and South America. There's no doubt about it, there's been some amazing advances. Yet there's also voices that challenge free markets and democratic values--quite loud voices. Some of them have gained a following, because amid the progress in our hemisphere, we also see terrible want. What the campesinos and trabajadores want is--what they don't need is false populism, what they do need is social justice. And the development aid of the United States has been focused on providing social justice in our neighborhood.;True social justice requires creating new opportunities for prosperity and upward mobility. So working in partnership with Latin American nations, we've helped more than 400,000 poor and disadvantaged children learn to read. We've increased economic opportunity by relieving debt and opening trade, as I mentioned. We've delivered aid that empowers the poor and the marginalized. Since I took office, with support from the Congress, the United States has provided nearly $15 billion to the region with a special focus on helping the poor.;True social justice requires government institutions that are fair and effective and free from corruption. You can't have social justice if your government is stealing from you. Since 2001, the United States has doubled our worldwide commitment to programs that foster democracy and good government, including programs in Latin America. We've entered into the Millennium Challenge Account agreements with six nations in Latin America and the Caribbean, and a number of other countries are pursuing compacts.;We've worked with countries like El Salvador to train law enforcement officers who can combat criminal gangs. Mexico--we're partnering with the Government to stop smugglers who traffic in everything from guns to human beings. Colombia--we've worked closely with President Uribe to defeat the cocaine cartels and narcoterrorists. By the way, it is no coincidence last year that Colombia's economy saw its largest growth in nearly three decades, because that country has got a strong leader willing to take on the FARC.;True social justice requires compassion. And some of the greatest work of compassion in Latin America is being done by the United States military. I don't know if you ever heard of the Navy hospital ship called the Comfort, but it sailed to 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean last year. Doctors treated tens of thousands of poor patients and conducted more than 26,000 surgeries. Dentists and hygienists filled cavities and cared for infections and treated young children. These men and women are showing that the nations of Latin America have a strong partner in the United States of America. They're a part of our efforts to show that the institutions of freedom and capitalism and democracy are not threats to be feared, but the surest path to social justice there is.;From fostering good governance and reform to alleviating hunger and disease to advancing education, prosperity, and justice, our new approach to development has shown inspiring signs of success. Yet this success can be reversed, and the cost of abandoning our commitments would be far higher than the cost of fulfilling them. So I urge both parties in Congress to ensure that our development efforts remain an enduring priority of the United States.;I call on other members of the G-8 and the United Nations, as well as our fellow contributors to the Global Fund, to follow through on their pledges. Corporations and foundations have shared their resources and expertise with the developing world, and I urge them to continue their generosity. Faith-based groups have done amazing work to heal the sick and lift up the suffering, and I urge them to carry on their missions of mercy.;It's amazing what individual Americans have done to help with our--the new era of development. I got a Christmas gift from one of my little nephews, which was mosquito nets. Thousands of individuals and schoolchildren in--all across the country are donating $10 to buy a mosquito net to help save a life. There are people who are raising money for HIV/AIDS initiative. There are people who are going on a service mission with their house of worship. These folks are making a huge contribution, and I urge them to continue their good work.;History shows what happens when America combines our great compassion with our steadfast determination. We are a compassionate people, and we are a determined people. During a recent visit, a good friend of mine shared his vivid childhood memories of the Marshall plan. We were sitting--standing on the South Lawn. He said he'll never forget the kindness America showed his nation in a time of need, and now that man is the Prime Minister of Italy. And last week, Silvio Berlusconi expressed his enduring loyalty and gratitude to the people of the United States.;It's not hard to imagine what fruits our compassion will yield 60 years from today. We can see it in the faces of Afghan girls going to school for the first time. We can see them in the proud eyes of Latin American workers providing for themselves and for their families. We see them in the joy of new African mothers whose babies are protected from malaria and HIV. We see them in the outpouring of thanks throughout the developing world. I'm just so sorry that not every American could have been with Laura and me and see what we saw in our trip to Africa last year. Schoolchildren sang songs about America's generosity. One shop-owner, I think who was in Liberia, Madam President, painted his stall in our Nation's colors. Tens of thousands of people lined the roadsides during our visit, cheering and waving American flags in gratitude to the American people.;I'm honored to be the President of such a nation filled with people of such generosity and goodness. I'm proud to join with all of you in ushering in a new era of development. This is an historic commitment that we all can be proud of, one that will secure a bright future for our partners in the developing world, one that will make America a better place. God bless you.</td></tr>

Bush: Proclamation 8323 - To Provide for Duty-Free Treatment Under the Earned Import Allowance Program, and for Other Purposes</td><td class="c6">November 25, 2008</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;1. Section 404 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act"), as added by section 2 of Public Law 110-436, 122 Stat. 4976, provides for preferential tariff treatment of eligible apparel articles wholly assembled in an eligible country and imported directly from an eligible country, if such articles are accompanied by an earned import allowance certificate issued under a program established by the Secretary of Commerce.;2. Section 404(e)(1) of the CAFTA-DR Act, as amended, provides that the program providing this preferential treatment shall be in effect for the 10-year period beginning on the date on which the President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees that sections A, B, C, and D of the Annex to Presidential Proclamation 8213 of December 20, 2007, have taken effect.;3. On August 7, 2008, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) published a notice in the Federal Register (73 FR 46057) announcing that August 15, 2008, would be the effective date for sections A, B, C, and D of the Annex to Presidential Proclamation 8213.;4. I have determined, and hereby certify, that the provisions of Proclamation 8213 referenced in section 404(e)(1) of the CAFTA-DR Act, as amended, have taken effect.;5. Section 6002 of the Africa Investment Incentive Act of 2006 (division D, title VI of Public Law 109-432) (the "2006 Act") amended section 112(c) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)) to modify the preferential tariff treatment accorded to designated lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries.;6. Pursuant to section 6002 of the 2006 Act, in Proclamation 8114 of March 19, 2007, I proclaimed modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to provide the tariff treatment authorized by the 2006 Act. The HTS provisions proclaimed in Proclamation 8114 were modified by Proclamation 8157 of June 28, 2007, and Proclamation 8240 of April 17, 2008, to provide the tariff treatment authorized by the 2006 Act.;7. Section 3 of Public Law 110-436 amends section 112(c) of the AGOA to modify the tariff treatment applicable to lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, and to provide that Mauritius is to be treated as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of the AGOA.;8. Accordingly, in order to reflect the amendments to section 112(c) of the AGOA, I have determined that it is appropriate to modify the HTS to reflect the tariff treatment provided to lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries and to provide that Mauritius is to be treated as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country for purposes of the AGOA.;9. Section 203(e)(1)(A)(i) of the Andean Trade Preference Act, as amended (ATPA) (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)(A)(i)), authorizes the President to withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary country for purposes of the ATPA if, after such designation, the President determines that as a result of changed circumstances such country should be barred from designation as a beneficiary country.;10. Section 3103 of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (Title XXXI of the Trade Act of 2002, Public Law 107-210) (ATPDEA) amended section 203(e)(1) of the ATPA (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)) by adding a new subparagraph (B)(i) authorizing the President to withdraw or suspend the designation of any country as a beneficiary country for purposes of the ATPDEA if, after such designation, the President determines that, as a result of changed circumstances, the performance of such country is not satisfactory under the eligibility criteria set forth in section 204(b)(6)(B) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(6)(B)).;11. Section 203(e)(2)(A) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(2)(A)) requires the President to publish notice of the action he proposes to take at least 30 days before taking action under section 203(e)(1) (19 U.S.C. 3202(e)(1)).;12. On October 1, 2008, the USTR, at my direction, published a notice in the Federal Register (73 FR 57158) announcing that I proposed to suspend the designation of Bolivia as a beneficiary country for purposes of the ATPA and the ATPDEA based on Bolivia's failure to satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in section 203(d)(11) and section 204(b)(6)(B)(v) of the ATPA, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3202(d)(11), 3203(b)(6)(B)(v)).;13. I have determined that Bolivia no longer satisfies the eligibility criterion in section 203(d)(11) of the ATPA, as amended. Therefore, pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(A)(i) of the ATPA, I have determined that, as a result of this changed circumstance, Bolivia's designation as an ATPA beneficiary country should be suspended.;14. I have determined that Bolivia is no longer performing satisfactorily under the eligibility criterion in section 204(b)(6)(B)(v) of the ATPA, as amended. Therefore, pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B)(i) of the ATPA, I have determined that, as a result of this changed circumstance, Bolivia's designation as an ATPDEA beneficiary country should be suspended.;15. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182) (the "NAFTA Implementation Act"), incorporated in the HTS the tariff modifications and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.;16. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA country and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA. Section 202(q) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332(q)) authorizes the President to proclaim, as a part of the HTS, the rules of origin set out in the NAFTA, and to proclaim modifications to such previously proclaimed rules of origin, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 103(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3313(a)).;17. The United States and Canada have agreed to modify certain NAFTA rules of origin and to apply the modified rules to their bilateral trade. It is therefore necessary to modify the NAFTA rules of origin set out in Proclamation 6641.;18. Section 1230 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-432) temporarily modified the rate of duty on triphenyl phosphine. Modifications to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment.;19. Presidential Proclamation 7011 of June 30, 1997, implemented the World Trade Organization Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products for the United States. Annex 1 to that proclamation failed to include certain products. Technical corrections and conforming changes to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment for those products.;20. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483) (the "1974 Act"), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 404 of the CAFTA-DR Act, as amended, section 104 of the AGOA, section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act, section 203 of the ATPA, as amended, section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide the tariff treatment for eligible articles provided for in section 404 of the CAFTA-DR Act, as added by Public Law 110-436, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex A to this proclamation.;(2) In order to reflect changes to the tariff treatment for certain apparel products under the AGOA, U.S. note 5 to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 of the HTS, subheadings 9819.15.10 through 9819.15.42, inclusive, and the superior text thereto are deleted from the HTS, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after October 31, 2008.;(3) For purposes of section 112(c) of the AGOA, as amended, Mauritius is included as a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after October 31, 2008.;(4) The designation of Bolivia as a beneficiary country for purposes of the ATPA and ATPDEA is suspended effective on December 15, 2008. Accordingly, effective on that date, general note 11(a) to the HTS is modified by deleting "Bolivia" from the list of ATPA beneficiary countries. Further, general note 11(d) to the HTS is modified by deleting "Bolivia" from the list of ATPDEA beneficiary countries. In addition, U.S. note 1 to subchapter XXII of chapter 98 of the HTS is modified by removing "Bolivia" from the list of ATPDEA beneficiary countries.;(5) In order to modify the rules of origin under the NAFTA, general note 12 to the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex B to this proclamation.;(6) (a) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex A to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date set forth in Annex A.;(b) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex B to this proclamation shall enter into effect on the date that the USTR announces in a notice published in the Federal Register that Canada has completed its applicable domestic procedures to give effect to corresponding modifications to be applied to goods of the United States and shall be effective with respect to goods of Canada entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date indicated in the notice.;(7) In order to provide the intended tariff treatment to triphenyl phosphine and to correct the error identified in paragraph 19, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex C to this proclamation.;(8) The modifications to the HTS made in Annex C to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date set out in that Annex.;(9) The USTR shall notify the Congress of this proclamation and my certification as provided in section 404(e) of the CAFTA-DR Act, as amended.;(10) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.;GEORGE W.

On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the "Agreement countries"). The Agreement was approved by the Congress in section 101(a) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "Act") (19 U.S.C. 4011).;2. The Parties to the Agreement entered into an amendment of the Agreement on July 27, August 6, and August 14, 2007 (the "Amendment"). The Amendment provides for temporary duty-free treatment for certain goods of Costa Rica. The terms of the Amendment with respect to Costa Rica are contained in letters of understanding described in section 1634(b)(2) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280, 120 Stat. 780).;3. Section 201(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(1)) authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Articles 3.3 and 3.27, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) and 3.27 of the Agreement.;4. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(2)), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country.;5. Consistent with section 201(a)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(3)), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country, subject to the exceptions set out in section 201(a)(3)(B) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(a)(3)(B)).;6. Consistent with section 213(b)(5)(D) of the CBERA (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)(5)(D)), as amended by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) (Public Law 106-200), each Agreement country is to be removed from the enumeration of designated CBTPA beneficiary countries on the date the Agreement enters into force with respect to that country.;7. Section 201(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4031(b)) authorizes the President, subject to the consultation and layover requirements of section 104(a) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 4014(a)), to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such modifications as the United States may agree to with an Agreement country regarding the staging of any duty treatment set forth in Annex 3.3 of the Agreement, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions provided for by the Agreement. The consultation and layover requirements of section 104(a) of the Act have been satisfied with respect to providing temporary duty free treatment for certain goods of Costa Rica as set forth in the Amendment.;8. Pursuant to section 201(b) of the Act, I have determined that the modifications herein proclaimed of duties on goods of Costa Rica are necessary or appropriate to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Costa Rica provided for by the Agreement.;9. In Proclamation 8095 of December 29, 2006, consistent with the authority set out in section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)), I modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to implement the multilateral agreement negotiated under the auspices of the World Trade Organization to eliminate tariffs on certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediates. I have determined that technical corrections to the pharmaceuticals annex to the HTS are necessary to ensure that certain products receive the intended duty treatment.;10. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 201 of the Act and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and the Act having taken effect pursuant to section 107, do proclaim that;(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded to Costa Rica under the Agreement, as amended, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods for the purposes of the Agreement, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain goods, to reflect the removal of Costa Rica from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, to reflect the removal of Costa Rica from the enumeration of designated beneficiary countries for purposes of the CBERA and the CBTPA, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annexes I and II of Publication 4038 of the United States International Trade Commission, entitled Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to Costa Rica (Publication 4038), which is incorporated by reference into this proclamation.;(2) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the intended duty treatment to certain pharmaceutical products and chemical intermediaries, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex III of Publication 4038.;(3) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in Annex I, II, or III of Publication 4038.;(4) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this proclamation, this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2009.;(5) Any provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.;GEORGE W.

Bush: Proclamation 8341 - To Implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement and For Other Purposes</td><td class="c6">January 16, 2009</td><td class="c7">By the President of the United States of America;A Proclamation;1. On April 12, 2006, the United States entered into the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (the "Agreement"), and on June 24 and June 25, 2007, the Parties to the Agreement signed a protocol amending the Agreement. Congress approved the Agreement as amended in section 101(a) of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the "Implementation Act") (Public Law 110-138, 121 Stat. 1455) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note).;2. Section 105(a) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to establish or designate within the Department of Commerce an office that shall be responsible for providing administrative assistance to panels established under chapter 21 of the Agreement.;3. Section 201 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuation of any duty, such continuation of duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply Articles 2.3, 2.5, 2.6, 3.3.13 and Annex 2.3 of the Agreement.;4. Section 201(d) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate quotas set forth in Appendix I to the Schedule of the United States to Annex 2.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United States.;5. Consistent with section 201(a)(2) of the Implementation Act, Peru is to be removed from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries eligible for the benefits of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on the date the Agreement enters into force. Further, consistent with section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that other technical and conforming changes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are necessary to reflect that Peru is no longer eligible to receive the benefits of the GSP.;6. Section 203 of the Implementation Act sets forth certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purpose of implementing preferential tariff treatment provided for under the Agreement. I have decided that it is necessary to include these rules of origin, together with particular rules applicable to certain other goods, in the HTS.;7. Section 203(o) of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru, to establish procedures governing the request for any such determination and ensuring appropriate public participation in any such determination, to add any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted or unrestricted quantity, to eliminate a restriction on the quantity of a fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the fabric, yarn, or fiber to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted quantity, and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.;8. Section 208 of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to take certain enforcement actions relating to trade with Peru in textile and apparel goods.;9. Subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act authorizes the President to take certain actions in response to a request by an interested party for relief from serious damage or actual threat thereof to a domestic industry producing certain textile or apparel articles.;10. Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, established the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (CITA), consisting of representatives of the Departments of State, the Treasury, Commerce, and Labor, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, with the representative of the Department of Commerce as Chairman, to supervise the implementation of textile trade agreements. Consistent with section 301 of title 3, United States Code, when carrying out functions vested in the President by statute and assigned by the President to CITA, the officials collectively exercising those functions are all to be officers required to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.;11. Presidential Proclamation 7971 of December 22, 2005, implemented the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (USMFTA). The proclamation implemented, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Morocco Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USMFTA Act") (Public Law 108-302, 118 Stat. 1103) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply certain provisions of the USMFTA, including Articles 2.5 and 2.6. The proclamation inadvertently omitted two modifications to the HTS necessary to carry out the provisions of Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USMFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment under Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USMFTA.;12. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA). The proclamation implemented, pursuant to section 201 of the United State-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USBFTA Act") (Public Law 109-169, 119 Stat. 3581), the staged reductions in rates of duty that I determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply certain provisions of the USBFTA, including Articles 2.5 and 2.6. The proclamation inadvertently omitted two modifications to the HTS necessary to carry out the provisions of Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USBFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment under Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USBFTA.;13. Presidential Proclamation 8331 of December 23, 2008, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) for trade with Costa Rica. The proclamation implemented, pursuant to section 201 of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act") (Public Law 109-53, 119 Stat. 467) (19 U.S.C. 4031), the duty treatment necessary to carry out or apply Articles 3.3 and 3.27, and Annexes 3.3 (including the schedule of United States duty reductions with respect to originating goods) and 3.27, of the CAFTA-DR. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide the intended duty treatment under the CAFTA-DR.;14. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended, authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of relevant provisions of that Act, or other Acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 604 of the 1974 Act, sections 105(a), 201, 203, 208, and subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act, and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and having made the determination under section 101(b) of the Implementation Act necessary for the exchange of notes, do hereby proclaim;(1) In order to provide generally for the preferential tariff treatment being accorded under the Agreement, to set forth rules for determining whether goods imported into the customs territory of the United States are eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement, to provide certain other treatment to originating goods of Peru for the purposes of the Agreement, to provide tariff-rate quotas with respect to certain originating goods of Peru, to reflect Peru's removal from the enumeration of designated beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP, and to make technical and conforming changes in the general notes to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I of Publication 4058 of the United States International Trade Commission, entitled, "Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement", which is incorporated by reference into this proclamation.;(2) In order to implement the initial stage of duty elimination provided for in the Agreement and to provide for future staged reductions in duties for originating goods of Peru for purposes of the Agreement, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex II of Publication 4058, effective on the dates specified in the relevant sections of such publication and on any subsequent dates set forth for such duty reductions in that publication.;(3) The amendments to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the relevant dates indicated in Annex II to Publication 4058.;(4) The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to exercise my authority under section 105(a) of the Implementation Act to establish or designate an office within the Department of Commerce to carry out the functions set forth in that section.;(5) The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is authorized to exercise my authority under section 201(d) of the Implementation Act to take such action as may be necessary in implementing the tariff-rate quotas set forth in Appendix I to the Schedule of the United States to Annex 2.3 of the Agreement to ensure that imports of agricultural goods do not disrupt the orderly marketing of commodities in the United States. This action is set forth in Annex I of Publication 4058.;(6) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 203(o) of the Implementation Act to determine that a fabric, yarn, or fiber is or is not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru, to establish procedures governing the request for any such determination and ensuring appropriate public participation in any such determination, to add any fabric, yarn, or fiber determined to be not available in commercial quantities in a timely manner in the United States and Peru to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted or unrestricted quantity, to eliminate a restriction on the quantity of a fabric, yarn, or fiber within 6 months after adding the fabric, yarn, or fiber to the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement in a restricted quantity, and to restrict the quantity of, or remove from the list in Annex 3-B of the Agreement, certain fabrics, yarns, or fibers.;(7) The CITA is authorized to exercise my authority under section 208 of the Implementation Act to exclude certain textile and apparel goods from the customs territory of the United States, to determine whether an enterprise's production of, and capability to produce, goods are consistent with statements by the enterprise, to find that an enterprise has knowingly or willfully engaged in circumvention, and to deny preferential tariff treatment to textile and apparel goods.;(8) The CITA is authorized to exercise the functions of the President under subtitle B of title III of the Implementation Act to review requests, and to determine whether to commence consideration of such requests, to cause to be published in the Federal Register a notice of commencement of consideration of a request and notice seeking public comment, to determine whether imports of a Peruvian textile or apparel article are causing serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive with, the imported article, and to provide relief from imports of an article that is the subject of such a determination.;(9) The CITA, after consultation with the Commissioner of Customs (the "Commissioner"), is authorized to consult with representatives of Peru for the purpose of identifying particular textile or apparel goods of Peru that are mutually agreed to be handloomed fabrics, handmade goods made of such handloomed fabrics, folklore goods, or handmade goods that substantially incorporate a historical or traditional regional design or motif, as provided in Article 3.3.12 of the Agreement. The Commissioner shall take actions as directed by the CITA to carry out any such determination.;(10) The USTR is authorized to fulfill my obligations under section 104 of the Implementation Act to obtain advice from the appropriate advisory committees and the United States International Trade Commission on the proposed implementation of an action by presidential proclamation, to submit a report on such proposed action to the appropriate congressional committees, and to consult with those congressional committees regarding the proposed action.;(11) The USTR is authorized to modify U.S. note 29 to subchapter XXII of chapter 98 of the HTS in a notice published in the Federal Register to reflect modifications pursuant to paragraph (6) of this proclamation by the CITA to the list of fabrics, yarns, or fibers in Annex 3-B of the Agreement.;(12) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the intended duty treatment under Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USMFTA, Articles 2.5 and 2.6 of the USBFTA, and the CAFTA-DR, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex III of Publication 4058.;(13) All provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third.;GEORGE W.

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Attached to this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions and continued support for bilateral programs in Bolivia are vital to the national interests of the United States.;Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest producer of opium poppy and a major source of heroin. The Government of Afghanistan, under the leadership of President Karzai and key governors in the provinces, has demonstrated its ongoing commitment to combating narcotics and has made notable improvements in this regard over the past year.;The connection between opium production, the resulting narcotics trade, corruption, and the insurgency continues to grow more evident in Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation remains largely confined to five contiguous provinces in the south where security problems greatly impede counternarcotics efforts, and nearly all significant poppy cultivation occurs in insecure areas with active insurgent elements. Counternarcotics efforts have shown greater impact where security exists, where public information messages can be conveyed, alternative development delivered, interdiction performed, and justice carried out. While the Government of Afghanistan made some progress during the past year, the country must dedicate far greater political will and programmatic effort to combat opium trafficking and production nationwide.;Pakistan is a major transit country for opiates and hashish for markets around the world, as well as for precursor chemicals moving into neighboring Afghanistan where they are used for processing heroin. Opium poppy cultivation in Pakistan is also a primary concern.;In 2008 and 2009, religious extremist groups controlled major portions of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where most of Pakistan's poppy is grown. These extremist groups also pushed into settled areas of the country's Northwest Frontier Province, such as the Peshawar Valley and the Swat Valley. The Government of Pakistan was compelled to divert manpower and equipment resources from poppy eradication efforts to contest these incursions.;The joint Narcotics Affairs Section and Pakistan's Narcotics Control Cell indicated that 1,909 hectares of poppy were cultivated in 2008 (approximately one percent of the cultivation in Afghanistan). This is down from the 2,315 hectares cultivated in 2007. In 2007, when the insurgent problem was not as widespread, 614 hectares were eradicated, bringing harvested poppy down to 1,701 hectares. During 2008, there were significant narcotics and precursor chemical seizures in Pakistan. United States counternarcotics and border security assistance programs continue to build the counternarcotics capacity of law enforcement agencies, especially in Baluchistan and along the Makran coast.;As Mexico and Colombia continue to apply pressure on drug traffickers, the countries of Central America are increasingly targeted for trafficking, which is creating serious challenges for the region. In 2008, approximately 42 percent of the cocaine destined for the United States transited Central America directly from South America. Often unimpeded due to the region's limited capabilities and resources, traffickers use land routes and Central America's coastal waters for illegal drug movements. The Merida Initiative, which provides Central American countries $165 million for FY 2008 and FY 2009, offers the opportunity to boost the capabilities of the region's rule of law institutions and promote greater regional law enforcement cooperation.;Within the Central America region, Guatemala has been listed as a major drug transit country since 1990. Guatemala continues to be challenged by increasing violence related to narcotics trafficking. Corruption and inadequate law enforcement efforts contributed to low interdiction levels during the past several years. The United States continues to support the Government of Guatemala to improve its counternarcotics efforts.;In Honduras, drug traffickers have capitalized on the country's lack of resources, corruption, and ungoverned spaces. Despite the current political instability, Honduran security forces have been conducting counternarcotic operations and have already seized more illegal drugs than in all of 2008. Honduras has also agreed to a bilateral integrated strategy with the United States to strengthen the operational counternarcotics capabilities of its security and law enforcement forces.;Panama is a major drug transit country that seized 51 metric tons of cocaine in 2008 while working in partnership with the United States. El Salvador is not a primary transit country, but in 2008 the Salvadoran government seized 1.4 metric tons of cocaine, 300 kilograms of marijuana, and nine kilograms of heroin. El Salvador may see an increase in drug activity corresponding with rising drug trafficking levels in the eastern Pacific. The United States is increasingly concerned with the large amount of drugs trafficked through Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Interdiction efforts in these two countries in 2008 resulted in the seizure of 21.7 and 19.5 metric tons of cocaine seizures, respectively.;The trafficking of South American cocaine through Nigeria and other West African countries en route to Europe continues. Though the cocaine does not come to the United States, the proceeds of the trafficking flow back to the same organizations that move cocaine to the United States, reinforcing their financial strength. Drug trafficking is a destabilizing force in the region and undermines good governance. Initially focused on Guinea and Guinea-Bissau, drug trafficking is now a serious issue facing nearly all West African countries. There is limited capacity in many West African law enforcement and judicial sectors to investigate and prosecute the organizers of cocaine trafficking. Despite this, there have been some important counternarcotics victories, most notably in the arrest and successful prosecution of traffickers in Sierra Leone.;Nigeria, which remains a significant transit point for narcotics destined for the United States, made demonstrable progress in 2008 by combating narcotics through increased budgetary support of key counternarcotics and corruption agencies, continued evaluation of suspicious transaction reports, and acceptable progress in the arrests of drug kingpins, with one kingpin arrested in 2008 and another in early 2009. Drug seizures were down slightly from a high in 2007. However, this development is likely attributable to a decrease in the use of Nigeria's international airports as a transshipment point after the successful deployment of narcotics scanning machines by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). At the same time, there was little progress in reform to expedite Nigerian extradition procedures, or to amend its Money Laundering Act to bring it in line with international standards. Cooperation between the NDLEA and U.S. law enforcement agencies remains robust.;International donors and organizations are working to assist West African governments in their counternarcotics efforts. The United States supports these efforts to preserve and protect stability and positive growth in this region.;The United States continues to maintain a strong and productive law enforcement relationship with Canada. Both countries are making significant efforts to disrupt the two-way flow of drugs, bulk currency, and other contraband. Canada remains a significant producer of MDMA (ecstasy) and high-potency marijuana that is trafficked to the United States. While Canada's passage of several additional regulations in recent years has reduced the large scale diversion and smuggling of bulk precursor chemicals across the border, the increasing diversion of these chemicals to the production of methamphetamine within Canada could lead to greater methamphetamine availability in the United States. The frequent mixing of methamphetamine and other illegal drugs into pills that are marketed as MDMA by Canada-based criminal groups poses a particularly significant public health risk in the United States. The United States Government is appreciative of Canada's efforts to address these and other drug-related challenges, including through bilateral initiatives and multilateral forums.;The Government of India maintains a credible record of regulating its licit opium grown for the production of pharmaceutical products through licensed opium farmers and monitoring of poppy cultivation sites. Diversion of licit opium crops into illegal markets continues despite India's determined efforts to control such activity. Illicit opium poppy production has also been observed in certain areas of the country, such as West Bengal and the State of Uttaranchal. Enforcement agencies continue to eradicate illicit opium poppy crops although the actual number of hectares destroyed has declined in recent years. Indian authorities have made marked efforts to control the illicit drug trade as opium and heroin smuggled from Afghanistan and Pakistan enters India across the India-Pakistan border and is trafficked to destinations outside of India.;Indian authorities continue to pursue precursor chemical trafficking organizations operating in the country and to cooperate with international law enforcement counterparts to interdict the flow of narcotics. The Government of India has made noteworthy international efforts to target the misuse of internet pharmacies for trafficking controlled and non-controlled pharmaceuticals. Law enforcement undertakings in this area have resulted in numerous arrests and asset seizures in both the United States and India.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this report under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;BARACK OBAMA</td></tr>

Buenas noches. Welcome to the White House. Tonight we are proud to host the third in a series of evenings celebrating the music that has helped define this Nation and helped define us as a people.;We began this tradition with jazz and country music. And tonight, as we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we are honored to be joined by some of this country's most successful and innovative performers of Latin music.;I want to thank Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Jose Feliciano, Pete Escovedo, Thalia, Tito El Bambino, Aventura, Los Lobos, and Sheila E. for performing tonight.;I also want to thank Jimmy Smits, Eva Longoria Parker, and George Lopez for joining us, and Maricel Presilla for serving as our guest chef and cooking us all this delicious food. Please give Maricel a big round of applause.;We have some other honored guests tonight: Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. I want to thank all the Members of Congress here tonight, including—especially the chairwoman of the Hispanic Caucus, Nydia Velazquez. Thank you for coming.;And finally I want to acknowledge somebody that we're all so proud of, our newest Justice of the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor.;Like our own Latino community, Latin music is not easy to define. Styles like Cuban salsa, Mexican norteno, Puerto Rican reggaeton and Dominican bachata are as vibrant and unique as the places they come from. But although Latin music takes many forms, this spirit of diversity also unifies us. At this—at its heart are the West African rhythms brought by slaves in the Caribbean, the guitars first carried to the New World by Spanish conquistadors. It incorporates the accordions played by German immigrants, the flutes and drums used by indigenous peoples, and the beats born in cities like New York and Miami.;And even though it's constantly evolving and changing, Latin music speaks to us in a language we can all understand: about hope and joy, sorrow and pain, friendship and love. It moves us, and it tends to make us move a little bit ourselves. [ Laughter ];In the end, what makes Latin music great is the same thing that's always made America great: the unique ability to celebrate our differences while creating something new, to realize that although we may come from different backgrounds and different cultures, what unites us will always be stronger than what divides us. In the words of Gloria Estefan who's here tonight, "The most beautiful things in this country have the flavor of other places.;And so to all of you who are watching this evening, either here or at home, please enjoy some truly global music from some of the most talented artists in the world.

Sections 501(1) and (4) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2461(1) and (4)), provide that, in affording duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the President shall have due regard for, among other factors, the effect such action will have on furthering the economic development of a beneficiary developing country and the extent of the beneficiary developing country's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. Section 502(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)) provides that, in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the President shall take into account various factors, including the country's level of economic development, the country's per capita gross national product, the living standards of its inhabitants, and any other economic factors he deems appropriate. Section 502(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)) authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act. Section 502(f)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)) requires the President to notify the Congress and the affected country, at least 60 days before termination, of the President's intention to terminate the affected country's designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.;2. Section 502(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(e)) provides that the President shall terminate the designation of a country as a beneficiary developing country if the President determines that such country has become a "high income" country as defined by the official statistics of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Termination is effective on January 1 of the second year following the year in which such determination is made.;3. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Croatia has become a "high income" country, and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.;4. Pursuant to section 502(e) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Equatorial Guinea has become a "high income" country, and I am terminating the designation of that country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, effective January 1, 2011.;5. Section 502(a)(2) (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(2)) of the 1974 Act provides that the President may designate any beneficiary developing country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, based on the considerations in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 19 U.S.C. 2462(c)).;6. Pursuant to section 502(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that Cape Verde should be removed from the list of least-developed beneficiary countries.;7. In Proclamation 8272 of June 30, 2008, the President determined that Trinidad and Tobago had become a "high income" country, and the designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP shall be terminated, effective January 1, 2010. I have determined that technical rectifications should be made to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect that determination.;8. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a)(1) of the 1974 Act, the President is authorized to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the GSP and to provide duty-free treatment for eligible articles from beneficiary developing counties.;9. In Proclamation 6813 of July 28, 1995, the President suspended the designation of the Republic of Maldives (Maldives) as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP.;10. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502(a) of the 1974 Act, and taking into account the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c), I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Maldives and to redesignate Maldives as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.;11. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Israel (the "USIFTA"), which the Congress approved in the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985 (the "USIFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 2112 note).;12. Section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act provides that, whenever the President determines that it is necessary to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, the President may proclaim such withdrawal, suspension, modification, or continuance of any duty, or such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties as the President determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA.;13. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to agricultural trade with Israel, on July 27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning certain aspects of trade in agricultural products during the period January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the "2004 Agreement").;14. In Presidential Proclamation 7826 of October 4, 2004, consistent with the 2004 Agreement, the President determined, pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.;15. On December 10, 2008, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2009, to allow additional time for the two governments to conclude an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.;16. In Presidential Proclamation 8334 of December 31, 2008, the President determined that it was necessary in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA to extend such duty-free treatment through December 31, 2009. In Proclamation 8334, the President modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. In Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, I further modified the HTS to provide the intended tariff treatment.;17. On December 6, 2009, the United States entered into a further agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2010, to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.;18. Pursuant to section 4(b) of the USIFTA Act, I have determined that it is necessary, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions with respect to Israel provided for by the USIFTA, to provide duty-free access into the United States through the close of December 31, 2010, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel.;19. Presidential Proclamation 6641 of December 15, 1993, implemented the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "NAFTA Implementation Act") (Public Law 103-182), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the NAFTA.;20. Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA.;21. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified the HTS to provide for modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.;22. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USSFTA. I have determined that certain rules of origin under the USSFTA were inadvertently deleted in the HTS and that technical rectifications to the HTS are necessary to restore the intended rules of origin.;23. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USCFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.;24. Presidential Proclamations 7987 of February 28, 2006, 7991 of March 24, 2006, 7996 of March 31, 2006, 8034 of June 30, 2006, 8111 of February 28, 2007, and 8331 of December 23, 2008, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the CAFTA-DR. Section 203(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "CAFTA-DR Act") (19 U.S.C. 4033) provides rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 3203(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV)) (as in effect on the date of enactment of the CAFTA-DR Act).;25. Presidential Proclamations 8097 of December 29, 2006, and 8240 of April 17, 2008, modified the HTS pursuant to section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) to conform it to amendments in the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the "Convention"). They contained certain modifications that affected the rules of origin under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Modifications to the HTS are necessary to conform the rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act to the Convention. I have determined that additional conforming changes to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin under the CAFTA-DR.;26. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act and section 4 of the USIFTA Act, do proclaim that;(1) The designation of Croatia as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2011.;(2) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) of the HTS is modified by deleting "Croatia" from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.;(3) The designation of Equatorial Guinea as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2011.;(4) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) of the HTS is modified by deleting "Equatorial Guinea" from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011. General note 4(b)(i) of the HTS is modified by deleting "Equatorial Guinea" from the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.;(5) In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of the designation of Cape Verde as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(b)(i) of the HTS is modified by deleting "Cape Verde" from the list of least-developed beneficiary developing countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2010.;(6) In order to reflect in the HTS the termination of the designation of Trinidad and Tobago as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, general note 4(d) and general note 4(a) to the HTS, and the Rate of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for HTS subheading 7411.21.50, are modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation.;(7) In order to reflect in the HTS the redesignation of Maldives as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP, general note 4(a) is modified by adding in alphabetical order "Maldives" to the list of "Independent Countries" and by adding in alphabetical order "Maldives" to the list of "Member Countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).;(8) In order to make technical corrections and rectifications necessary to provide the intended rules of origin under the NAFTA, the USSFTA, and the USCFTA, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.;(9) In order to reflect modifications to the HTS made to conform the rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act to the Convention, general note 29 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.;(10) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes I and II to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the respective annex.;(11) In order to implement U.S. tariff commitments under the 2004 Agreement through December 31, 2010, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex III to this proclamation.;(12)(a) The modifications to the HTS made by Annex III to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods that are the product of Israel and are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2010.;(b) The provisions of subchapter VIII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as modified by Annex III to this proclamation, shall continue in effect through December 31, 2010.;(13) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fourth.;BARACK OBAMA</td></tr>

I wanted to just make a brief statement on the latest situation in Haiti so that the American people are fully up to date on our efforts there.;This morning I spoke with President Preval of Haiti, who has been in regular contact with our Ambassador on the ground. I expressed to President Preval my deepest condolences for the people of Haiti and our strong support for the relief efforts that are underway.;Like so many Haitians, President Preval himself has lost his home, and his Government is working under extraordinarily difficult conditions. Many communications are down and remain--and many people remain unaccounted for. The scale of the devastation is extraordinary, as I think all of us are seeing on television, and the losses are heartbreaking.;I pledged America's continued commitment to the Government and the people of Haiti in the immediate effort to save lives and deliver relief and in the long-term effort to rebuild. President Preval and I agreed that it is absolutely essential that these efforts are well coordinated among the United States and the Government of Haiti, with the United Nations, which continues to play an essential role, and with the many international partners and aid organizations that are now on the ground.;Meanwhile, American resources continue to arrive in Haiti. Search and rescue efforts continue to work, pulling people out of the rubble. Our team has saved both the lives of American citizens and Haitian citizens, often under extraordinarily difficult circumstances.;Now, this morning the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson arrived, along with helicopters that will be critical in delivering assistance in the days to come. They are preparing to move badly needed water, food, and other lifesaving supplies to priority areas in Port-au-Prince. Food, water, and medicine continues to arrive, along with doctors and aid workers.;At the airport, help continues to flow in, not just from the United States, but from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, France, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic, among others. This underscores the point that I made to the President this morning: The entire world stands with the Government and the people of Haiti. For in Haiti's devastation, we all see the common humanity that we share.;And as the international community continues to respond, I do believe that America has a continued responsibility to act. Our Nation has a unique capacity to reach out quickly and broadly and to deliver assistance that can save lives.;That responsibility obviously is magnified when the devastation that's been suffered is so near to us. Haitians are our neighbors in the Americas, and for Americans, they are family and friends. It's characteristic of the American people to help others in time of such severe need. That's the spirit that we will need to sustain this effort as it goes forward.;There are going to be many difficult days ahead. So many people are in need of assistance. The port continues to be closed, and the roads are damaged. Food is scarce, and so is water. It will take time to establish distribution points so that we can ensure that resources are delivered safely and effectively and in an orderly fashion.;But I want the people of Haiti to know that we will do what it takes to save lives and to help them get back on their feet. In this effort, I want to thank our people on the ground: our men and women in uniform, who have moved so swiftly, our civilians and Embassy staff, many of whom suffered their own losses in this tragedy, and those members of search and rescue teams from Florida and California and Virginia, who've left their homes and their families behind to help others. To all of them: I want you to know that you demonstrate the courage and decency of the American people, and we are extraordinarily proud of you.;I also want to thank the American people more broadly. In these tough times, you've shown extraordinary compassion, already donating millions of dollars. I encourage all of you who want to help to do so through whitehouse.gov, where you can learn about how to contribute.;And tomorrow I will be meeting with President Clinton and President George W. Bush here at the White House to discuss how to enlist and help the American people in this recovery and rebuilding effort going forward.;I would note that as I ended my call with President Preval, he said that he has been extremely touched by the friendship and the generosity of the American people. It was an emotional moment. And this President, seeing the devastation around him, passed this message to the American people. He said, "From the bottom of my heart and on behalf of the people of Haiti, thank you, thank you, thank you.;As I told the President, we realize that he needs more help and his country needs more help, much more. And in this difficult hour, we will continue to provide it.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

In times of great challenge in our country and around the world, Americans have always come together to lend a hand and to serve others and to do what's right. That's what the American people have been doing in recent days with their extraordinary generosity and contributions to the Haitian people.;At this moment, we're moving forward with one of the largest relief efforts in our history, to save lives and to deliver relief that averts an even larger catastrophe. The two leaders with me today will ensure that this is matched by a historic effort that extends beyond our Government, because America has no greater resource than the strength and the compassion of the American people.;We just met in the Oval Office, an office they both know well. And I'm pleased that President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton have agreed to lead a major fundraising effort for relief, the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank both of you for returning to service and leading this urgent mission.;This is a model that works. After the terrible tsunami in Asia, President Bush turned to President Clinton and the first President Bush to lead a similar fund. That effort raised substantial resources for the victims of that disaster, money that helped save lives, deliver aid, and rebuild communities. And that's exactly what the people of Haiti desperately need right now.;Every day that goes by, we learn more about the horrifying scope of this catastrophe, destruction and suffering that defies comprehension: entire communities buried under mountains of concrete, families sleeping in the streets, injured desperate for care, many thousands feared dead. That's why thousands of American personnel, civilian and military, are on the scene working to distribute clean drinking water and food and medicine, and thousands of tons of emergency food supplies are arriving every day.;It will be difficult. It is an enormous challenge to distribute this aid quickly and safely in a place that has suffered such destruction. That's what we're focused on now, working closely with our partners, the Haitian Government, the United Nations, and many organizations and nations, friends from Argentina and France, from Dominican Republic and Brazil, and countries all around the world.;And Secretary Hillary Clinton will be in Haiti today to meet with President Preval and continue our close coordination with his Government. But we also know that our longer-term effort will not be measured in days and weeks, it will be measured in months and even years. And that's why it's so important to enlist and sustain the support of the American people. That's why it's so important to have a point of coordination for all the support that extends beyond our Government.;Here at home, Presidents Bush and Clinton will help the American people to do their part, because responding to a disaster must be the work of all of us. Indeed, those wrenching scenes of devastation remind us not only of our common humanity, but also of our common responsibilities. This time of suffering can and must be a time of compassion.;As the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: How can I help? In the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do: individuals, corporations, NGOs, and institutions. And I urge everyone who wants to help to visit www.clintonbushhaitifund.org.;We're fortunate to have the service of these two leaders. President Bush led America's response to the Asian tsunami, aid and relief that prevented even greater loss of life in the months after that disaster. And his administration's efforts to fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa treated more than 10 million men, women, and children.;As President, Bill Clinton helped restore democracy in Haiti. As a private citizen, he has helped to save the lives of millions of people around the world. And as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti, he understands intimately the daily struggles and needs of the Haitian people.;And by coming together in this way, these two leaders send an unmistakable message to the people of Haiti and to the people of the world: In these difficult hours, America stands united. We stand united with the people of Haiti, who have shown such incredible resilience, and we will help them to recover and to rebuild.;Yesterday we witnessed a small but remarkable display of that determination--some of you may have seen it--Haitians with little more than the clothes on their back marched peacefully through a ruined neighborhood, and despite all their loss and all their suffering, they sang songs of faith and songs of hope.;These are the people we're called upon to help. Those are the hopes that we're committed to answering. That's why the three of us are standing together today. And with that, I would invite each President to say a few words. I'm going to start with President Bush.;[At this point, former Presidents George W. Bush and William J. Clinton made brief remarks.];Well, these gentlemen are going to do an extraordinary job, but really what they're going to be doing is just tapping into the incredible generosity, the ingenuity, the can-do spirit of the American people in helping our neighbors in need. So I want to thank each of them not only for being here today, but what I know is going to be an extraordinary effort.;I want to make sure that everybody got that web site one more time. Obviously, we're just standing it up, but it will immediately give people a means to contact our offices: www.clintonbushhaitifund.org.;And I just want to amplify one thing that was said--we were talking in the back. In any extraordinary catastrophe like this, the first several weeks are just going to involve getting immediate relief on the ground. And there are going to be some tough days over the next several days. People are still trying to figure out how to organize themselves. There's going to be fear, anxiety, a sense of desperation in some cases.;I've been in contact with President Preval. I've been talking to the folks on the ground. We are going to be making slow and steady progress, and the key now is to--for everybody in Haiti to understand that there is going to be sustained help on the way.;But what these gentlemen are going to be able to do is when the news media starts seeing its attention drift to other things but there's still enormous needs on the ground, these two gentlemen of extraordinary stature, I think, are going to be able to help ensure that these efforts are sustained. And that's why it's so important and that's why I'm so grateful that they agreed to do it.;Thank you, gentlemen.</td></tr>

Please be seated. Good afternoon, everybody, and on behalf of the American people, I want to welcome President Preval, the First Lady, and their delegation to the United States. The President and I have just concluded a very productive meeting in the Oval Office on the urgent and overriding challenges before us: helping the people of Haiti as they recover and rebuild after one of the most devastating natural disasters ever to strike our hemisphere.;Mr. President, as I did when I spoke to you in those first days after the earthquake, I again want to express to you and to the Haitian people the deepest condolences of the American people. Your grief is shared by our strong and vibrant Haitian American community, some of whom join us here today and who continue to mourn the loss of their loved ones back in Haiti. To you and to our fellow Americans, please know that you remain in our thoughts and in our prayers.;The United States joins in mourning the loss of American citizens, as more than 100 Americans died in this earthquake, and our hearts also go out to their loved ones. We also remember that this natural disaster was an international tragedy, taking the lives of Dominican s and Canadians, French, Brazilians, and people from dozens of nations around the world.;President Preval and his delegation offered an update on the status of relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts, the progress so far, and the daunting challenges ahead in a disaster that, even now, defies comprehension. To offer just some perspective on the awful scale of Haitian loss, it's as if the United States, in a terrible instant, lost nearly 8 million people. Or, it's as if one-third of our country, 100 million Americans, suddenly had no home, no food or water. That gives you a sense of, relative to the populations, what has happened in Haiti. No nation could respond to such a catastrophe alone. It would require a global response. And that's exactly what we have seen these past 2 months.;Mr. President, even as you and other Haitian leaders have endured your personal tragedies--losing your own homes, your loved ones--you have carried on with great courage and determination. You've persevered, leading an international effort with critical support from the United Nations, many partner nations, and countless nongovernmental organizations. Representatives of some of the NGOs are here today, and for the extraordinary work that you've done to uplift lives every day, in Haiti and around the world, often at great risk to your own lives, we salute you as well.;In this international response, the United States has been proud to play a leading role. Mr. President, we are joined today by men and women representing all the Americans who answered Haiti's call in its hours of need, including Members of Congress and many State and local officials, who we thank for their support, and leaders from across my administration: the Department of State, USAID, Homeland Security, FEMA, Health and Human Services, Transportation, and the Department of Defense, including our great folks at Southern Command. Today I want to thank all of them for leading a swift and coordinated response during one of the most complex humanitarian efforts ever attempted.;We're joined by Ambassador Ken Merten and some of our heroic Embassy staff, who worked around the clock. We're joined by our disaster response teams, who were on the scene within 24 hours, our military personnel, who quickly reopened the airport and the port, making way for a massive humanitarian effort, our search-and-rescue teams, who crawled into the rubble to pull survivors out to safety, Haitian and American, the volunteer physicians and nurses and paramedics, who treated tens of thousands of patients with life-threatening injuries, and all our men and women in uniform, who have helped to distribute desperately needed food and water and medicine to millions of people--our remarkable soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen.;I just want to personally say how extraordinarily proud I am of each and every one of you, because I think you represent what's best in America. And I could not be prouder of the response that all of you were engaged in during this humanitarian crisis.;Now, no relief effort of this magnitude is without its difficulties, but there should be absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind, along with their Haitian and international partners, these men and women made a difference. They saved lives--countless lives--of men and women and children.;So, Mr. President, if you will permit us this moment to briefly express once again our admiration for all those who stepped forward, who volunteered, who represent the true character of our country, and who projected to the world the best face of America, a face of compassion and generosity. Each and every one of you can take enormous pride at your service, and every single American thanks you for making us so proud.;I also want to acknowledge the enormous generosity of so many individual Americans who gave what they could to support Haiti, even in difficult economic times. That help makes possible an extraordinary response from the courageous and capable nongovernmental organizations that have been at the scene and that support all kinds of efforts that the Government is engaged in. And I know that the support of the American people will continue to be essential as Haiti tries to recover and rebuild.;As President Preval and I discussed, the situation on the ground remains dire, and people should be under no illusions that the crisis is over. Many Haitians are still in need, desperate need in some cases, of shelter and food and medicine. And with the spring rains approaching, those needs will only grow. The challenge now is to prevent a second disaster.;And that's why, at this very moment, thousands of Americans, both civilian and military, remain on the scene at the invitation of the Haitian Government. And that's why, even as the U.S. military responsibly hands off relief functions to our Haitian and international partners, America's commitment to Haiti's recovery and reconstruction must endure and will endure. This pledge is one that I made at the beginning of this crisis, and I intend for America to keep our pledge. America will be your partner in the recovery and reconstruction effort.;Toward that end, the international donors' conference at the United Nations later this month will be an opportunity--an important opportunity for all parties. Haiti can lead the way and will lead the way with a strong vision for its future. The international community can pledge the resources that will be necessary for a coordinated and sustained effort. And working together, we can ensure that assistance not simply delivers relief for the short term, but builds up Haiti's capacity to deliver basic services and provide for the Haitian people over the long term.;So, Mr. President, in the face of devastation that shocked the world, the people of Haiti responded with resolve and faith that inspired the world, in song and in prayer and in the determination to carry on. As you declared during last month's national day of mourning, "It is time to wipe away the tears, it is time for Haiti to rebuild.;And to you and to the Haitian people, I say today, as you embark on the heavy work ahead, you will continue to have a steady and reliable partner in the United States of America.;So with that, let me turn this over to President Preval.;President Preval. Mr. President, dear friends in Congress, members of the organizations that helped Haiti in this moment of need, the Haitians of Washington: The damages caused in Haiti by the earthquake of January 12, 2010, are unimaginable. But the response from the international community--from Asia to Africa, from the United States, from Canada, from all of Latin America, from the Caribbean, from Europe, all the way to the Middle East--this response, thanks to its swiftness, thanks to its size, was commensurate with the disaster.;Today, here and now, I would like to thank the American people, I would like to thank Congress, I would like to thank the administration, and you, in particular, Mr. President, as well as your wife, not only for the material aid, but also for the moral support, the psychological support that helped us realize that we were not alone and that provide us great comfort in our distress.;You, thanks to your statements, sent a message to all of those who provided help to Haiti, needless for me to repeat that which you said. So I would like to thank you for having made it possible for these people to come to help us.;Mr. President, for me, this is also an opportunity to express my sympathy, my condolences, to all of the American families for whom members of their families were killed, injured in Haiti during this earthquake.;Dear friends, we must draw the lessons from what occurred in Haiti. These are lessons for all of mankind. The Haiti earthquake was immediately followed by the earthquake in Chile, as well as other earthquakes throughout the world. And the countries that have seismic risks are not merely those countries which are located on top of seismic faults. In fact, the tsunamis, which are the repercussions of break in faults, threaten other regions as well as the United States.;In addition to earthquakes and tsunamis, global warming is a major concern for the entire planet. We must draw the lessons from what occurred in Haiti. The massive, spontaneous, generous help was a good response to the disaster, however, its effectiveness must be improved, because effectiveness depends on the quality of coordination.;This is why I support the idea of the creation of so-called red helmets within the United Nations, and these would be an observatory, a warning system, a provision system for natural disaster and a humanitarian force which would be the equivalent of the blue helmets. It was proposed that there should be so-called red helmets, a humanitarian force in order to intervene and that would work in a coordinated manner as soon as the first minutes after a disaster, which are fundamental to saving lives.;Mr. President, during our meeting, I mentioned what Haiti's preoccupations and priorities were. Our priorities are, first and foremost, as you said, protection of those people who today are homeless and who must be relocated. And in parallel, we must prepare the rainy season, which just last week has already caused the deaths of 15 people.;And at the same time, much more basically, we must deal with the need of rebuilding Haiti, thanks to an effective decentralization policy, namely offering health care, education, jobs to all Haitians, men and women, regardless of where they live in the country, in order to prevent migratory flows towards the big cities, towards Port-au-Prince, and that will help avoid that disaster such as the earthquake would cause so many victims.;On March 31, there will be at the United Nations an international conference in order to support the reconstruction of Haiti. I do hope that all participants will share this philosophy, this vision, of decentralization.;And at the same time, just as the first-responders, I do recommend the concept of a coordination via the creation of a trust fund, a donors trust fund, whose implementation would be done--followed according to a unique procedure carried out by one executing agency. We talked about this, and I do know that we can already count on your support to be the advocate of that idea during this conference in support of our vision.;Thank you very much.</td></tr>

On August 5, 2004, the United States entered into the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the "Agreement") with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

Hello, everybody. Good afternoon. President Fernandez and I just had an excellent conversation. We first met and, I think, forged a good working relationship and friendship at the Summit of the Americas last year. And we have built on that relationship, as have our respective administrations, on a whole host of issues.;We had a wide-ranging discussion. One of the first messages I wanted to deliver was my appreciation for the role that the Dominican Republic played in helping the international community respond to the crisis in Haiti after the devastating earthquake there. And I think that the Dominican Republic's role, President Fernandez's role in particular, in helping to facilitate a rapid response was extraordinarily important. It saved lives, and it continues, as we look at how we can reconstruct and rebuild in Haiti in a way that is good not only for the people of Haiti, but also good for the region as a whole.;That was just one example of the leadership that President Fernandez has shown. He and his Government have been extremely helpful in resolving the political crisis that existed in Honduras. And we discussed ways that we can manage that process so that Honduras can once again be fully integrated into the regional groupings and organizations and--in a way that is respectful of democracy, and we coordinated closely between our two countries on that issue.;We discussed the critical issue of drug trafficking and crime and how that has the potential to be destabilizing throughout the region. And we have already seen great cooperation between our countries through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, but more needs to be done. And so President Fernandez and I discussed how we can do a better job coordinating through multinational groupings to address what is a scourge on so many countries. And that involves us dealing both with the supply side of the equation, but also the demand side. And as I've said before in conversations, for example, with President Calderon in Mexico, we here in the United States have an important obligation to make sure that we are dealing with the demand of drugs. There are also cross-border flows that involve guns and weapons and cash. So the problem involves all of us, and if we're going to solve it, we're going to have to work coordinating together.;And we also talked about how working together we can expand trade opportunities, commercial opportunities, business opportunities. One area that I expressed to the President that is of particular interest to me is clean energy. Last year, when I met with President Lula of Brazil, I noted that Brazil had made enormous progress around clean energy, sugarcane-based ethanol, the possibilities of real energy independence in the region. I think those same opportunities exist for the Dominican Republic. And President Fernandez and I discussed how we can work more closely together around energy security issues, something that my administration is very interested in partnering with Central American and Latin American countries to work on.;So the main message I have to the people of the Dominican Republic is thank you for your friendship. I think the American people appreciate greatly the bonds between our two countries, bonds that express themselves obviously in our extraordinary Dominican population, Dominican American population, that we have here in this country. And obviously, I've got to note that we got some pretty good baseball players here from the Dominican Republic.;President Fernandez. Yes, sir.;President Obama. But for some reason I've got a lot of Red Sox fans here, so they keep on talking about Ortiz, but I'm a White Sox guy.;But, Mr. President, welcome. Thank you for your friendship. And we look forward to a long and constructive relationship between not only our countries but our two governments.;President Fernandez. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, first of all, I would like to thank President Obama for extending an invitation to come here to the White House and speak on issues that are of mutual interest for the U.S. Government and for the Dominican Republic. As the President has indicated, we have agreed on several issues, some bilateral issues between the U.S. and the Dominican Republic, and also on regional issues.;We do appreciate, Mr. President, that with all you have on your agenda, with all the international issues, with all the crises, with the economic situation that's affecting worldwide, you have put on your agenda the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Dominican Republic. I think this is evidence that you do have an interest for the region and the problems that affect not only the Dominican Republic, but the region as a whole.;As you have indicated, one of our major concerns has to do with drug trafficking, with transnational crime, with violence related to all these criminal activities. I think that the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative has been the right path forward. I commend you for that, Mr. President. And I think now we should move into a more collaborative environment with the other Caribbean nations, Central America, and Mexico. It is only by coordinating our efforts that we can really defeat this epidemic that has become overwhelming to all of our countries. And whatever we can do from the supply side, as you said, or the demand side, will be of great significance for the safety and security of our people.;Other issues, like you said, related to clean energy, we're working on that in the Dominican Republic with wind energy and with the potential production of ethanol in our country. We'll move on also with trade. We have a free trade agreement between both of our countries, of which we have not benefited fully because of the global financial crisis and how it has affected trade. But we can look into the future hopefully that we will increase our trade activities and more investment coming from the U.S. into the Dominican Republic.;So once again, Mr. President, I thank you for your friendship, I thank you for your vision, for your leadership, and for your commitment to the region and the Dominican Republic.;President Obama. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.</td></tr>

Thank you very much. Thank you to Senator Menendez and to the chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congresswoman Velazquez, for those extraordinary introductions, but more importantly, for the outstanding work that you do each and every day. Please give them a huge round of applause. Thank you to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute for inviting us this evening. Michelle and I are thrilled to be here with so many friends to kick off Hispanic Heritage Month.;I want to acknowledge a few people before I begin my remarks. First, somebody who I believe is going to go down in history as one of the greatest Speakers of the House of all time, Nancy Pelosi is here. Two of our outstanding Cabinet Secretaries are in the house, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and our wonderful Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis.;I want to thank our mistress of ceremonies, Soledad O'Brien. I want to congratulate Eva Longoria Parker and Arturo Sandoval and Lin-Manuel Miranda on your well-deserved awards this evening.;Audience member. We love you, Obama!;The President. I love you back! And I want to thank all the Members of Congress, the local elected officials, the CHCI alumni, and all who work day in and day out to advance the Hispanic community and America as a whole.;I also want to acknowledge and thank all of the outstanding Latino leaders serving across my administration, because I am proud that the number of Latinos I've nominated to Senate-confirmed positions at this point far exceeds any administration in history. And I'm especially proud that a whole bunch of them are Latinas. And as I've said before, one of my proudest moments of my Presidency was the day Justice Sonia Sotomayor swore an oath and ascended to our Nation's highest court and sparked new dreams for countless young girls all across America.;Now, some of you may remember, I first joined you here 2 years ago, as a candidate for this office. And we spoke then about how, after years of failed policies here in Washington, after decades of putting off the toughest challenges, we had finally reached a tipping point, a point where the fundamental promise of America was at risk.;We talked about how these challenges impacted the Latino community, but also about how they're bigger than any one community. I said then that if a young child is stuck in an overcrowded and underperforming school, it doesn't matter if she is Black or White or Latino, she is our child, and we have a responsibility to her, that if millions of Latinos end up in the emergency room because they don't have health care, it's not just a problem for one community, it's a problem for all of America. When millions of immigrants toil in the shadows of our society, that's not just a Latino problem, that is a American problem. We've got to solve it.;As Dr. King told Cesar Chavez all those years ago: Our separate struggles are really one. And that truth became painfully clear when, less than a week after I had appeared before the CHC, some of the biggest Wall Street firms collapsed and the bottom fell out of our economy. Millions of families across America were plunged into the deepest recession of our lifetimes. And a Latino community that had been hard hit before the recession was hit even harder.;So when I took office, I insisted that we could only rebuild our economy if we started growing the economy for all of our people, not just some of our people, if we provided economic security for all of our working families all across America. We had to renew the fundamental idea that everybody in America--everybody in America--has a chance to make it if they try, no matter who they are, no matter what they look like, no matter where they come from or where they were born.;That's the idea that drives us: the chance to make of our lives what we will. And I know that many of you are thinking tonight about a task that is central to that idea, and that's our fight to pass comprehensive immigration reform.;Now, I know that many of you campaigned hard for me, and understandably, you're frustrated that we have not been able to move this over the finish line yet. I am too. But let me be clear: I will not walk away from this fight. My commitment is getting this done as soon as we can. We can't keep kicking this challenge down the road.;Now, there's no doubt the debate over how to fix all this has been a fractured and sometimes painful one in this country. And let's face it, there are some who seek political advantage in distorting the facts and in dividing our people. We've seen it before. Some take advantage of the economic anxiety that people are feeling to stoke fear of those who look or think or worship differently, to inflame passions between "us" and "them.;I have news for those people. It won't work. There is no "us" and "them." In this country, there is only "us." There is no Latino America or Black America or White America or Asian America. There is only the United States of America--all of us. All of us joined together, indivisible.;If we appeal to the American people's hopes over their fears, we'll get this done. We already know what this reform looks like. Just a few years ago, when I was a Senator, we built a bipartisan coalition around a basic framework under the leadership of Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain and President Bush. We rallied with leaders from the business community and the labor communities and the religious communities. Many of you were there. And the bill we forged wasn't perfect. It wasn't what any one person might think was optimal.;But because folks were willing to compromise, we came up with a commonsense, comprehensive reform that was so far from the false debates, the notion that somehow on the one hand there's mass amnesty or on the other hand there's some unworkable mass deportation. That wasn't what we were talking about. And the American people, I think, were ready to embrace a commonsense solution. And we passed that bill through the United States Senate.;But since that effort fall apart--fell apart, we have seen how broken and bitter and divisive our politics has become. Today, the folks who yell the loudest about the Federal Government's long failure to fix this problem are some of the same folks standing in the way of good faith efforts to fix it. And under the pressures of partisanship and election-year politics, most of the 11 Republican Senators who voted for that reform just 4 years ago have backed far away from that vote today.;That's why States like Arizona have taken matters into their own hands. And my administration has challenged that State's law, not just because it risks the harassment of citizens and legal immigrants, but it is the wrong way to deal with this issue. It interferes with Federal immigration enforcement. It makes it more difficult for law--local law enforcement to do its job. It strains State and local budgets. And if other States follow suit, we'll have an unproductive and unworkable patchwork of laws across the country.;We need an immigration policy that works, a policy that meets the needs of families and businesses while honoring our tradition as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws. We need it for the sake of our economy, we need it for our security, and we need it for our future.;And I understand it may not be the easy thing to do politically. It's easier to grandstand. But I didn't run for President to do what's easy. I ran to do what's hard. I ran to do what's right. And when I think something is the right thing to do, even my critics have to admit I'm pretty persistent. I won't let it go. They can call me a lot of things, but they know I don't give up.;Now, the Senate is going to have a chance to do the right thing over the next few weeks when Senator Reid brings the "DREAM Act" to the floor. Keep in mind, in the past, this was a bill that was supported by a majority of Democrats and Republicans. There's no reason why it shouldn't receive that same kind of bipartisan support today. I've been a supporter since I was in the Senate, and I will do whatever it takes to support the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's efforts to pass this bill so that I can sign it into law on behalf of students seeking a college education and those who wish to serve in our country's uniform. It's the right thing to do. We should get it done.;Now, I want to be straight with you. To make real progress on these or any issues, we've got to break the Republican leadership's blockade. Let's be clear about this: Without the kind of bipartisan effort we had just a few short years ago, we can't get these reforms across the finish line. Their leadership has made reaching 60 votes the norm for nearly everything the Senate has to do. The American people's business is on hold because, simply put, the other party's platform has been "no.;For example, consider the public servants I've nominated to carry out the people's business. Most of them had been supported widely and approved unanimously by Senate committees. But they've been held up for months by the Republican leadership. We can't even get an up-or-down vote on their confirmation. I nominated a man that you all know well.;Audience member. Salazar!;The President. Well, I did nominate Salazar. I got him confirmed. [ Laughter ] Raul Yzaguirre, to be our Ambassador to the Dominican Republic--Raul is right here. Now, Raul has been waiting for 10 months to be the Ambassador to the Dominican Republic. Right now there are 21 judges who've been held up for months while their courts have sat empty. Three of them are outstanding Latinos, like Judge Albert Diaz, who I nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court. He's been waiting for 10 months. This is a widely respected State court judge, military judge, and Marine Corps attorney. He was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. But just last month, the Senate Republican leader objected to a vote on his confirmation yet again. And when he was asked why, he basically admitted it was simply partisan payback. Partisan payback.;We can't afford that kind of game-playing right now. We need serious leaders for serious times. That's the kind of leadership this moment demands. That is what we need right now. Because when I get out of this town and I'm meeting with people, talking to folks, nobody is asking me, "Hey, Barack, which party is scoring more points?" Nobody is saying, "Oh, don't worry about us, I just want you to do what's best for November.;What they're interested in is how they're going to find a job when they've only known one trade their whole life, how are they going to put their kids through school, how are they going to pay the bills if they get sick, how are they going to retire when their savings have plunged after this financial crisis. They're the folks we're here for. They're the folks we're fighting for.;That's why we passed Wall Street reform for every hard-working family who's tired of taken--getting taken advantage of every time they opened their credit card bill or mortgage payment or tried to send a remittance--send a payment to help their parents or families abroad.;That's why we're reforming America's schools so that all our children have a chance to learn the skills they need for today's economy. We eliminated tens of billions of dollars in wasteful subsidies to big banks that provide student loans, and we're taking that money to make college affordable for millions of students, including more than a hundred thousand Latino students. That's what the CHC did. That's what this administration did.;That's why we passed health insurance reform for Americans who are sick of being gouged by insurance companies that jack up rates and deny coverage because you've got a preexisting condition. Now millions of Americans with insurance can get free preventive care. Now 9 million Latinos and tens of millions of Americans will be able to afford quality health care for the first time.;That's why we cut taxes for small-business owners and 95 percent of working Americans.;Audience member. Puerto Rico bless you, Obama!;The President. Thank you. Instead of giving tax breaks to corporations to create jobs overseas, we're cutting taxes for companies that put our people to work here at home. Instead of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them, we're fighting to cut taxes for you, middle class folks all across the country. That's what we're about. That's what we're fighting for.;And when it comes to just about everything we've tried to do, almost every Republican in Congress has folded their arms and said no. Even where we usually agree, they say no. They're thinking about the next election instead of the next generation, trying to score political points instead of solving problems. They said no to help for small businesses, no to middle class tax cuts, no to making college affordable, no to comprehensive immigration reform. Their platform, apparently, is "No, se puede." [ Laughter ] Is that a bumper sticker you want on your car?;Audience members. No! [ Laughter ];The President. In fact, the chairman of their campaign committee said that if they take over, they'd go back to "the exact same agenda"--that's a quote--"the exact same agenda" they had when they were in power. They're saying they'll repeal Wall Street reform. They'll try to repeal health insurance reform. They'll give the special interests a pen and let them write the rules again.;And right now, because of that Republican blockade, those special interests--even foreign corporations--can spend tens of millions of dollars on campaign ads without even having to disclose who they are. You've seen some of these ads. You know, they call themselves Americans for Apple Pie or Moms for Motherhood. [ Laughter ];And then they use their voice to drown out yours, to let Wall Street write rules that take advantage of Main Street, to let insurance companies write rules that let them cover or drop folks whenever and however they please, to go back to that "exact same agenda.;Well, let me tell you something. That agenda didn't work out so well for the Latino community. It didn't work out for anybody here in America. It is not going to solve the challenges we face. We can't go backwards. We've got to go forwards.;So let me say this, not just to the folks who are in this room, but to the Latino community across this country. You have every right to keep the heat on me and keep the heat on the Democrats, and I hope you do. That's how our political process works.;But don't forget who is standing with you and who is standing against you. Don't ever believe that this election coming up doesn't matter. Don't forget who secured health care for 4 million children, including the children of legal immigrants. Don't forget who won new Pell grants for more than 100,000 Latino students. Don't forget who fought for credit card reform, a new agency to protect consumers from predatory lending, and protections for folks who send remittances back home. Don't forget who cut taxes for working families. Don't forget who your friends are. No se olviden. Don't forget.;We can't go back now. Not when there is so much work to be done. We've got to move forward. We've got to move forward on jobs and on the economy and on immigration reform and all the unfinished business of our time. These are serious times. They require serious leaders and serious citizens, and your voice matters. Your voice can make the difference.;So let me close by saying this. Long before America was even an idea, this land of plenty was home to many peoples, to British and French, to Dutch and Spanish, to Mexican, to countless Indian tribes. We all shared the same land. We didn't always get along. But over the centuries, what eventually bound us together, what made us all Americans, was not a matter of blood, it wasn't a matter of birth. It was faith and fidelity to the shared values that we all hold so dear: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed with certain inalienable rights: life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.;That's what makes us unique. That's what makes us strong. The ability to recognize our common humanity, to remember that in this country, equality and opportunity are not just words on a piece of paper, they're not just words in the mouths of politicians, they are promises to be kept.;And that is our calling now: to keep those promises for the next generation. No matter which way the political winds shift, I will stand with you for that better future. And if you stand with me, and if we remember that fundamental truth--that divided we fall, but united we are strong, and out of many, we are one--then you and I will finish what we have started. We will make sure that America forever remains an idea and a place that's big enough and bold enough and brave enough to accommodate the dreams of all our children and all our people for years to come. Si, se puede.;Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.</td></tr>

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Accompanying this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that continued support for bilateral programs in Bolivia and limited programs in Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.;Afghanistan continues to be the world's largest producer of opium poppies and a major source of heroin. The United States Government recognized the Government of Afghanistan's ongoing commitment to combat narcotics and the range of initiatives undertaken in this regard under the auspices of the government of President Karzai. A noteworthy achievement is the reduction of opium poppy cultivation from 157,000 hectares in 2008, to 131,000 hectares in 2009, a 17 percent decline.;The connections between opium production, the resulting narcotics trade, corruption, and the insurgency continue to be among the most challenging obstacles to reducing the drug threat in Afghanistan. Poppy cultivation remains largely confined to provinces in the south and west where security problems greatly impede counternarcotics efforts. Nearly all significant poppy cultivation occurs in insecure areas with active insurgent elements, although progress has been made in stabilizing these regions. Nevertheless, the country must demonstrate even greater political will and programmatic effort to combat opium trafficking and production nationwide.;Pakistan is a major transit country for opiates and hashish for markets around the world, especially for narcotics originating in Afghanistan. Pakistan also is a major transit country for precursor chemicals illegally smuggled to Afghanistan where they are used to process heroin.;Pakistan is still challenged by extremist groups who have power over parts of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, particularly where most of Pakistan's poppy is grown. These extremist groups are also found in settled areas of the Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province such as its capital, Peshawar, and the Swat Valley. The Government of Pakistan is forced to divert law enforcement resources and equipment from poppy eradication efforts to address these incursions.;The Government of Pakistan remains concerned about opium poppy cultivation in Pakistan and is working to return to opium poppy-free status soon. A joint U.S.-Pakistan survey in 2009 estimated that 1,779 hectares of opium poppies were under cultivation in Pakistan, approximately 130 hectares less than was under cultivation in the country during the previous year.;The range of U.S.-Pakistan initiatives, which include programs to defeat the insurgency on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and prevent terrorist safe-havens, have the spin-off effect of helping Pakistan to fortify its land borders and seacoast against drug trafficking and terrorists, support expanded regional cooperation, and encourages Pakistan to return to opium poppy-free status. United States Government support focuses especially on upgrading the institutional capacity of Pakistan's law enforcement agencies.;Although Brazil no longer qualifies as a major drug transit country to the United States, narcotics control in this country which occupies such a large landmass in the hemisphere is of serious concern. Dynamic drug trafficking trends from Brazil are directed primarily at other countries, especially to and through Africa, and onward to Europe. For example, seizures of maritime vessels that departed Brazil in 2009, primarily to European destinations, recorded an unprecedented 2.2 metric tons of cocaine. With its vast terrain and shared borders with so many other countries, Brazil faces unique challenges in terms of patrolling so much illegal land, air, and sea activity. Brazil is seeking to reduce its growing domestic drug use at home, especially the use of cocaine, cocaine base, and crack cocaine, primarily from Bolivia, and marijuana. The United States recognizes Brazil's emergence as a forward-leaning regional leader for cooperation among neighboring states to thwart drug production, trafficking, and use. Like all hemispheric countries, it is important for Brazil to place narcotics and crime control at the top of its national security agenda to thwart these negative influences.;As Mexico and Colombia continue to apply pressure on drug traffickers, the countries of Central America are increasingly targeted for trafficking of cocaine and other drugs primarily destined for the United States. This growing problem resulted in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua meeting the threshold for inclusion in the Majors List. Panama and Guatemala, already on the Majors List, are especially vulnerable because of their geographic location. Enhanced and effective counternarcotics measures are needed to thwart smugglers from moving illegal drugs through the seven countries on the isthmus, as well as the waters along the region's long Atlantic and Pacific coastlines between the coca producing Andes to the south and determined and flexible criminal trafficking organizations based in Mexico. United States Government support through the Central American Regional Security Initiative provides Central American countries with the opportunity to boost their rule of law institutions and promote greater regional law enforcement cooperation to counter drug trafficking and transnational organized crime.;United States and international data show a continued strengthening of illegal drug trafficking between Latin America and West Africa, especially via Brazil and Venezuela, with a considerable portion of illegal product destined for Europe. Nigeria, a worldwide drug trafficking focal point, makes counternarcotics a top national security concern for the country, but Nigeria's efforts are often thwarted by lack of resources, institutional capability, and corruption. A number of U.S. projects in Nigeria and other West African countries are aimed at building limited capacity to investigate and prosecute organized drug traffickers.;Drug traffickers continue to move significant quantities of cocaine through West Africa. For example, Gambian officials recently discovered over two tons of cocaine being stockpiled in the country. The crash of a Boeing 727 in Mali, which was believed to be carrying cocaine, points to new trafficking methods being used in the region. Drug trafficking remains a threat to security, good governance, and increasingly, public health in West Africa. Many countries in the region have weak criminal justice institutions and are vulnerable to corruption. The facilitation of drug trafficking by government officials continues to be a significant challenge, especially in Guinea-Bissau. The United States is encouraged that some countries are actively investigating illegal drug traffickers. Liberia, for example, worked closely with the United States to arrest suspects and deliver them into U.S. custody to stand trial.;The assistance of international donors and organizations to West African governments to improve their counternarcotics capability is increasingly urgent. The United States fully supports all efforts to promote, preserve, and protect the stability and positive growth of countries in West Africa.;The United States continues to maintain a strong and productive law enforcement relationship with Canada. Both countries are making significant efforts to disrupt the two-way flow of drugs, bulk currency, and other contraband. Canadian criminal groups continue to produce large quantities of MDMA (ecstasy) and high-potency marijuana that is trafficked to the United States. The frequent mixing of methamphetamine and other unknown substances into pills marketed as MDMA by Canada-based criminal groups poses an emerging public health risk in the United States, as well as in Canada.;The stealth with which both natural and synthetic drugs including marijuana, MDMA, and methamphetamine are produced in Canada and trafficked to the United States, makes it extremely difficult to measure the overall impact of such transshipments from this shared border country, although U.S. law enforcement agencies record considerable seizures of these substances from Canada.;At the same time, the Drug Enforcement Administration reports that of the amount of MDMA seized in the United States, about half was traced to Canada as its country of origin in 2009.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;BARACK OBAMA</td></tr>

Everybody, please be seated. Welcome to the White House, everybody. Thank you, Javier, for that outstanding introduction. I will not play you chess. [ Laughter ] You may not have won at the nationals, but you'd beat me. [ Laughter ] And then Malia and Sasha would laugh about it. [ Laughter ] We are very proud of you, and we're glad you are here.;Thank you also to the University of Texas-Pan American Mariachis that performed for us. And hello to everybody across the country participating in watch parties and in education reform efforts in your own communities. It's precisely that kind of participation--engaging the American people, giving all of you more say in the policies that affect your lives, and holding ourselves accountable to deliver real results in return--that is at the heart of a new Executive order I'm about to sign to strengthen the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics.;Now, before I sign this document, I'd like to acknowledge a few people who have been and will continue to be instrumental to our success: our Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education, Thelma Melendez de Santa Ana, our Assistant Secretary for Post-Secondary Education, Eduardo Ochoa, and our Assistant Deputy Secretary, Rosalinda Barrera.;I also want to thank Eduardo Padron, the president of Miami Dade Community College, who has been a leader in my administration's efforts to strengthen America's community colleges. And because that's not enough, in addition to running a community college, he's also agreed to serve as the Chair of this initiative's Presidential advisory commission. So we are grateful to you. This will be a group of 30 Latino leaders who are going to make sure that, when it comes to our children's education, my administration hears the voices of the Latino community loud and clear.;And I also want to give a special recognition to our recently confirmed Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Raul Yzaguirre. It was Raul's vision and tenacious commitment to equal education for all our people that helped this initiative become a reality back in 1990 under George H.W. Bush. And so we are very proud that he is here today to see that his work continues.;The question then back in 1990 is the same question we face now: How do we best improve educational opportunities and outcomes for our Hispanic students? Over the past year and a half, under Juan Sepulveda's leadership--and Juan, thank you for your outstanding work--over the last year and a half, this initiative has worked to gather the answers from those who know best, people in communities across this country. Juan hosted more than a hundred conversations. He's taken comments from more than 10,000 Americans. And he's worked with leaders from more than 30 States, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, to come up with real solutions that work best for our kids.;We know why this is so important. Today, Latinos make up the largest minority group in America's schools--more than one in five students overall--and they face challenges of monumental proportions. Latino students are more likely to attend our lowest performing schools, more likely to learn in larger class sizes, more likely to drop out at higher rates. Fewer than half take part in early childhood education. Only about half graduate on time from high school. And those who do make it to college often find themselves underprepared for its rigors. In just a single generation, America has fallen from first to ninth in college completion rates for all our students.;Now, this is not just a Latino problem, this is an American problem. We've got to solve it because if we allow these trends to continue, it won't just be one community that falls behind, we will all fall behind together. At a time when the unemployment rate for Americans who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have gone to college, when most of the new jobs that are being created require some higher education, when other countries are outeducating us today to outcompete us tomorrow, making sure that we offer all our kids, regardless of race, a world-class education is more than a moral obligation. It is an economic imperative if we want to succeed in the 21st century.;And that's why, when I took office, I set two big goals for American education. One was to make sure all our students, like the ones who are here with us today, receive a complete and competitive education from cradle to career. And number two, by the year 2020--the year Javier will graduate from college--America will once again have a higher share of college graduates than any other nation on Earth. That is our goal.;Now, improving educational outcomes for the Hispanic community is critical to reaching these overall goals. And reaching these goals is behind every battle that we've waged on behalf of our children's education since I took office.;We are expanding and reforming early childhood education so that our children aren't behind by the time they reach the schoolhouse door. We're challenging programs that don't measure up to compete for their funding, because if you're receiving tax dollars, you'd better be able to deliver results for our children.;We've launched a Race to the Top encouraging States to change their schools from the bottom up for all our children, Black, White, and Latino alike. Already, 48 States and DC have competed to raise standards, improve curricula, and turn around struggling schools. And we'll take steps to recruit and train more good teachers, including bilingual teachers.;We're tackling the dropout crisis that affects the Hispanic community more than any other community. And we're challenging States and communities to turn around our 5,000 worst schools, including many of the ones that produce the most Latino and African American dropouts.;To reach the second goal that I've set, leading the world in the proportion of college graduates, we're offering middle class families the American opportunity tax credit, which is a tax credit worth up to $2,500 a year that's already helped put the dream of a college degree within the reach of more than 12 million students from working families.;We're upgrading our community colleges so that we can link students looking for work with businesses looking to hire. We're funding and implementing the post-9/11 GI bill so our veterans, including our outstanding Latino veterans, can come home to the same chance to earn a college education as my grandfather had when he came back from World War II.;We're eliminating $60 billion over the next decade in wasteful giveaways to banks that profited from a broken student loan system, and we're using that money to make college more affordable for millions of students. In fact, we estimate that these steps will make college more affordable for more than 150,000 additional Latino students.;And as I've said before, Congress should finally pass the " DREAM Act." I've supported this bill--[ applause ]--I have supported this bill for years, and I'll do everything it takes to sign it into law on behalf of students seeking a college education and those who wish to serve in our country's uniform.;Turning around our troubled schools, putting the dream of a college education within the reach of working families, educating our kids--all of them--to graduate ready for college, ready for a career, ready to make the most of their lives, that's what we're doing. That is why we're here.;But while strengthening Hispanic education in America is the purpose of this initiative, it's not something that can fall on the Department of Education alone. I expect agencies across the Federal Government to take this initiative seriously and support its mission. And it's also not something the Government can do by itself. It's going to take all of us--public and private sectors, teachers and principals, all of you at home at those watch parties, parents getting involved in their kids' education and students giving their best--because the farther they go in school, the farther they will go in life, and that means the farther we'll go as a country.;Now I know there will be cynics out there who say that this improvement that we're seeking is not possible, that the reforms won't work, the problems in our education system are too entrenched. It's easy to think that way. This initiative, for example, has been around for 20 years, and we still face many of the same challenges. And it's true, as I've said ever since I ran for this office--and as everyone here knows firsthand--that change is hard. Change takes time. Fixing what is broken in our education system will not be easy. We won't see results overnight. It may take years, even decades, for all these changes to pay off.;But that's no reason not to get started. That's no reason not to strive for these changes. That's a reason for us, in fact, to start making them right now. It's a reason for us to follow through. And as long as I'm President, I will not give in to calls to shortchange any of our students.;So in the end, this is about building a brighter future where every child in this country--Black, White, Latino, Asian, or Native American, regardless of color, class, creed--has a chance to rise above any barrier to fulfill their God-given potential. It's about keeping the promise at the heart of this country that we love. The promise of a better life, the promise that our children will dream bigger, hope deeper, climb higher than we could ever imagine, that's the promise that so many of you work to advance each and every day in your own respective fields. And as long as I have the privilege of being your President, that's a promise that I intend to work to keep.;Thank you very much, everybody. Now I'm going to sign this initiative. Thank you.</td></tr>

In Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, pursuant to the authority provided in section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) (the "1988 Act"), the President modified the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the "Convention").;2. Presidential Proclamation 8039 of July 27, 2006, implemented the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 101(a) of the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USBFTA Implementation Act") (Public Law 109-169, 119 Stat. 3581) (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), incorporated in the HTS the schedule of duty reductions and rules of origin necessary or appropriate to carry out the USBFTA.;3. In order to ensure the continuation of the staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods from Bahrain in categories that were modified to conform to the Convention, the President proclaimed in Presidential Proclamation 8097 modifications to the HTS that he determined were necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8039.;4. Bahrain is a party to the Convention. Because the substance of changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing form in the national tariff schedules of the parties to the USBFTA, the rules of origin set out in Annexes 3-A and 4-A of that Agreement must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the USBFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under the tariff categories that were modified in Proclamation 8097. The USBFTA parties have agreed to make these changes in a protocol to the USBFTA, which will go into effect on November 1, 2010.;5. Section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act provides certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USBFTA. Section 202(j)(1)(A) of the USBFTA Implementation Act authorizes the President to proclaim the rules of origin set out in the USBFTA and any subordinate categories necessary to carry out the USBFTA, subject to certain exceptions set out in section 202(j)(2)(A).;6. I have determined that modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant to section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act and section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are necessary or appropriate to ensure the continuation of tariff and certain other treatment accorded originating goods under tariff categories modified in Proclamation 8097 and to carry out the duty reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8039.;7. Section 213A of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703a) (CBERA), as amended by the Haiti Economic Lift Program Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-171, 124 Stat. 1194) (19 U.S.C. 2701 note) (the "HELP Act"), provides that preferential tariff treatment may be provided for apparel and other articles originating in Haiti that are imported directly from Haiti or the Dominican Republic into the customs territory of the United States.;8. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided for under the CBERA, as amended, it is necessary to modify the HTS.;9. Proclamation 7987 of February 28, 2006, implemented the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). There was a technical error in the form of an inadvertent omission from Annex I of Publication 3829 of the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) entitled "Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement With Respect to El Salvador," which was incorporated by reference into Proclamation 7987.;10. I have determined that a technical correction to general note 29 to the HTS is necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the CAFTA-DR to originating goods.;11. In Proclamation 8097 two technical errors were made in U.S. note 2 to subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS as set forth in Annex I of Publication 3898 of the USITC entitled "Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Under Section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988," which was incorporated by reference into Proclamation 8097.;12. I have determined that technical corrections to U.S. note 2 to subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS are necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment.;13. Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified certain rules of origin of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Technical errors, including an inadvertent omission, were made in the modifications to general note 12 to the HTS as provided in Annex I of Publication 4095 of the USITC entitled "Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to Adjust Rules of Origin Under the North American Free Trade Agreement," which was incorporated by reference into Proclamation 8405.;14. I have determined that technical corrections to general note 12 to the HTS are necessary to provide the tariff and certain other treatment accorded under the NAFTA to originating goods.;15. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts, affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), provides that any modifications proclaimed by the President under section 1206(a) of that Act may not take effect before the thirtieth day after the date on which the text of the proclamation is published in the Federal Register.;Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, section 202 of the USBFTA Implementation Act, section 213A of CBERA, as amended, and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to reflect in the HTS the modifications to the rules of origin under the USBFTA once those modifications go into effect, general note 30 to the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this proclamation.;(2) In order to implement the tariff treatment provided for in section 213A of CBERA, as amended, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation.;(3) In order to make the technical corrections to general note 29 to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in paragraph 1 of Annex III to this proclamation.;(4) In order to make the technical corrections to U.S. note 2 to subchapter XVII of chapter 98 of the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in paragraph 2 of Annex III to this proclamation.;(5) In order to make technical corrections to general note 12 to the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in paragraph 3 of Annex III to this proclamation.;(6) The modifications and technical rectifications to the HTS set forth in Annex I to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the later of (i) November 1, 2010, or (ii) the thirtieth day after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.;(7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes II and III to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates provided in those Annexes.;(8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.;In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand ten, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-fifth.;BARACK OBAMA</td></tr>

Thank you so much. What an extraordinary crowd. Thank you. Please have a seat.;It is good to be back with NCLR. It is good to see all of you. Right off the bat, I should thank you because I have poached quite a few of your alumni to work in my administration. [ Laughter ] They're all doing outstanding work. Raul Yzaguirre, my Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Latinos serving at every level of my administration. We've got young people right out of college in the White House. We've got the first Latina Cabinet Secretary in history, Hilda Solis. So we couldn't be prouder of the work that so many folks who've been engaged with La Raza before, the handiwork that they're doing with our administration. And as Janet mentioned, obviously, we're extraordinarily proud of someone who is doing outstanding work on the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor.;Now, recently, 100 Latino officials from across the Government met with Latino leaders from across the country at the White House. I know some of you were there. And I think all who attended would agree that we weren't just paying lip service to the community. Our work together, not just that day but every day, has been more than just talk.;What I told the gathering at the White House was we need your voice. Your country needs you. Our American family will only be as strong as our growing Latino community. And so we're going to take these conversations on the road and keep working with you, because for more than four decades, NCLR has fought for opportunities for Latinos from city centers to farm fields. And that fight for opportunity—the opportunity to get a decent education, the opportunity to find a good job, the opportunity to make of our lives what we will—has never been more important than it is today.;And we're still climbing out of a vicious recession, and that recession hit Latino families especially hard. I don't need to tell you Latino unemployment is painfully high. And there's no doubt that this economy has not recovered as fast as it needs to. The truth is, it's going to take more time. And a lot of the problems we face right now, like slow job growth and stagnant wages, these were problems that were there even before the recession hit.;These challenges weren't caused overnight, they're not going to be solved overnight. But that only makes our work more urgent, to get this economy going and make sure that opportunity is spreading, to make sure that everyone who wants a job can find one, and to make sure that paychecks can actually cover the bills, to make sure that families don't have to choose between buying groceries or buying medicine, that they don't have to choose between sending their kids to college or being able to retire.;My number-one priority, every single day, is to figure out how we can get businesses to hire and create jobs with decent wages. And in the short term, there are some things we can do right away. I want to extend tax relief that we already put in place for middle class families to make sure that folks have more money in their paychecks. And I want to cut redtape that keeps entrepreneurs from turning new ideas into thriving businesses. I want to sign trade deals so our businesses can sell more goods made in America to the rest of the world, especially to the Americas.;And the hundreds of thousands of construction workers—many of them Latino—who lost their jobs when the housing bubble burst, I want to put them back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges and new schools and airports all across the country. There is work to be done. These workers are ready to do it.;So bipartisan proposals for all of these jobs measures would already be law if Congress would just send them to my desk, and I'd appreciate if you all would help me convince them to do it. We need to get it done. [ Applause ] We need to get it done.;Now, obviously, the other debate in Washington that we're having is one that's going to have a direct impact on every American. Every day, NCLR and your affiliates hear from families figuring out how to stretch every dollar a little bit further, what sacrifices they've got to make, how they're going to budget only what's truly important. So they should expect the same thing from Washington. Neither party is blameless for the decisions that led to our debt, but both parties have a responsibility to come together and solve the problem and make sure that the American people aren't hurt on this issue.;Because—I just want to talk about this for a second, because it has a potential impact on everybody here and all the communities you serve—if we don't address the debt that's already on our national credit card, it will leave us unable to invest in things like education, to protect vital programs.;So I've already said I'm willing to cut spending that we don't need by historic amounts to reduce our long-term deficit and make sure that we can invest in our children's future. I'm willing to take on the rising costs of health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid to make sure they're strong and secure for future generations.;But we can't just close our deficits by cutting spending. That's the truth, and Americans understand that. Because if all we all do is cut, then seniors will have to pay a lot more for their health care, and students will have to pay a lot more for college, and workers who get laid off might not have any temporary assistance or job training to get them back on their feet. And with gas prices this high, we'd have to stop much of the clean energy research that will help us free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil.;Not only is it not fair if all of this is done on the backs of middle class families and poor families, it doesn't make sense. It may sound good to save a lot of money over the next 5 years, but not if we sacrifice our future for the next 50.;And that's why people from both parties have said that the best way to take on our deficit is with a balanced approach, one where the wealthiest Americans and big corporations pay their fair share too. Before we stop funding energy research, we should ask oil companies and corporate jet owners to give up special tax breaks that other folks don't get. Before we ask college students to pay more to go to college, we should ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes that are lower in their—in terms of rates than their secretaries. Before we ask seniors to pay more for Medicare, before we ask seniors to pay more for Medicare we should ask people like me to give up tax breaks that we don't need and weren't even asking for.;So, NCLR, that's at the heart of this debate. Are we a nation that asks only the middle class and the poor to bear the burden? After they've seen their jobs disappear and their incomes decline over a decade? Are we a people who break the promises we've made to seniors or the disabled and leave them to fend for themselves?;That's not who we are. We are better than that. We're a people who look out for one another. We're a people who believe in shared sacrifice, because we know that we rise or fall as one nation. We're a people who will do whatever it takes to make sure our children have the same chances and the same opportunities that our parents gave us—not just the same chances, better chances, than our parents gave us. That's the American way.;And that's what NCLR is all about. That's what the Latino community is all about. When I spoke to you as a candidate for this office, I said you and I share a belief that opportunity and prosperity aren't just words to be said, they are promises to be kept. Back then, we didn't know the depths of the challenges that were going to lie ahead. But thanks to you, we are keeping our promises.;We're keeping our promise to make sure that America remains a place where opportunity is open to all who work for it. We've cut taxes for middle class workers and small businesses and low-income families. We won credit card reform and financial reform and protections for consumers and folks who use payday lenders or send remittances home from being exploited and being ripped off.;We worked to secure health care for 4 million children, including the children of legal immigrants. And we are implementing health reform for all who've been abused by insurance companies and all who fear about going broke if they get sick. And these were huge victories for the Latino community that suffers from lack of health insurance more than any other group.;We're keeping our promise to give our young people every opportunity to succeed. NCLR has always organized its work around the principle that the single most important investment we can make is in our children's education and that if we let our Latino students fall behind, we will all fall behind. I believe that.;So we've tied giving more money to reform. And we're working with States to improve teacher recruitment and retraining and retention. We're making sure English language learners are a priority for educators across the country. We're holding schools with high dropout rates accountable so they start delivering for our kids. We're emphasizing math and science and investing in community colleges so that all of our workers get the skills that today's companies want. And we've won new college grants for more than 100,000 Latino students. And as long as I am President, this country will always invest in its young people.;These are victories for NCLR, they are victories for America. And we did it with your help. We're keeping our promises.;Of course, that doesn't mean we don't have unfinished business. I promised you I would work tirelessly to fix our broken immigration system and make the "DREAM Act" a reality. And 2 months ago, I went down to the border of El Paso to reiterate—[ applause ]. El Paso is in the house—[ laughter ]—to reiterate my vision for an immigration system that holds true to our values and our heritage and meets our economic and security needs. And I argued this wasn't just the moral thing to do, it was an economic imperative.;In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America—companies like Google and Intel—were founded on immigrants. One in six new small-business owners are immigrants. These are job creators who came here to seek opportunity and now seek to share opportunity.;This country has always been made stronger by our immigrants. That's what makes America special. We attract talented, dynamic, optimistic people who are continually refreshing our economy and our spirit. And you can see that in urban areas all across the country where communities that may have been hollowed out when manufacturing left or were having problems because of an aging population, suddenly, you see an influx of immigration, and you see streets that were full of boarded-up buildings, suddenly, they're vibrant with life once again. And it's immigrant populations who are providing that energy and that drive.;We have a system right now that allows the best and the brightest to come study in America and then tells them to leave, set up the next great company someplace else. We have a system that tolerates immigrants and businesses that breaks the rules and punishes those that follow the rules. We have a system that separates families, and punishes innocent young people for their parents' actions by denying them the chance to earn an education or contribute to our economy or serve in our military. These are the laws on the books.;Now, I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books, but that doesn't mean I don't know very well the real pain and heartbreak that deportations cause. I share your concerns, and I understand them. And I promise you, we are responding to your concerns and working every day to make sure we are enforcing flawed laws in the most humane and best possible way.;Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. Believe me—[ applause ]—and believe me, right now dealing with Congress, the idea——;Audience members. Yes you can! Yes you can! Yes you can!;The President. But believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. [ Laughter ] I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. [ Laughter ] But that's not how our system works.;Audience member. Change it!;The President. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.;So let's be honest. I need a dance partner here, and the floor is empty. [ Laughter ];Five years ago, 23 Republican Senators supported comprehensive immigration reform because they knew it was the right thing to do for the economy and it was the right thing to do for America. Today, they've walked away. Republicans helped write the "DREAM Act" because they knew it was the right thing to do for the country. Today, they've walked away. Last year, we passed the "DREAM Act" through the House only to see it blocked by Senate Republicans. It was heartbreaking to get so close and see politics get in the way, particularly because some of the folks who walked away had previously been sponsors of this.;Now, all that has to change. And part of the problem is, is that the political winds have changed. That's left States to come up with patchwork versions of reform that don't solve the problem. You and I know that's not the right way to go. We can't have 50 immigration laws across the country.;So yes, feel free to keep the heat on me and keep the heat on Democrats. But here's the only thing you should know. The Democrats and your President are with you—[ applause ]—are with you. Don't get confused about that. Remember who it is that we need to move in order to actually change the laws.;Now, usually, as soon as I come out in favor of something, about half of Congress is immediately against it even if it was originally their idea. [ Laughter ] You notice how that works? [ Laughter ] So I need you to keep building a movement for change outside of Washington, one they can't stop, one that's greater than this community.;We need a movement that bridges party lines, that unites business and labor and faith communities and law enforcement communities and all who know that America cannot continue operating with a broken immigration system. And I will be there every step of the way. I will keep up this fight, because Washington is way behind where the rest of the country knows we need to go.;And I know that can be frustrating. This is a city where compromise is becoming a dirty word, where there's more political upside in doing what's easier for reelection, what's easier for an attack ad, than what's best for the country. But, NCLR, I want you to know, when you feel frustration or you're feeling cynical, and when you hear people say we can't solve our problems or we can't bring about the change that we've fought so hard for, I do want you to remember everything that we've already accomplished together just in 2½ years. And I want you to remember why we do this in the first place.;Recently, I heard the story of a participant at this gathering that we had at the White House that I was telling you about at the top of my speech. So this participant's name was Marie Lopez Rogers. And Marie was born to migrant farm workers in Avondale, Arizona. As a young girl, she and her brother would help their parents in the cotton fields. And I'm assuming the temperatures were sort of like they've been the last couple days here in DC. And it was in those cotton fields that Marie's father would tell her, "If you don't want to be working in this heat, you better stay in school." And so that's what Marie did.;And because of that, because of the tireless, back-breaking work of her parents, because of their willingness to struggle and sacrifice so that one day their children wouldn't have to, Marie became the first in her family to go to college. And interestingly, she now works at the very site where she used to pick cotton, except now city hall sits there, and Marie is the town's mayor.;So that's the promise of America. That is why we love this country so much. That is why all of us are here. That's why I am here. Some of us had parents or grandparents who said, maybe I can't go to college, but someday my child will go to college. Maybe I can't start my own business, but I promise you someday my child will start his or her own business. I may have to rent today, but someday my child will have a home of her own. My back may be tired, my hands may be cut, I may be working a field, but someday, someday my daughter will be mayor or Secretary of Labor or a Supreme Court Justice.;Hermanos y hermanas, that promise is in our hands. It's up to us to continue that story. It's up to us to hand it down to all of our children: Latino, Black, White, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled, not disabled. We're one family, and we need each other. And if we remember that and continue to focus on that, if we come together and work together as one people and summon the best in each other, I'm confident that promise will endure.;Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.</td></tr>

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e)(2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), one of the reasons that major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced despite the concerned government's most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures.;Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to make substantial efforts to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA. Accompanying this report are justifications for the determinations on Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela, as required by section 706(2)(B).;I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid Bolivia and Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.;Afghanistan remains the world's largest producer of opium poppy and a major source of heroin. Primary trafficking routes from Afghanistan, where poppy cultivation is still mostly confined to the southern and western provinces, are through Iran to Turkey and Western Europe, through Pakistan to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and through Central Asia to the Russian Federation.;Helmand Province remains the largest grower of opium poppy in Afghanistan, but the Provincial Government's innovative Food Zone program, which provides farmers with wheat seed and fertilizer in exchange for a pledge not to grow poppy, coupled with credible law enforcement, has reduced Helmand's poppy cultivation by a third, to 69,883 hectares in 2009 and even further to 65,043 hectares in 2010. The U.S.-funded Governor Led Eradication (GLE) program has demonstrated progress in Helmand with 2,111 hectares eradicated by the end of May 2011. To date during 2011, a total of 3,827 hectares of GLE has been verified in 17 provinces throughout the country, an increase of more than 45 percent in eradication over the same time last year.;Although the amount of opium poppy cultivated in Pakistan is much less than Afghanistan, the country continues to qualify as a major drug producing country, with an estimated 1,700 hectares of opium poppy under cultivation. The country also remains a major transit country for opiates and hashish for markets around the world and is a transit country for precursor chemicals illegally smuggled to Afghanistan, where they are used to process heroin. Bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and the United States continues to support Pakistan's goal of returning to poppy-free status. United States Government support focuses especially on upgrading the institutional capacity of Pakistan's law enforcement agencies.;A number of indicators qualify the addition of El Salvador and Belize to the Majors List along with the remainder of Central American countries on the isthmus connecting South America to North America.;El Salvador, located between Guatemala and Nicaragua along the Pacific coastline and sharing an eastern border with Honduras, is subject to a number of factors making it vulnerable to the drug trade flowing to the United States from South America. The International Narcotics Control Board describes El Salvador as part of the so-called "northern triangle" with Guatemala and Honduras where "national gangs are forming alliances with international criminal syndicates." According to the most recent U.S. interagency assessment of cocaine flows, the amount of this illicit substance passing through El Salvador destined directly for the United States was estimated at 4 metric tons in 2009.;The most recent U.S. assessment for Belize estimates the flow of drugs destined for the United States through this Central American country on the Caribbean coast at about 10 metric tons. Belize's vulnerability as a south-north avenue for the illegal narcotics trade is also demonstrated by recent drug and weapons seizures in Mexico along the border it shares with Belize. United States officials also report that drug control observers in Belize are increasingly concerned about the presence of drug trafficking organizations, including Los Zetas of Mexico, in the country's border areas and in coastal ports.;Considering the Central American region as a whole, the United States Government estimates that as much as 90 percent of some 700 metric tons of cocaine shipped annually from Colombia and other producing nations intended for the U.S. markets passes through the countries of Central America. This situation is an important element prompting the Central American Citizen Security Partnership, which I announced in March 2011. Through this partnership, the United States is working to refocus the impact of assistance through the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) and enhance the impact of complementary United States Government non-CARSI citizen safety and rule of law programs. Countries in the region are increasing coordination through the Central American Integration System, a combined effort to promote citizen security and economic prosperity, including programs aimed at thwarting the drug trade.;International documentation shows continued strengthening of illegal drug trafficking ties between South America and West Africa. West Africa is the closest point to South America for transatlantic purposes, and its close proximity to southern Europe provides a natural gateway to European drug markets. Porous borders, inadequate law enforcement, and corruption create a permissive environment for the illegal drug trade. West African linguistic connections among Brazil, Portugal, and Cape Verde may also contribute to narcotics trafficking. According to the U.S. assessment of cocaine movement, about a third of cocaine destined for Europe passed through West Africa in 2009. The 2011 U.N. World Drug Report also states there are reports that cocaine from Latin America is being stockpiled in some West African countries for future distribution to Europe in smaller quantities.;Despite the range of domestic challenges, including corruption, West African countries have begun to consider narcotics control as a top national security priority. For example, in 2010, Liberian law enforcement successfully uncovered and interdicted a cache of cocaine valued at $100 million. A number of U.S. projects in West Africa are aimed at improving drug interdiction and investigation capabilities. The assistance provided by international donors and organizations to West African governments to improve their counternarcotics capability is increasingly urgent. The United States welcomes fresh impetus in 2010 and 2011 from the international community, especially the United Nations and the European Union, to make Africa a priority for drug-control assistance, to promote and protect the stability and positive growth of countries in Africa.;The stealth with which both marijuana and synthetic drugs such as MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine are produced in Canada and trafficked to the United States makes it difficult to measure the overall impact of this smuggling. However, a special report prepared in May 2011 by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration states that "the threat posed by MDMA trafficking from Canada to and within the United States is significant." For example, in April 2011, a seizure of 20 pounds of MDMA from a Canada-based trafficking group was made by U.S. law enforcement in Plattsburg, New York. The United States pledges a more robust engagement and dialogue with Canada to reduce the shared problem of illegal drug trafficking. The results of this bilateral redoubling of drug-control cooperation will be considered in the framework of next year's Presidential Determination.;You are hereby authorized and directed to submit this determination under section 706 of the FRAA, transmit it to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.;BARACK OBAMA</td></tr>

Section 1205(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the "1988 Act") (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)) directs the United States International Trade Commission (the "Commission") to keep the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) under continuous review and periodically to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commission considers necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes set forth in that subsection. The Commission has recommended modifications to the HTS pursuant to sections 1205(c) and (d) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)) to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (the "Convention").;2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President to proclaim modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission under section 1205 of the 1988 Act, if he determines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed in this proclamation pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act are in conformity with United States obligations under the Convention and do not run counter to the national economic interest of the United States.;3. Presidential Proclamation 6763 of December 23, 1994, implemented with respect to the United States, the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, including Schedule XX-United States of America, annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Schedule XX), that were entered into pursuant to sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 2902(a) and (e)), and approved in section 101(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)).;4. Pursuant to the authority provided in section 111 of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521) and sections 1102(a) and (e) of the 1988 Act, Proclamation 6763 included the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of Schedule XX. In order to ensure the continuation of such rates of duty for imported goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed, including certain technical or conforming changes within the tariff schedule.;5. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (the "USSFTA Act") (19 U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in rates of duty that the President determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out or apply articles 2.2, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.12 of the USSFTA and the schedule of reductions with respect to the Republic of Singapore set forth in Annex 2B of the USSFTA. In order to ensure the continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods under tariff categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Convention, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.;6.
