Among the considerations listed in sections 501 and 502(c) is the level of economic development of a beneficiary as indicated by per capita GNP, the general living standard of its inhabitants and other economic factors that the President deems appropriate. Section 504(c)(6)(B)(ii) of the Act requires that the President notify the Congress of his intent to designate a beneficiary country as a least-developed beneficiary country at least 60 days before such determination becomes final.;I have determined that the 32 countries listed above qualify as least-developed nations. The list includes all those countries now eligible for GSP under the U.S. program and recognized by the United Nations as least-developed countries.;In order to insure that Congress has a full 60-day period in which to review this decision prior to its implementation, the designation with respect to the 32 GSP beneficiary countries will not become effective until the statutory deadline of July 4, 1985, contained in section 504(c)(6)(B)(ii) of the Act.;Sincerely;RONALD REAGAN</td></tr>

Bush: Remarks Prior to Discussions With Central African Leaders and an Exchange With Reporters in New York City</td><td class="c6">September 13, 2002</td><td class="c7">The President. Thank you all for coming. First, I'm honored to be able to meet with my colleagues from Central Africa. The Secretary of State and I look forward to a very frank and constructive dialog about how to continue our common pursuit against terror and how we will work together to promote prosperity. I look forward to a constructive dialog. So thank you all for coming.;Before we begin our discussion, let me answer a few questions. Are the interpreters working right now? They are? Yours isn't working, okay. Before we begin our dialog, I'm going to take three questions from the American press corps, starting with Mr. Fournier [Ron Fournier], who writes for the Associated Press.;President Saddam Hussein of Iraq;Q. Thank you, sir. Knowing what you know about Saddam, what are the odds that he's going to meet all your demands and avoid confrontation?;The President. I am highly doubtful that he'll meet our demands. I hope he does, but I'm highly doubtful. The reason I'm doubtful is, he's had 11 years to meet the demands. For 11 long years he has basically told the United Nations and the world he doesn't care. And so, therefore, I am doubtful but, nevertheless, made the decision to move forward to work with the world community. And I hope the world community knows that we're extremely serious about what I said yesterday and we expect a quick resolution to the issue. And that's starting with quick action on a resolution.;Randy [Randy Mikkelsen, Reuters].;United Nations Resolution;Q. Yes, sir, how soon are you expecting the resolution from the United Nations? In a week, month, days?;The President. As soon as possible.;Q. And how—what kind of deadline would you perceive within that resolution?;The President. Well, there will be deadlines within the resolution. Our chief negotiator for the United States, our Secretary of State, understands that we must have deadlines. And we're talking days and weeks, not months and years. And that's essential for the security of the world. This man has had 11 years to comply. For 11 long years, he's ignored world opinion, and he's put the credibility of the United Nations on line.;As I said yesterday, we'll determine— how we deal with this problem will help determine the fate of a multilateral body, which has been unilaterally ignored by Saddam Hussein. Will this body be able to keep the peace and deal with the true threats, including threats to security in Central Africa and other parts of the world, or will it be irrelevant?;Judy Keen [USA Today].;Timing of Congressional Action/President Vladimir Putin of Russia;Q. Mr. President, thank you. Are you concerned that Democrats in Congress still don't want a vote there until after U.N. action? And secondly, have you spoken with President Putin since your speech yesterday?;The President. I have not spoken to President Putin since my speech. I did speak to his Foreign Minister, as did Colin Powell. I'll speak to President Putin, I'm confident, soon. I'll have—I think we've got a scheduled phone call, actually.;And the first part of the question was, Democrats waiting for the U.N. to act? I can't imagine an elected United States— elected Member of the United States Senate or House of Representatives saying, "I think I'm going to wait for the United Nations to make a decision." It seems like to me that if you're representing the United States, you ought to be making a decision on what's best for the United States. If I were running for office, I'm not sure how I'd explain to the American people—say, "Vote for me, and, oh, by the way, on a matter of national security, I think I'm going to wait for somebody else to act.;And so I—we'll see. My answer to the Congress is, they need to debate this issue and consult with us and get the issue done as quickly as possible. It's in our national interests that we do so. I don't imagine Saddam Hussein sitting around, saying, "Gosh, I think I'm going to wait for some resolution or not." He's a threat, and we must deal with it as quickly as possible.;Thank you all.</td></tr>

We will continue to show the leadership required to achieve these goals as the cornerstone of human freedom and dignity.;We will strengthen the capacity of the Economic Community for Central African States (CEEAC) and the Monetary and Economic Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) sub-regional organizations, and work with the Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX) to prevent and resolve conflict, reduce human suffering, and promote regional economic integration.;Convinced that peace and security are global, we support the call by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Bush for Iraq to fulfill its obligations toward the United Nations. We agree that the UN Security Council must face its responsibilities and demonstrate the resolve to enforce its resolutions.;We further agreed that cooperation is essential to combat terrorism, and affirmed our commitment to build regional and national capabilities to share information and implement United Nations Security Council resolutions to eliminate and deny sanctuary for terrorist organizations, networks, and finance across Central Africa.</td></tr>

Sections 501(1) and (4) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2461(1) and (4)), provide that, in affording duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the President shall have due regard for, among other factors, the effect such action will have on furthering the economic development of a beneficiary developing country and the extent of the beneficiary developing country's competitiveness with respect to eligible articles. Section 502(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)(2)) provides that, in determining whether to designate any country as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the President shall take into account various factors, including the country's level of economic development, the country's per capita gross national product, the living standards of its inhabitants, and any other economic factors he deems appropriate. Section 502(d) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)) authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any country after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act.

In Proclamation 8334, the President modified the HTS to provide duty-free access into the United States through December 31, 2009, for specified quantities of certain agricultural products of Israel. In Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, I further modified the HTS to provide the intended tariff treatment.;17. On December 6, 2009, the United States entered into a further agreement with Israel to extend the period that the 2004 Agreement is in force through December 31, 2010, to allow for further negotiations on an agreement to replace the 2004 Agreement.;18.

Section 202 of the NAFTA Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 3332) provides rules for determining whether goods imported into the United States originate in the territory of a NAFTA party and thus are eligible for the tariff and other treatment contemplated under the NAFTA.;21. Presidential Proclamation 8405 of August 31, 2009, modified the HTS to provide for modifications to the rules of origin under the NAFTA. I have determined that technical corrections to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin.;22. Presidential Proclamation 7747 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USSFTA. I have determined that certain rules of origin under the USSFTA were inadvertently deleted in the HTS and that technical rectifications to the HTS are necessary to restore the intended rules of origin.;23. Presidential Proclamation 7746 of December 30, 2003, implemented the United States-Chile Free Trade Agreement (USCFTA) with respect to the United States, including certain rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes of implementing tariff treatment under the USCFTA.

They contained certain modifications that affected the rules of origin under the Andean Trade Preference Act. Modifications to the HTS are necessary to conform the rules of origin for certain yarns described in section 204(b)(3)(B)(vi)(IV) of the Andean Trade Preference Act to the Convention. I have determined that additional conforming changes to the HTS are necessary to provide for the intended rules of origin under the CAFTA-DR.;26. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.;Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act and section 4 of the USIFTA Act, do proclaim that;(1) The designation of Croatia as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2011.;(2) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) of the HTS is modified by deleting "Croatia" from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.;(3) The designation of Equatorial Guinea as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP is terminated, effective on January 1, 2011.;(4) In order to reflect this termination in the HTS, general note 4(a) of the HTS is modified by deleting " Equatorial Guinea " from the list of independent countries, effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 2011.
