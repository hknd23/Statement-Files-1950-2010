MID 128602, US v Bulgaria, 15 feb to 17-Mar-51 to 24-Nov-51

130 - Toasts of the President and the President of Ecuador.
June 20, 1951

I fear very much that that is not the case with Romania or Bulgaria or Hungary or Czechoslovakia or Poland. The free countries of Western Europe do not feel towards their powerful neighbor as our neighbors feel towards us--and that is one of the happiest things in the history of the world



174 - Address in Detroit at the Celebration of the City's 250th Anniversary.
July 28, 1951

We know that Bulgaria, Rumania, and Hungary now have armed forces far greater than those allowed under the peace treaties they signed in 1947. That is one of our difficulties in dealing with Soviets of any kind, they have no respect for signed treaties or their given word. 
We know also that Rumania recently ordered the inhabitants moved out of a stretch of land 30 miles wide, along the Yugoslav border. Bulgaria and Hungary have done the same thing. Military preparations have been going on in those zones along the border. Actions like these are certainly no indication of peaceful intentions



253 - Remarks to a Delegation From the American Hungarian Federation.
October 12, 1951

Our only effort in the world is for world peace. We want all the peoples of the world to enjoy the same individual liberties which we enjoy. We had hoped, after our conversations at Yalta and Potsdam, that that would be the case with Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, but it is not, I am sorry to say
