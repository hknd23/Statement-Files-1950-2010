Kennedy: Special Message to the Congress on Foreign Aid</td><td class="c6">March 13, 1962</td><td class="c7">To the Congress of the United States;Last year this nation dedicated itself to a "Decade of Development," designed to help the new and developing states of the world grow in political independence, economic welfare and social justice.;Last September, in support of this effort, the Congress enacted fundamental changes in our program of foreign assistance.;Last November the Executive Branch drastically reorganized and re-staffed this program in accordance with the Congressional mandate.;Today the "decade" is only four months old. It would surely be premature to make any claims of dramatic results. Our new aid program, addressed to the specific needs of individual countries for long-term development, presupposes basic changes, careful planning and gradual achievement. Yet these few months have shown significant movement in new directions. The "turnaround" has begun.;Our new aid policy aims at strengthening the political and economic independence of developing countries--which means strengthening their capacity both to master the inherent stress of rapid change and to repel Communist efforts to exploit such stress from within or without. In the framework of this broad policy, economic, social and military development take their proper place. In Washington our aid operations have been largely unified under the direction of the Administrator of the Agency for International Development. Recipient countries are improving their planning mechanisms, devising country development plans, and beginning extensive programs of self-help and self-reform. In addition to long range programs developed with India, Nigeria and others we have, under the new authority granted by the Congress, entered into a new type of long-term commitment with two nations--Pakistan and Tanganyika --after the most painstaking review of their proposed development plans, and others will follow. In addition to placing emphasis on the improvement of internal security forces, we are giving increased attention to the contribution which local military forces can make through civic action programs to economic and social development.;In financing these programs, we are relying more heavily than before on loans repayable in dollars. Other institutions are joining with us in this effort--not only private institutions but also the United Nations, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Organization of American States and the Inter-American Development Bank. We have urged other industrialized countries to devote a larger share of their resources to the provision of capital to the less developed nations. Some have done so--and we are hopeful that the rest will also recognize their stake in the success and stability of the emerging economies. We are continuing, in view of our balance of payments situation, to emphasize procurement within the United States for most goods required by the program. And we are working toward strengthening the foreign exchange position of the emerging countries by encouraging the development of new trade patterns. The proposed new Trade Expansion Act is a most important tool in facilitating this trend.;Much more, of course, could be said. But having set forth last year in a series of messages and addresses on foreign aid the goals we seek and the tools we need, it is not necessary to repeat to the Congress this year our nation's basic interest in the development and freedom of other nations--or to review all of the initiatives launched under last year's programs. The Congress is familiar with these arguments and programs, as well as its own role and contribution in enacting long-term financing authority. Thus the foreign aid legislation submitted this year does not require reconsideration of these questions. It is instead limited primarily to the new authorizations required annually under the terms of last year's law. The only major change proposed is the establishment of a separate long-term Alliance for Progress fund. The total amounts requested were included in the federal Budget previously submitted for fiscal 1963 and the authorizing legislation enacted last year, and have in fact been reduced in some instances. They cannot, I believe, be further reduced if the partnership on which we are now embarked--a joint endeavor with each developing nation and with each aid-giving nation--is to demonstrate the advances in human well-being which flow from economic development joined with political liberty. For we should know by now that where weakness and dependence are not transformed into strength and self-reliance, we can expect only chaos, and then tyranny, to follow.;II.;Because Development Lending and Military Assistance appropriations for fiscal Year 1963 were authorized in the foreign Assistance Act of 1961, no new authorizations for these two programs are needed. I am proposing new authorization and appropriation of $335 million for Development Grants, $485.5 million for Supporting Assistance, $148.9 million for contributions to International Organizations, $100 million for Investment Guarantees, $400 million for the Contingency fund, and $60 million for administrative costs and other programs. I am also proposing appropriations for 1963 of $2,753 million, including the $1,250 million already authorized for development lending, and $1,500 million ($200 million below that authorized) for military assistance. The total appropriation request for the foreign economic and military assistance program for fiscal year 1963 is $4,878 million.;These recommendations are based upon a careful examination of the most urgent needs of each country and area. Each of these forms of assistance, in these amounts, is essential to the achievement of our overall foreign assistance objectives. The total is less than the estimates in the Budget because of a reduction in my request for Supporting Assistance.;One item in particular deserves attention. The past year has amply demonstrated that rapid and unpredictable changes in the world situation of direct interest to our security cannot be foreseen or predicted accurately at the time Congress acts upon the appropriations. I therefore urge the Congress to recognize this need for flexibility to meet contingencies and emergencies and to approve the full authorization and appropriation requested of $400 million.;III.;The Charter of Punta del Este which last August established the Alliance for Progress is the framework of goals and conditions for what has been called "a peaceful revolution on a Hemispheric scale.;That revolution had begun before the Charter was drawn. It will continue after its goals are reached. If its goals are not achieved, the revolution will continue but its methods and results will be tragically different. History has removed for governments the margin of safety between the peaceful revolution and the violent revolution. The luxury of a leisurely interval is no longer available.;These were the facts recognized at Punta del Este. These were the facts that dictated the terms of the Charter. And these are the facts which require our participation in this massive cooperative effort.;To give this program the special recognition and additional resources which it requires, I therefore propose an authorization of $3 billion for the Alliance for Progress for the next four years. Of the $3 billion, an authorization and appropriation of $600 million is being requested for 1963, with up to $100 million to be used for grants and the balance of $500 million or more for development loans. This authorization will be separate from and supplementary to the $6 billion already authorized for loans for development for 1963 through 1966, which will remain available for use throughout the world.;During the year beginning last March over $1.0 billion has been committed in Latin America by the United States in support of the Alliance, fulfilling the pledge we made at the first Punta del Este meeting, and launching in a very real way for this Hemisphere a dramatic Decade of Development. But even with this impressive support, the destiny of the Alliance lies largely in the hands of the countries themselves. For even large amounts of external aid can do no more than provide the margin which enables each country through its own determination and action to achieve lasting success.;The United States recognizes that it takes time--to develop careful programs for national development and the administrative capacity necessary to carry out such a program--to go beyond the enactment of land reform measures and actually transfer the land and make the most productive use of it--to pass new tax laws and then achieve their acceptance and enforcement. It is heartening, therefore, that the changes called for by the Alliance for Progress have been the central issue in several Latin American elections--demonstrating that its effects will be deep and real. Under the Organization of American States, nine outstanding economists and development advisors have begun to assist countries in critically reviewing their plans. Three Latin American countries have already completed and submitted for review their plans for the more effective mobilization of their resources toward national development. The others are creating and strengthening their mechanisms for development planning. A number of Latin American countries have already taken significant steps toward land or tax reform, and throughout the region there is a new ferment of activity, centered on improvements in education, in rural development, in.public administration, and on other essential institutional measures required to give a sound basis for economic growth.;But more important still is the changed attitudes of peoples and governments already noticeable in Latin America. The Alliance has fired the imagination and kindled the hopes of millions of our good neighbors. Their drive toward modernization is gaining momentum as it unleashes the energies of these millions, and the United States is becoming increasingly identified in the minds of the people with the goal they move toward: a better life with freedom. Our hand--extended in help--is being accepted without loss of dignity.;But the Alliance is barely under way. It is a task for a decade, not for a year. It requires further changes in outlook and policy by all American States. New institutions will need to be formed. New plans-if they are to be serious--will have to assume a life other than on paper.;One of the brightest pages of the world's history has been the series of programs this Nation has devised, established and implemented following the Second World War to help free peoples achieve economic development and the control of their own destinies. These programs, which have been solidly based on bipartisan support, are the proud manifestations of our deep-seated love and pursuit of freedom for individuals and for nations.;I realize that there are among us those who are weary of sustaining this continual effort to help other nations. But I would ask them to look at a map and recognize that many of those whom we help live on the "front-lines" of the long twilight struggle for freedom--that others are new nations posed between order and chaos--and the rest are older nations now undergoing a turbulent transition of new expectations. Our efforts to help them help themselves, to demonstrate and to strengthen the vitality of free institutions, are small in cost compared to our military outlays for the defense of freedom. Yet all of our armies and atoms combined will be of little avail if these nations fall, unable to meet the needs of their own people, and unable to stave off within their borders the rise of forces that threaten our security. This program--and the passage of this bill--are vital to the interests of the United States.;We are, I am confident, equal to our responsibilities in this area--responsibilities as compelling as any our nation has known. Today, we are still in the first months of a decade's sustained effort. But I can report that our efforts are underway, they are moving in the right direction, they are gaining momentum daily, and they have already begun to realize a small part of their great potential. The turn-around has indeed begun.;JOHN F. KENNEDY</td></tr>

Kennedy: Remarks at a Meeting With the Headquarters Staff of the Peace Corps.</td><td class="c6">June 14, 1962</td><td class="c7">Sarge, Governor, Fowler;I never thought I would get such a warm hand at the Chamber of Commerce, and I don't think I ever will again.;I wanted to come over here this morning to express my very great appreciation to you for all that you have done to make the Peace Corps such an important part of the life of America and, though I hate to use this word which we have inherited from other days, the image of America overseas.;I don't think it is altogether fair to say that I handed Sarge a lemon from which he made lemonade, but I do think that he was handed and you were handed one of the most sensitive and difficult assignments which any administrative group in Washington has been given, almost, in this century.;The concept of the Peace Corps was entirely new. It was subjected to a great deal of criticism at the beginning. If it had not been done with such great care and really, in a sense, loving and prideful care, it could have defeated a great purpose and could have set back the whole cause of public service internationally for a good many years. That it has turned out to be the success that it has been has been due to the tireless work of Sargent Shriver, and to all of you. You have brought to Government service a sense of morale and a sense of enthusiasm and, really, commitment which has been absent from too many governmental agencies for too many years.;So that while the Peace Corpsmen overseas have rendered unusual service, those of you who have worked to make this a success here in Washington I think have set an example for Government service which I hope will be infectious. Government service should be, in these days when so much depends upon the United States, the most prideful of all careers. To serve in the United States Government, to be a public employee, to be a bureaucrat in the critical sense--that should be the greatest source of satisfaction to any American.;I hope that when the times are written and when we have moved on to other work inevitably the sense of having worked for the Government during important days will be the greatest source of pride to all of us.;You remember, in the Second World War, Winston Churchill made one of his speeches--I think at Tripoli, when the 8th Army marched in there--and said, "they will say to you 'What did you do during the great war?' and you will be able to say I marched with the 8th Army!'" Well, they may ask you what you have done in the sixties for your country, and you will be able to say, "I served in the Peace Corps, I served in the United States Government," and I think that people will recognize that you have made your contribution.;There have been three Peace Corpsmen who have died already in the service of their country and in a larger sense in the service of peace and the service of all people, one in the Philippines, and two in Colombia. And I suppose through the hazards of fate, living as these young men and women do, and not all of them are young, on the horizon of experience that others will find themselves giving up their lives.;I can imagine if that must come, no cause--cause of peace--is more worthy of that kind of a great contribution. To be able to make a maximum effort to serve peace in a time of maximum danger, I would consider the most satisfactory of human experiences.;I am particularly pleased that the first enthusiasm for the Peace Corps has not given way to a sense of disillusionment. The fact is that we are getting more and better recruits than ever before. The standards have been maintained and at an increasingly higher pitch. This has not become a routine assignment as so many other experiences become. I hope this sense of participation in a new and important cause will be maintained over the years.;So I want you all to know that you--most of you are young in the service of the Government-that you have set a very high standard for the Government, that even those who have worked in other agencies for years, who have come here, have found themselves caught up in this tide, and therefore all of us are indebted to you. I hope that this spirit is maintained, and I hope all of you realize that this country, and countries far beyond, are most indebted to you, and that you are playing a part in an activity. and an adventure that goes far beyond the shores of the United States. We appreciate all that you are doing.;[At this point, Mr. Shriver stated that the President had indicated that he would answer questions from those who would like to ask them. He pointed out that the President had said that the questions did not have to deal with the Peace Corps exclusively, but could be on any subject including any aspect of foreign policy.];[1.] Q. I wonder if the President may discuss briefly the relationship between the Peace Corps and present U.S. Foreign policy.;THE PRESIDENT. Well, to speak about only one area, I think that the United States, because the defense of the free world rests in the main upon the United States, the military defense, the emphasis has been continually, of course, upon alliances and upon the military strength of our country and our willingness to sustain our words with our deeds.;In addition, this inevitable requirement is subjected to continual attack by those who are opposed to us as a matter of propaganda, and as a matter of attack-that the United States is essentially militaristic, that the emphasis that has been placed upon the use of atomic weapons, all of this has presented the United States in many key parts of the world as a rather harsh, narrow-minded militaristic, materialistic society.;This, of course, has its adverse effects, particularly upon intellectuals, students, and others who have a--hold a power in a sense disproportionate to their numbers, if not their importance, but certainly far greater than their opposite numbers do in the United States. They are key groups who are the object of a concentrated Communist or Marxist assault in these areas of the world which hang on the razor's edge of decision.;The Peace Corps, it seems to me, gives us an opportunity to emphasize a very different part of our American character, and that which has really been the motivation for American foreign policy, or much of it, since Woodrow Wilson, and that is the idealistic sense of purpose which I think motivates us, which is very important and a real part of American character, and has motivated a good deal of our international policy in the private church groups, in the aid groups, and all the others. It is a part of American character and purpose and policy which is submerged frequently by the press, by political speeches, by the political dialog that goes on in this country. But the great efforts which have been made by American missionaries in so many parts of the world, the AID programs and all the rest, have their roots not only in the national self-interest of the United States, but also in this quality.;The Peace Corps, it seems to me, gives this particular side of American life a channel for expression and also gives us a chance to express it overseas.;I am not saying that we have enough teachers to teach all the people English who are today unable to speak it, that we have enough engineers to survey in Tanganyika every road, that we have enough people who are familiar with farming to teach farming to everyone who needs it. I know that foreign aid has been subjected to criticism recently, because they say there are not enough capital resources in the free world to materially affect the lives of all the millions of people who live on the edge of starvation. That may be true, but it does indicate a sense of hope, and it does indicate the Peace Corps, even though there may be only a thousand scattered thinly around through millions of people, it does give us a chance to call attention to a side of our life which is extremely important, and which is so frequently ignored.;This is unrelated, now, to your question, but another side of American life which is ignored is the cultural side of American life. More people play musical instruments probably in the United States than any other country in proportion to our population. More people go to concerts in the United States than, almost, go to ball games. The best chamber music in the world is played in the United States, in Vermont, in a small town. There are more boys orchestras and girls orchestras and choirs in this country than probably any place in the world. Yet it is a side of American life which is almost unnoticed.;When my brother came back from his trip, particularly to Japan and Indonesia, what struck him so remarkably was the impression of America which is half a century old, which is in many places unsatisfactory, which is held by so many of the students who will be the future leaders of these countries.;This side of American life--the Peace Corps, the great emphasis which has been placed in our country on the development of cultural assets--these are terribly important things when people are determining which represents the best hope for them.;So, in answer to your question, I think the Peace Corps, a vivid and obvious demonstration of this side of American life, is of great material help to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore to the peace of the world.;[2.] Q. Mr. President, for some of us not quite so educated on the subject, I wonder if you could give us some of your understanding of this fluctuation of the stock market as related to our national economy?;Mr. Shriver: That question, obviously, is not very closely related to the Peace Corps. But Mr. President, would you like to talk about the market?;THE PRESIDENT. I suppose in a sense there is a relation, because so much of the strength of the United States and its foreign policy abroad is related to its domestic economy at home. I think as I stated the other day the market was selling at an average of about 23 times earnings. Some stocks were selling at 40 times earnings, which is an extremely high ratio when you consider it would only represent a sound investment if you were going to have a tremendous increase in the cost of living, or if you were having a tremendous inflationary pressure. As wholesale prices have been relatively stable, in fact the wholesale price index is almost the same as it was in 1958, you do not have a strong inflationary pressure, and in fact have not had it for a period of 3 or 4 years.;But nevertheless, a good many people thought we did have it. I think in my speech in New Haven on Monday, when I went into great detail about some of the differences between the realities and the myths of some of our economic life, I attempted to indicate what the effect was. I think because we had a deficit in fiscal 1962, it was assumed that automatically we would have an inflationary spiral. That has not been true. Inflationary pressures are not particularly strong in our economy at the present time. Therefore, you cannot justify, as I think the market has found, the selling at 23 to 1, or as I say in some cases, 40, 45, and 50 to 1, which represents, of course, an investment which most people would not regard as particularly stable at a time of stable prices.;The more basic question, of course, of the economy is whether we can maintain a forward thrust. We had a recession in 1958. We had a recession in 1960. We do not want to have a recession again.;So this represents a major challenge, of course, to all of us--members of the Chamber of Commerce, business, government, labor, all Americans. And what I have been attempting to suggest is that we should look at these problems in the sense of management of a complicated economy with a tremendous effect on what we do here and abroad, that we should think anew. We should, as Abraham Lincoln said, disenthrall ourselves, and it is to that effort that we have been attempting to carry on some dialog, and I hope, although I know Mr. Shriver does keep you busy reading, that you might have a chance to read my speech on Monday at New Haven at which I attempted to suggest some of the areas where we could usefully disenthrall ourselves, if we are going to be able to manage our economy.;[3.] Q. What are the chances of diverting moneys from our space program, not the military aspects, but in getting to the moon and projects like that?;THE PRESIDENT. Diverting money from those programs? Well, I support the program. I do not think the United States can afford to become second in space because I think that space has too many implications militarily, politically, psychologically, and all the rest.;I saw a survey taken the other day of young French students, asking which countries they regarded as ahead in various areas or which systems. About 67 or 68 percent regarded the Soviet Union as being first in science and technology.;I would not regard that as a very satisfactory statistic. I think the fact that the Soviet Union was ahead first in space in the fifties had a tremendous impact upon a good many people who were attempting to make a determination as to whether they could meet their economic problems without engaging in a Marxist form of government. I think the United States cannot permit the Soviet Union to become dominant in the sea of space. There are many military implications to it which are still yet unknown. And in addition, I think that the political and psychological effects are also serious.;The amount of money that we are putting in of course is substantial, but it also will bring with it a good many industrial benefits that we are only beginning to see. So I must say the decision made by the administration to make a more determined effort in space is not merely to take some man to the moon, but rather to have the capability.;As I said last year, the significance of Lindbergh's flight to Paris was not because he wanted to get to Paris but because rather it demonstrated a competence in the field of air travel which could have significance in after years.;So it is with space. Space may be the means of transportation. It has military implications and all the rest. So I must say I am completely committed to the concept that the United States must make a determined effort in the field of space, and no one can tell me that the United States cannot afford to do what the Soviet Union has done so successfully with a national income of less than half of ours.;[4.] Q. Would you care to comment, sir, on the prospects of the concept for a domestic Peace Corps?;THE PRESIDENT. Of course we have in a sense a good many areas of the Peace Corps as a formal organization. However, based upon the idea of service compensated by the National Government to work in various communities, juvenile delinquency and all the rest--is that what you are asking about?;Q. It was mentioned in a commencement address by Mrs. Shriver.;THE PRESIDENT. I saw that speech. I was interested in it. I thought the idea has merit, but she has not briefed me fully on exactly what her proposal is. One of the problems that I think we ought to be concerned about is Americans. I know juvenile delinquency is talked about all the time, but it is a major problem and it is going to become more serious. One-fourth of all the boys and girls under 20 now are unemployed. We are going to have 8 million school dropouts in this decade. We are moving into a period where the demand for unskilled labor is substantially decreasing, where the big demand is going to be for skilled labor. Now, you are going to have these millions of boys and girls, many of them members of minority groups, living in areas which are basically underprivileged, where the employment opportunities are limited, and you are going to have millions of them looking for work. Bad housing, bad social conditions, and all the rest I consider them to be major problems that this country is going to face in this decade. We face it right here in Washington, D.C.;Now, we have begun in New York City through the cooperation of the National Government and the city of New York. We have set aside an area in New York City, a geographic area where combined with the help of private foundations, the National Government, the city, and the State, a combined attack is going to be made in a small city area on juvenile problems. It is going to be done on the question of employment, education, recreation, employment counseling, motivation, and all the rest. We are going to try to see if by the expenditure of seed funds we can make an appreciable dent in the problem in that particular district.;In some of these areas, in Harlem and so on, you have 65, 70, 75 percent of the boys of school age who have dropped out of school unemployed. What is true there is also true, as I have said, in the District of Columbia. We have a very serious problem in that area in our own home town. So I think my sister Eunice and others are concerned in our zeal for sending Americans to serve overseas that we also concern ourselves with this problem here.;So I think the suggestion has merit. I think its organization and how it ought to be developed and what exactly its services ought to be should be very carefully examined. There may be an opportunity for great service on an organized basis here in our own country, and what role the Federal Government should play is one that has to be considered carefully. But I think that Mrs. Shriver's concern, and the concern of all of us, is that we meet our problem here, and particularly the problem that faces us in the area of young people who are adrift and who make a decision at 13, 14, or 15, or the decision is made for them, to drop out of school, and they never recover. They are the ones we ought to think about in the coming months and years.;So I think there is a great chance here and we ought to think about it very carefully.;[5-] Q. Mr. President, some of us have not been satisfied with the number of Negroes, Mexican Americans, and others who have presented themselves for consideration in the Peace Corps. I would suspect it is because of domestic concerns, preoccupation's, the kind of domestic cynicism. Do you have anything to say to those potential Peace Corps volunteers that might point out to them the desirability of service in the Peace Corps, or how they can face up to what appears to them to be a contradiction?;THE PRESIDENT. I think it is not only for the reason that you suggested, but also because again motivation, the desire to go away from the country or out of the country and serve is in a sense the result of motivations which, if I may use the word, are somewhat sophisticated. And it is quite natural that growing up surrounded by endless problems, as most of them do, that they would not be as concerned about the opportunity to serve abroad as they would be about the very difficult problems that they face in their own lives, in their families' lives, and in their neighborhood.;In addition, there is a denial of opportunity and therefore we have, for example, been working very hard in trying to get a Negro to go to the Coast Guard. We don't have any Negro in the Coast Guard Academy. Well, the demand for the opportunity for those Negroes who have sufficient educational ability and have had a sufficient chance to go to school--they can do many things. There are many demands for them. They can be lawyers, they can go to many schools. They don't want to particularly spend their lives in the Coast Guard. The same is true with the Peace Corps. The kinds of boys and girls who can pass the very exacting test for the Peace Corps have so many responsibilities thrust upon them in working in their own communities and in working for their people in their own way that they really feel that they cannot afford, in a sense, the diversion of going across the ocean.;We have to meet that in two ways. One, explain to them in serving overseas they are serving their own country and their people in the best sense of the word, and secondly, to give a good deal more attention ourselves to the problems of their own neighborhoods which I spoke about earlier. Mexicans and Puerto Ricans have a special skill in language and an inborn feeling about Latin culture and background and feelings that make them very valuable in the Peace Corps.;The same is true of Negroes in many areas of the world. So we hope to have them.;In addition, my own hope is that the Peace Corps men and women will also be encouraged enough to come and serve in the foreign Service, that this will be one of the great recruiting grounds for the foreign Service after they have gotten out of the Peace Corps, that this will not be a temporary experience for 2 years, but instead will bring them in and they will then come to us so that we will have them available. They are exactly the kind of people that we want to get into the foreign Service, that we need.;One of the problems we have had in the foreign Service, of course, is the inadequacy of the so-called minority groups at the higher levels. If we can get them started through the Peace Corps and then into the foreign Service, I think this country will be much stronger.;The question really goes not to how we can get them into the foreign Service, but how we can get them to play a much fuller part in all aspects of American life--Government and private.;I am going to have a press conference this afternoon, so perhaps I can answer one more question, and then we can all go back to work.;[6.] Q. Mr. President, why does not the United States offer to send some Government food to Red China? I understand that Red China has not offered much aid but I think it would be a very good idea for America to do this to change this, this image of America to--;THE PRESIDENT. The question was why don't we offer to send food to Red China. I have stated that we do meet, as you know, with the Chinese Communists in Warsaw at a-month intervals. There are two Americans that I know about quite intimately that are still imprisoned, ever since 1951, who took part in the Korean War in Red China, one called Downey from Wallingford, Conn., the other, Fecteau from Lowell, Mass., both very young men, 21 or 22, and they've been taken prisoner and they are still there, 10 years later. I think that the Chinese Communist regime has been extremely hostile to us in their propaganda, and so on. I think that there has been no indication that they want the food. There has been no indication that they desire it. They have never asked us for it, and they have never suggested that they wish us to discuss it with them. And I must say that I think that it is only proper, given the problems that we do have, that at least some indication come from them before we decide what we should do, rather than the United States making an offer that might be summarily refused, and without any indication or guarantees that the food would be distributed in a way that would meet our desires, which would be to help the Chinese people.;So I think we ought to stick with our policy which is to do nothing on the food until there is some indication that the Chinese Communists desire it, and then consider it on an independent basis at that time. Until that time comes, it does not seem that it is fruitful for us to go ahead.;I am glad to have a chance to discuss these. I am sure you have many suggestions and proposals, and that is the reason you are here, and I think it is rather useful to have a chance to come over here this morning.;I want to express again my thanks to you all. What we want here in the National Government, what we need are some new faces with new thoughts, and I am hopeful that those of you who are in the Peace Corps, as I said, will regard this as only the first step in governmental service. I can assure you that the next 10 or 20 years are going to be among the most critical and sensitive for the United States of any in our history. I cannot believe that there is any private career that will offer you half the rewards in the sense of doing a job that is important that Government service will do, so I hope that the experience that you will gain during your service in the Peace Corps in the next 18 months to 2 years will only be the beginning in a long journey in the service of our country. It is the most rewarding--not in the material sense but in a real sense. And the place to be in the 1960's, I believe, is in the service of our country, and it is for that reason that I want to thank you for beginning that voyage in 1962.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Remarks at a Dinner Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Department of Labor.</td><td class="c6">March 4, 1963</td><td class="c7">Secretary Wirtz, Madam Perkins, Mr. Justice Goldberg, Secretary Mitchell, Governor Hodges, Mr. Meany, ladies and gentlemen;Perhaps for my own information I am wondering how many people here tonight are fellow employees of the Government, work for the Department of Labor, or is married to somebody in the Department of Labor? Perhaps they could hold up their hands.;And then how many people here hold a union card or is married to somebody who holds a union card? They've got labor segregated over there!;Well, I want to express my appreciation to both groups, first those who work for the Department of Labor and have made it what it is today. I think that this is an extraordinary record that we read off: for example, the program which Madam Perkins put forward when she became the Secretary of Labor, things which we now take for granted in both political parties and which were regarded as dangerous and revolutionary and things which must be fought for in the short space of 30 years ago. They were controversial and Madam Perkins-who looked so quiet and peaceful and sweet--was also one of the most controversial, dangerous figures that roamed the United States in the 1930's.;It gives us some hope that some of the things which may be suggested today, which are not controversial but which may be regarded as controversial, 10 or 20 years from now will be accepted as part of the ordinary life of Americans. That's what progress is.;We don't have child labor today, but it was a hard fight getting rid of it. We still have some, unfortunately. We don't have people working 12 hours a day. We don't have women exploited. All these things, however, took years of effort on behalf of a number of Secretaries of Labor and the people who worked in the Department and also men and women who worked in organized labor.;Madam Perkins said 15 million Americans were unemployed for a period of 6 or 7 or 8 years, with a much smaller percentage of the population, 20 million Americans, on relief 30 years ago. We have very difficult problems today, they are more difficult in some ways and they are more complicated, but we still need the devoted service of the men and women who work in the Department of Labor, who work for the United States Government.;I don't know why it is that expenditures which deal with the enforcement of the minimum wage, that deal with the problem of school dropouts, of retraining of workers, of unskilled labor, all the problems that are so much with us in the sixties, why they are always regarded as the waste in the budget, and expenditures for defense are always regarded as the untouchable item in the budget.;I think that in short I recognize that we have a good deal of unfinished business in the 1960's. And I think it is up to us, both those who work for this great Department and those who work in the field of organized labor, the men and women who head the unions, who work in the unions, it's up to us to do the job in our time as was done in the long 50 years of this Department's history.;Terence Powderly, who was the leader of the Knights of Labor a hundred years ago, once said, "An injury to one is of concern to all." That is a good motto for this Department, a good motto today for organized labor. It is a good motto today for the United States of America. It has motivated the trade union movement in this country since its inception. And, as Justice Goldberg said, it has also motivated the American labor movement in its encouragement of other men and women in other countries who desire to be free and can only maintain their freedom if they have a strong, free labor movement. An injury to one, whether it's a man, woman, or country, is of concern to us all here and around the world.;I express my thanks to you all and I hope that in our time we will do as well as those who have been before us.;Thank you.;[The President spoke first to a group in the hotel's Banquet Hall and then to a group Sheraton Hall.];Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, Madam Perkins, Mr. Justice, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Meany, ladies and gentlemen;Among the hardest fought for and most dearly held rights are the 8-hour day. Therefore, I shall be very brief because this celebration has gone on for at least 18 hours today!;I come here tonight to express my thanks, and I think the country's thanks, to all the men and women who work in the Department of Labor. I know that those who work for the Federal Government are frequently unsung and usually not spoken of in the admiring terms which I think they deserve. But I think it is appropriate on this 50th anniversary that we pay tribute to them. They work in some of the most significant, sensitive, important work for the benefit of American men and women of any group of our countrymen in our long history.;I don't know how many are here tonight. Perhaps they would hold up their hands, everybody who works for the Department of Labor. This is not to get a list for our Democratic dinner, but just to find out who is here. Would you perhaps hold up your hands, everybody here who works for the Department of Labor or would like to?;And now perhaps all of those who work for the labor movement, with it, holds a union card, or is married to someone who does? Down in the other room they are all in back. Now you have them all down front.;I want to express our thanks to all of you. This is a young department and it is a young country. A hundred years ago the average wage in America was about a dollar a day. We had less railroads than India has today. The life expectancy of a baby in this country was about that of a child today in Tanganyika. The most extraordinary progress has been made in the last 50 years. And a good deal of that progress has been because of the work of the Department, and also because of the work of the men and women in the labor movement.;Miss Perkins was telling us that when she became Secretary of Labor there were 15 million Americans out of work and there were 20 million Americans on relief, and we had a much smaller population. That was within the lifetime of everyone in this room, within the past 25 years.;Everything that we should be doing now for the advancement of this country's interest should be with that shadow of our very difficult past in our minds, and all of our efforts which are frequently inadequate, to provide a better life for our people, we should not have to fight for and struggle for, but, instead, we should recognize how fortunate we are in the 1960's, those of us who live in this country, those of us who work in this country, and make sure that in the decade of the sixties, in those years when we have some responsibility for the welfare of our country, that we meet our task as our predecessors in this department, as our predecessors in the labor movement have met theirs, and make our present possible and our future hopeful.;I express my thanks to all of you, to the former Secretaries, to Mr. Meany and the leaders of the AFL. They deserve well of the country and I think if they keep working the country will benefit from them in the future.;Thank you.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Letter to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House Transmitting Bill To Strengthen the Peace Corps.</td><td class="c6">July 4, 1963</td><td class="c7">Dear Mr.;I am pleased to transmit legislation which will authorize the appropriation of $108 million for the Peace Corps in Fiscal Year 1964. It is fitting that this request is made on the 187th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. For the Peace Corps exemplifies the spirit of that revolution whose beginnings we celebrate today.;That revolution was not only a revolution for American independence and freedom. It was, as Jefferson perceived and Lincoln proclaimed, a revolution unbounded by geography, race or culture. It was a movement for the political and spiritual freedom Of man.;Today, two centuries later and thousands of miles from its origin, the men and women of the Peace Corps are again affirming the universality of that revolution. Whether expressed by the community development projects of Latin America, or the panchayati raj program of India, the determination of people to be free, to govern themselves, and to share in the fruits of both the industrial and democratic revolutions, is one of the most profound forces at work in the world. To this revolution Peace Corps Volunteers are giving the same qualities of energy and spirit to which the 21 year older Lafayette and his equally youthful contemporaries gave as volunteer participants in our own revolution.;In less than two years their accomplishments have already been impressive. They constitute more than one-third of all the qualified secondary teachers in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and Nyasaland, they have saved a three-quarter million dollar rice crop in Pakistan, they have vaccinated over 25,000 Bolivians, they are teaching in 400 Philippines schools, they have created a thriving poultry industry in the State of Punjab in India, they are teaching in every rural secondary school in Costa Rica and virtually every secondary school in British Honduras, they have contributed to the creation of a system of farm-to-market roads in Tanganyika. But these are only isolated examples, all over the world Volunteers have surveyed roads, taught students and teachers, built schools, planted forests, drilled wells, and started local industries. In their off-hours they have conducted adult education classes, organized athletic teams, and launched programs ranging from music clubs to debating teams.;As important as these achievements are, they are far less important than the contribution Peace Corps Volunteers are making in building those human relations which must exist for a happy and peaceful understanding between people. The United States and a few other fortunate nations are part of an island of prosperity in a world-wide sea of poverty. Our affluence has at times severed us from the great poverty stricken majority of the world's people. It is essential that we demonstrate that we continue to be aware of the responsibility we fortunate few have to assist the efforts of others at development and progress.;With Americans, Lord Tweedsmuir wrote, "the sense of common humanity is a warm and constant instinct and not a doctrine of the schools or a slogan of the hustings." By the careful selection and training of men and women in whom that instinct is a reality, the Peace Corps has already erased some stereotyped images of America and brought hundreds of thousands of people into contact with the first Americans they have ever known personally. "When the Peace Corps came to my country," wrote the Minister of Development of Jamaica, "they brought a breath of fresh air. They came and mixed with the people. They worked closely with the people. They dosed the gap and crashed the barrier. And because they did this, they have paved me way for our own people to understand...;It is no accident that Peace Corps Volunteers have won this kind of acceptance. Nor is it a coincidence that they have been greeted--as the Ethiopian Herald stated-"with open arms." They have been warmly received because they represent the best traditions of a free and democratic society--the kind of society which the people of Africa, Asia, and Latin America long for as the ultimate end of their own revolution.;The Communist system can never offer men optimum freedom as human beings. The people of the world's emerging nations know this. Their aspirations for a free society are being stimulated by the presence of Peace Corps Volunteers who have come not to usurp but to encourage the responsibility of local people and not to repress but to respect the individual characteristics and traditions of the local culture. "What is most remarkable about America," wrote German scholar, Philip Schaff, "is that over its confused diversity there broods a higher unity." Because Volunteers of different races and different religions nonetheless come from the same country, they represent the hope of building a community of free nations wherein each one, conscious of its rights and duties, will have regard for the welfare of all.;Already the Peace Corps idea has spread to other nations. Last week I attended the official inauguration of West Germany's own Peace Corps program. The first group of 250 young men and women will be ready for service next year and will eventually include more than a thousand young Germans working around the world. Three other European countries--the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway--have started similar programs. Argentina and New Zealand have already established volunteer organizations. These efforts have been stimulated and assisted by the International Peace Corps Secretariat, established by the International Conference on Middle Level Manpower last fall in Puerto Rico. The bill I am transmitting would enable the United States to continue to encourage this movement.;The first American Volunteers are already returning to the United States after two years of Peace Corps service. They are bringing home important skills and experience which will greatly enhance our knowledge of the world and strengthen our role in international affairs. More than one-third of the 700 Volunteers returning this year have indicated a desire to work international programs. Their ability and usefulness is attested to by the action of thirty-five universities in the United States which have established two hundred scholarships for returning Volunteers. 'One of these scholarships was created by the donations of the foreign students studying in California. I am also recommending a provision which would authorize the Peace Corps to assist these returning Volunteers to make the most of their opportunities for further usefulness to the Nation.;The funds I am requesting will enable the Peace Corps to place some 13,000 Volunteers in training or abroad by September 1964, a significant increase over the 9,000 who are expected to be enrolled before the end of this year.;Three thousand Volunteers of next year's increase are destined for service in Latin America and one thousand in Africa. In both of these areas an historic opportunity is at hand for the United States. In Latin America, the Peace Corps can, within the span of a relatively few years, write an important chapter in the history of Inter-American partnership and kindle faith in the possibilities of democratic action on the community level. In Africa the Peace Corps will concentrate its efforts on meeting a critical teacher shortage. The opportunity to teach hundreds of thousands of African students is unparalleled in our history.;It is my hope, therefore, that the Congress will enact this legislation making it possible for the Peace Corps to continue to share with the new nations of the world the experience of a democratic revolution committed to human liberty.;Sincerely;JOHN F. KENNEDY</td></tr>

I think it is most appropriate that this ceremony should be held between the White House on the one side and, on the other, between the Washington Monument and the memorial to Thomas Jefferson, because, in a very real sense, our guest of honor today, the President of Tanganyika, has played a role comparable to those distinguished Americans in the founding of his country.;President Nyerere led the fight, led the way, led the path to independence for his own country and he has recognized, as our early Founding Fathers recognized, that that was only part of the struggle and in some ways the easiest part. It is more difficult to build a cohesive society once independence has been founded, and it is for that, Mr. President, and for your efforts in this regard that you are most admired in this country.;This is the great test of the statesman, to build, once independence has been achieved. Your efforts to build a cohesive, open society, a free society, based on liberal principles, and also to build this society and this country as part of a larger organization of East Africa, has won the respect and admiration of the Government and the people of the United States. You are engaged in a great work, Mr. President, and we feel that it is most opportune that you should visit the United States in the summer of 1963 when so much is changing in your own country and in Africa. And where so much is changing here.;Progress, we hope, will mark the year 1963 in every field, internationally, nationally, in this continent, in this hemisphere, in your continent, in your hemisphere and throughout the world. And it is, therefore, a most happy occasion for all of us to welcome a distinguished leader of Africa, a distinguished leader of his own country, a distinguished leader for peace and justice throughout the world, the President of Tanganyika, President Nyerere.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Toasts of the President and President Nyerere of Tanganyika.</td><td class="c6">July 16, 1963</td><td class="c7">Mr. President;I want to express our very warm welcome to you, Mr. President, and to the Foreign Minister, to your representative at the United Nations, to the other members of your Government to the White House and to the United States.;I think that history will record this past decade in Africa as really one of the most astonishing bursts of human energy, human initiative, and responsibility that I think the world has ever known. Empires which were built up over hundreds of years were liquidated in a compressed period of time, and the leadership which arose out of those old colonial empires has proved to be a progressive and in nearly every case attempting to develop in their own countries a better society and more productive life for their people.;The President of Tanganyika has been one of the leaders in that astonishing movement, and he has kept in mind three or four objectives and purposes which he has either seen materialized or he is confident, I think, with good historical backing will materialize. The freedom of his own country in which he was the leader, a liberal society in his own country open to all, nonracial and forward-looking, he has worked for the unity of East Africa and he has worked for a free Africa from the North to the South. All of these great historic trends with which he has been so identified are moving towards fruition, and while the task before him and the other leaders of Africa are monumental-building a new, free society, educating their people, providing jobs for them, doing all the things which are necessary in this very changing and dangerous world--I think the President of Tanganyika deserves a high place not only in his own country and in Africa, but among all of us who wish to see the United States associated with what has been this great trend towards national independence and within each national sovereign unit personal independence.;So, Mr. President, we are very glad to have you here. The guests at this lunch come from all parts of the United States. Their presence here, I think, indicates the strong commitments that I think all Americans feel about self-determination, about individual liberty, about national independence, and about progress for all people. This is what the United States stands for in the best sense. We are short of our goals, but it is where we are going, and we are proud to welcome from the other side of the waters and almost from the other side of the world a leader who is doing in his own country what we are trying to do here.;I hope all of you will join me in toasting to the good health of the President of Tanganyika and the people of Tanganyika.</td></tr>

Kennedy: Joint Statement Following Discussions With President Nverere of Tanganyika.</td><td class="c6">July 16, 1963</td><td class="c7">MWALIMU Julius K. Nyerere, President of the Republic of Tanganyika, met yesterday and today with the President. They discussed political developments in Africa as related to world developments and those developments affecting the relations of the United States and Tanganyika.;President Nyerere reviewed for the President the decisions taken by the recent African heads of state meeting in Addis Ababa and stressed the importance of the establishment at that meeting of an Organization of African Unity. President Nyerere also outlined the steps being taken to form an East African federation at an early date.;The President reviewed the United States position on world issues of interest to Tanganyika, stressing particularly the importance of promoting peace and economic progress within a framework of freedom. The President confirmed the continuing support of the United States for the principle of self-determination and expressed confidence in even greater cooperation and understanding between the United States and Tanganyika.;President Nyerere thanked the President for the warm welcome which he and his party had received on his first visit to the United States since Tanganyika 's independence.</td></tr>

Johnson: Remarks in San Francisco at a Democratic Fundraising Dinner.</td><td class="c6">June 19, 1964</td><td class="c7">Governor Brown, Mayor Shelley, former Secretary and future Senator Pierre Salinger, Members of this great California congressional delegation, and all of you wonderful people who make this evening possible;I want to confess that I was somewhat surprised when Pierre told me that he intended to run for Senator in a State more than 500 miles long. It was just a few months ago that he refused to walk even 50 miles.;The real reason Pierre decided to run has been a closely kept secret. Tonight I can let it be known: I wouldn't let him play the piano at my press conferences.;But it did take Pierre a little longer to make up his mind than you would suspect. He couldn't decide to run in California or Virginia. There is one blessing in all of this, of course: he can't smoke those cigars in the Senate Chamber. But I am very proud of you good people of California and the contribution that your voters have made to the economy drive. Since Pierre already lives there in Virginia, we won't have to pay to move him to Washington.;And by the way, Pierre, Secretary McNamara sends his regards. You know who I am talking about. You know him. McNamara. M-c-N-a-m.--;It is wonderful to be out here in this enlightened, progressive State. Thirty-two years ago Franklin Roosevelt came to San Francisco and declared that "America is new. It is in the process of change and development. It has great potentialities of youth, and particularly is this true of the great West, and of this coast, and of all of the great State of California.;Well, I think if Franklin D. Roosevelt were here tonight he would not have to change his text. America is still a young Nation. It is rich in talent, robust in energy, resplendent in the promise of a better life for all people.;And the West, this coast, the great State of California, have vindicated Franklin Roosevelt's vision of your future when he predicted it 32 years ago. You have turned what Daniel Webster once called "a wasteland" into a wonderland of opportunity.;When President Roosevelt campaigned here three decades ago, California was 6th among the States in population.;When our beloved John F. Kennedy and I campaigned here 4 years ago, you were second.;And tonight California is first--although I hope you won't tell them back in Texas that I said that.;California is not just the last frontier of an immense continent but the new frontier of an inspired civilization. For we have set America on the road to excellence--and in following that course we need the vision and the valor of the pioneers who crossed deserts and conquered mountains to turn a barren land into a bountiful life.;The path we have chosen will be hard, the perils will be great, the price will be high. But on the other side lies the Great Society-a place where a life of decency and dignity is within the reach of every man, a place where our people live in clean cities, where they breathe fresh air, where they drink pure water, where our children, all our children, study in good schools, and live in good homes, and play in good parks, and where all men know the fulfillment of personal happiness because they enjoy the freedom of personal opportunity.;We started across these frontiers 4 years ago, right here in San Francisco, when we heard a bold challenge from a brave crusader--John Fitzgerald Kennedy.;The theme of this campaign," he said, "is going to be action. Action here at home to keep pace with our growing country... and action abroad to meet the challenge of;Our adversaries.;Here in the city where he spoke those words, I want the record to show tonight that John F. Kennedy redeemed his pledge. He promised the Democratic Party would give this country action again, and action is what he gave it and what we are giving it. We passed the civil rights bill in the Senate today by a vote of 73 to 27.;Tonight let us look at three pledges made in California in 1960 and translated into action in 1964.;First, we took immediate action to increase our military strength to unquestionable superiority and we are determined to keep it there.;In San Diego we declared that "America must have a military strength second to none -- strength which can survive and can guarantee survival.;Since 1960 we have increased our nuclear power on alert 2 1/2 times, and the intercontinental ballistic missiles and Polaris missiles in our arsenal have been increased from less than 100 to over 1,000. We have increased our combat ready divisions by 45 percent. We have increased our special forces eightfold. We have increased our airlift capability by 75 percent. We are increasing our supporting tactical aircraft by 30 percent,. and increasing the number of tactical nuclear warheads in Western Europe by more than 60 percent.;We have used that strength not to intimidate others, but we have used it to show others that we cannot and will not be intimidated ourselves. We have used that strength not to incite our enemies but to indicate our intention to defend freedom wherever it is necessary.;There are still those in this country who, believe that we must have strength. Some think that we go too far, too fast. But I have never seen a nation too strong, provided it used that strength to keep the peace.;There are still some in the world who believe they can violate their neighbor's borders, and some who believe that they can steal their neighbor's freedom. There are still those who refuse to accept the standards and the laws which the international community has developed.;And as long as these men persist in disturbing the international peace, we must insist on preserving our national power. And as long as I am President I intend to see that America's defense can never be the object of doubt and America's strength can never be the subject of suspicion. That is number one.;Second, we took immediate action to show friend and foe alike that all America seeks in the world tonight is peace and justice.;Those of you who heard the promise of a Peace Corps in the Cow Palace in 1960 will be proud to know that around the world tonight more than 7,000 young Americans-incidentally more than 10 percent of them from the great State of California--are giving quiet witness to the best of America's ideals. From Borneo to Bolivia, from India to Tanganyika, they are translating good words into good deeds.;And I want to double the size of the Peace Corps. The nations of the world want our young people. The peoples of the world need our young people. And surely a nation rich in goods and ideals can provide young people.;You also heard the promise 4 years ago, right here in San Francisco, that we would seize the initiative in searching for ways to reduce the risks of nuclear holocaust.;Well, in 1961 we became the first nation to establish a disarmament agency in the world. And we have negotiated a limited nuclear test ban. We have established a "hot line" between Washington and Moscow, and, along with the Russians, we have cut back the production of materials used to make nuclear weapons. With each step the world has inched back from a nuclear precipice.;Through most of the years since World War II, America has been engaged in preventing conquests by communism. In the last few years the tide has turned. Tonight we are on the offensive in the pursuit of peace. We still face deadly dangers. We still face determined adversaries. But tonight we have the confidence in our strength and leadership which makes it possible for us to seek agreement without fearing the loss of our liberty. Unless our adversaries rashly mistake our intentions I predict that we will move closer to enduring peace in the coming decade than at any other time since the guns of August shattered the serenity of the earth half a century ago.;Third, we took immediate action to meet the hopes and widen the horizons of opportunity for every American.;In San Francisco, we said, "The pressure of our schools, the plight of our aged, the necessity of maintaining full employment, the necessity of expanding equal rights to all Americans--these are the things that require action.;Since 1960 we have enacted legislation and started programs to build almost 30 new public community colleges every year, to provide college classrooms for hundreds of thousands of new students, to provide loans that enable almost 100,000 additional Americans to attend college every year. But we have only just begun. In the next decade our goal is to open the door of higher education to every youngster in America who qualifies!;Since 1960 we have introduced and we have fought for a health plan to enable our older citizens to face the future without fear, and we are going to keep on fighting until that bill is the law of the land!;Since the beginning of 1961, 5 million new nonfarm jobs have been created and unemployment has been reduced by one-fifth while the labor force was growing by more than 3 million.;In California alone, more than 500,000 people have been added to the employment rolls since the beginning of 1961. More than 6,506,000 Californians--6,506,000 Californians-were working in the month of April this year--an all-time high for any April on record in our national history. And their wages were averaging better than $100 a week for every person employed.;Our tax cut will add 2 million new jobs, and we have urged Congress to pass programs that will train half a million workers a year in new skills. But as long as one American who is able to work cannot find a job, this administration and the National Democratic Party are not going to rest on our record.;We intend to work for a rapid rate of economic growth.;We are going to expand our investment in training new workers.;We are going to find ways to produce ever-better products at lower costs.;We will develop our tools of economic policy to cope with any signs of a recession.;And we will strive to remove any barriers that keep our fellow citizens from realizing their full potential.;Finally, since 1960 we have moved steadily toward full equality for all of our people. And I am proud to acknowledge that California, under the great leadership of Pat Brown and this delegation at this head table tonight, has led the march, has led the march toward the goal of decency and the goal of dignity for every American.;Today, the United States Senate passed the most comprehensive civil rights bill in 100 years. Our work is cut out for us and our job has just begun. It was 100 years ago that Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But until education is blind to color, and until employment is unaware of race, emancipation will be a proclamation but it will not be a fact.;I was leader of the Senate when we passed the first civil rights bill in more than 80 years in the Congress of the United States. It was just one step, in 1957. I was leader of the Senate when we passed the second civil rights bill in 85 years, in 1960.;I am proud that I am privileged to be President when the House and the Senate pass the greatest and best bill of them all in the year of Our Lord 1964.;Lastly and finally, this bill is a challenge, it is a challenge to men of good will in every part of the country to transform the commands of our law into the customs of our land. It is a challenge to all of us to go to work in our States, in our communities, in our homes, and, most of all, in the depths of our hearts, to eliminate the final strongholds of intolerance and hatred in our land.;It is a challenge to reach beyond the content of the bill, to conquer the barriers of poor education, poverty, squalid housing, which are an inheritance of past injustice and an impediment to future advance. Programs to improve the life of all underprivileged Americans will go far to liberate those who have suffered under the heavy weight of racial discrimination.;I want to say to you good people of California tonight that I do not underestimate for a moment the depth of the passions involved in the struggle for racial equality. But I also know that throughout this country, in every section of this land, there is a large reservoir of good will and compassion, of decency, love, and fair play, which seeks the vision of justice without violence in the streets.;If these good forces do not desert the field--and I appeal to you tonight in one of the first appeals I have made since this law was proposed--I appeal to the good people of California tonight not to desert the field. I appeal to you to come into the battle, to help us in the years of trial, m the belief that they will be a prelude to the final triumph of a land, a free land, with liberty and justice for all.;Yes, this year of our Lord 1964 is the year to reach that goal. Yes, this is the year to give every American an equal chance to send his little children to school, to give every American a chance to work, to vote, and to enjoy the benefits of a free society.;So tonight I congratulate the Senators and the Representatives of both parties who worked to make passage of that bill possible. I look forward to the day, which will not be long forthcoming, when the bill becomes law and I affix my signature. That will be a milestone in America's progress toward full justice for all of her citizens.;No single act of Congress can, by itself, eliminate discrimination and prejudice, and hatred and injustice. But this bill goes further to invest the rights of man with the protection of law than any legislation in this entire century.;First, it will provide a carefully designed code to test and enforce the right of every American to go to school, for every American to get a job, for every American to vote, and to pursue his life unhampered by the barriers of racial discrimination.;Second, it will, in itself, help educate all Americans to their responsibility to give equal treatment to their fellow citizens.;Third, it will enlist one of the most powerful moral forces of American society on the side of civil rights, the moral obligation to respect and obey the law of the land.;Fourth, and perhaps most important, this bill is a renewal and a reinforcement, a symbol and a strengthening of that abiding commitment to human dignity and the equality of man which has been the guiding purpose of the American Nation for 200 years.;This bill is the product not of any man or group of men, but of a broad, national consensus--73 to 27 in the Senate--that every person is entitled to justice, that every person is entitled to equality, and to an even chance to enjoy the blessings of liberty. It is in the highest traditions of a civilization which from the Magna Carta on has used the fabric of law for the fulfillment of liberty.;My friends, this ought to be a year of fulfillment-not of frustration. This ought to be a year of advance--not of apathy. Above all, it can be a year in which the rich promises of our past become the real performances of our present. We have come a long way in this country.;I see a friend out here in the audience, Otto Crider, who left Johnson City, Tex., with me 40 years ago. Both of us had less than $25 in our pocket. We didn't have a top on our car. It was an old "T" model. We started to follow the old philosopher's advice, Horace Greeley, and "Go West, Young Man" to seek our fortune. Well, Otto got up to Cloverdale and stayed there, and I think he is healthy and perhaps wealthy, and maybe wise. We both came here looking for a job, and I am back in the same mission tonight. You were good to me 40 years ago and you gave me that job, and I hope you love me in November as you do in June.;You have come a long way in California, but new frontiers are opening and we still have a long way to go.;In my old friend Pat Brown, here, you have a great Governor, and under his leadership and the leadership of the other State officials at this table tonight, California is moving ahead.;In Pierre Salinger you are going to have another effective Senator, he will be able to run in the White House almost as fast as he ran out. He will be taking the seat of that outstanding patriot and my beloved friend, your wonderful servant, Clair Engle.;The entire Nation and all the free world will be looking to California in the months ahead, to help us prepare and maintain our defenses on the land, in the sea, in the skies, and in outer space.;You have an outstanding congressional delegation. My old friend, George Miller, who lives not far from here, is the farsighted and able Chairman of the Space Committee of the House of Representatives, on which California relies so heavily.;I commend you for your entire Democratic congressional delegation, and I ask you, please, to enlarge it in November.;So let us resolve tonight to stand together for the programs that will give America more action and more progress for 4 more years. Let us resolve here tonight that in California and in the Nation the Democratic Party will be the party that worked for the people, will be the party that stood with the people, will be the party that believed in the people, will be the party that journeyed with the people across the New Frontiers toward a richer and better life for all human beings.;And tonight I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, who believe in the people, who want them to have a richer and better life, to join us in our march, because we are marching.;We have not come here to condemn or to confuse, or to even criticize. We have come here to ask all good Americans to unite under one great tent to give every American a better tomorrow than yesterday, a richer and better life for himself and for his children, and his grandchildren.;Thank you and goodnight.</td></tr>
